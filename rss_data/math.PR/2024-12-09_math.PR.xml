      <title>Critical Drift for Brownian Bees and a Reflected Brownian Motion Invariance Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $N$-Brownian bees is a branching-selection particle system in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in which $N$ particles behave as independent binary branching Brownian motions, and where at each branching event, we remove the particle furthest from the origin. We study a variant in which $d=1$ and particles have an additional drift $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. We show that there is a critical value, $\mu_c^N$, and three distinct regimes (sub-critical, critical, and super-critical) and we describe the behaviour of the system in each case. In the sub-critical regime, the system is positive Harris recurrent and has an invariant distribution; in the super-critical regime, the system is transient; and in the critical case, after rescaling, the system behaves like a single reflected Brownian motion.
  We also show that the critical drift $\mu_c^N$ is in fact the speed of the well-studied $N$-BBM process, and give a rigorous proof for the speed of $N$-BBM, which was missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Counting minimal cutsets and $p_c&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c&lt;1$, then the number of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c&lt;1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and provides a new proof that $p_c&lt;1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear growth.</description>

      <title>Solvable families of random block tridiagonal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two families of random tridiagonal block matrices for which the joint eigenvalue distributions can be computed explicitly. These distributions are novel within random matrix theory, and exhibit interactions among eigenvalue coordinates beyond the typical mean-field log-gas type. Leveraging the matrix models, we go on to describe the point process limits at the edges of the spectrum in two ways: through certain random differential operators, and also in terms of coupled systems of diffusions. Along the way we establish several algebraic identities involving sums of Vandermonde determinant products.</description>

      <title>Inverting the Markovian projection for pure jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markovian projections arise in problems where we aim to mimic the one-dimensional marginal laws of an It\^o semimartingale by using another It\^o process with simpler dynamics. In applications, Markovian projections are useful in calibrating jump-diffusion models with both local and stochastic features, leading to the study of the inversion problems. In this paper, we invert the Markovian projections for pure jump processes, which can be used to construct calibrated local stochastic intensity (LSI) models for credit risk applications. Such models are jump process analogues of the notoriously hard to construct local stochastic volatility (LSV) models used in equity modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of colored multiwebs, which generalizes the dimer model to allow each vertex to be adjacent to $n_v$ edges. These objects can be formulated as a random tiling of a graph with partial dimer covers. We examine the case of a cycle graph, and in particular we describe the local correlations of tiles in this setting.</description>

      <title>On one dimensional weighted Poincare inequalities for Global Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional Poincare inequalities are used in Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to provide derivative-based upper bounds and approximations of Sobol indices. We add new perspectives by investigating weighted Poincare inequalities. Our contributions are twofold. In a first part, we provide new theoretical results for weighted Poincare inequalities, guided by GSA needs. We revisit the construction of weights from monotonic functions, providing a new proof from a spectral point of view. In this approach, given a monotonic function g, the weight is built such that g is the first non-trivial eigenfunction of a convenient diffusion operator. This allows us to reconsider the linear standard, i.e. the weight associated to a linear g. In particular, we construct weights that guarantee the existence of an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions, leading to approximation of Sobol indices with Parseval formulas. In a second part, we develop specific methods for GSA. We study the equality case of the upper bound of a total Sobol index, and link the sharpness of the inequality to the proximity of the main effect to the eigenfunction. This leads us to theoretically investigate the construction of data-driven weights from estimators of the main effects when they are monotonic, another extension of the linear standard. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of using weights on a GSA study of two toy models and a real flooding application, involving the Poincare constant and/or the whole eigenbasis.</description>

      <title>Characterization of subordinate symmetric Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider subordinate symmetric Markov processes which correspond to non-killing Dirichlet forms enjoying heat kernel estimates on a metric measure space with the volume doubling property. We obtain estimates of the jump kernel of the subordinate process and establish equivalent conditions for the jump kernel following Liu-Murugan. In particular, we clarify the scale of the jump kernel, which is different from the diffusion type. This result is appliable to non-subordinate processes by the transferring method, which uses stability of Dirichlet forms.</description>

      <title>Sample path central limit theorem for the occupation time of the voter model on a lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the central limit theorem of the occupation time of the voter model on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ given in \cite{Cox1983} to the sample path case for $d\geq 3$. The proof of our main result utilizes the resolvent strategy and the Poisson flow strategy introduced in previous literatures, where the duality relationship between the voter model and the coalescing random walk plays the key role. For $d=2$ case, we give a conjecture about an analogue result of our main theorem.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of the Euler scheme for singular kinetic SDEs driven by $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong approximation of the solutions to singular stochastic kinetic equations (also referred to as second-order SDEs) driven by $\alpha$-stable processes, using an Euler-type scheme inspired by [11]. For these equations, the stability index $\alpha$ lies in the range $(1,2)$, and the drift term exhibits anisotropic $\beta$-H\"older continuity with $\beta &gt;1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}$. We establish a convergence rate of $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha(1+\alpha)} \wedge \frac{1}{2})$, which aligns with the results in [4] concerning first-order SDEs.</description>

      <title>Conditions for uniform in time convergence: applications to averaging, numerical discretisations and mean-field systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish general conditions under which there exists uniform in time convergence between a stochastic process and its approximated system. These standardised conditions consist of a local in time estimate between the original and the approximated process as well as of a contraction property for one of the processes and a uniform control for the other one. Specifically, the results we present provide global in time error bounds for multiscale methods and numerical discretisations as well as uniform in time propagation of chaos bounds for mean-field particle systems. We provide a general method of proof which can be applied to many types of approximation. In all three scenarios, examples where the joint conditions are verified and uniform in time convergence is achieved are given.</description>

      <title>Estimating Customers' Perception of Service Value and Potential Demand in a Two-station Service System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential demand in the market and customers' perception of service value are crucial factors in pricing strategies, resource allocation, and other operational decisions. However, this information is typically private and not readily accessible. In this paper, we analyze a service system operating across two stations, each with its own customer flow. Customers arriving at the system are informed of the waiting times at both stations and can choose to either join the local station, switch to the other station by incurring an immediate switching fee, or balk. Our objective is to estimate the arrival rates at each station and customers' perceived service value based on the observed workloads at both stations. A significant challenge arises from the inability to observe balking customers and the lack of distinction between local arrivals and customers switching from the other station, as the switching cost is unknown. To address this issue, we employ maximum likelihood estimation and validate the effectiveness of the estimator through a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>Approximate Computation of Loss Probability for Queueing System with Capacity Sharing Discipline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-channel queueing system is considered. The arriving requests differ in their type. Requests of each type arrive according to a Poisson process. The number of channels required for service with the rate equal to 1 depends of the request type. If a request is serviced with the rate equal to 1, then, by definition, the length of the request equals to the total service time. If at arrival moment, the idle channels is sufficient, then the arriving request is serviced with the rate 1. If, at the arrival moment, there are no idle channel, then the arriving request is lost. If, at arrival moment, there are idle channels but the number of idle channels is not sufficient for servicing with rate 1, then the request begins to be in service with rate equal to the ratio of the number of idle channels to the number of the channels required for service with the rate 1. If a request is serviced with a rate less than 1 and another request leaves the system, then the service rate increases for the request in consideration. Approximate formula for loss probability has been proposed. The accuracy of approximation is estimated. Approximate values are compared with exact values found from the system of equations for the related Markov chain stationary state probabilities.</description>

      <title>Intertwining vectors, and Boltzmann weight matrices, of a Solid-on-Solid model from the 20-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a new study on the correspondence between the 20-vertex model and a SOS (Solid-on-Solid) model. In comparison to two previous works of the author in 2024 which characterized properties of the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices of the 20-vertex model from the perspective of the quantum inverse scattering method, in addition to the structure of nonlocal correlations, the forthcoming approach is an adaptation of a study on the rational 7-vertex model. For the rational 7-vertex model, Antoenneko and Valinevich demonstrated that the intertwining vectors can be used to transform the R-matrix of a vertex model into the Boltzman weight matrix of an SOS model. To further develop perspectives on classes of higher dimensional SOS models, by leveraging previous computations with L-operators due to the author, and by also manipulating q-exponentials, and other related factors from a factorization of the universal R-matrix due to Boos et al, analogs of intertwining vectors for the 20- vertex model can be obtained. In comparison to the system of equations that have been obtained for the rational 7-vertex model, the system that one obtains for the 20-vertex model consists of 9 equations for each entry of the R-matrix. Furthermore, from the fact that the 20-vertex model contains more possible configurations in the sample space than the rational 7-vertex model does, the Boltzman weight matrix of the corresponding SOS model asymptotically depends upon several contributions, a few of which include tensor products of basis elements, and spectral parameters over the triangular lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Problems in probability theory prove to be one of the most challenging for students. Here, we formulate and discuss four related problems in probability theory that proved difficult for first to fourth-year undergraduate students whose first language was not English. These examples emphasize how crucial it is to understand the conditions and requirements of the problems precisely before starting to solve them. We discuss the solutions to those problems in detail, complement them with numerical estimations, and link the conditions in the problems to the logical statements in Python programming language. We also tested two widely used chatbots (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) by checking their responses to these problems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the set of zero-noise limits measures of perturbed cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the one-parameter family $(F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon&gt;0}$ parameterized by $\epsilon$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to study the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\epsilon$ tends to zero denoted $\Ml$. Some topological obstructions appear, $\Ml$ is compact and connected, as well as combinatorial obstructions as the set of cellular automata is countable: $\Ml$ is $\Pi_3$-computable in general and $\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly approached. Reciprocally, for any set of probability measures $\mathcal{K}$ which is compact, connected and $\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular automaton whose perturbations by an uniform noise admit $\mathcal{K}$ as the zero-noise limits measure and this set is uniformly approached. To finish, we study how the set of limiting invariant measures can depend on a bias in the noise. We construct a cellular automaton which realizes any connected compact set (without computable constraints) if the bias is changed for an arbitrary small value. In some sense this cellular automaton is very unstable with respect to the noise.</description>

Abstract: How should we model an observer within quantum mechanics or quantum field theory? How can classical physics emerge from a quantum model, and why should classical probability be useful? How can we model a selective measurement entirely within a closed quantum system? This paper sketches a new physical theory of probability based on an attempt to model classical information within a purely quantum system. We model classical information using a version of Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism, with emphasis on quantum information encoded using projection operators localised in spacetime. This version of Quantum Darwinism is compatible with quantum field theory, and does not require any artificial division of a quantum system into subsystems. The main innovation is our attempt to provide a physical explanation of probability. Decoherence is the physical mechanism behind Quantum Darwinism or the `branching of quantum worlds'. Assuming a type of perfect decoherence we construct a conventional probabilistic model for classical information. This, however, is not our theory of natural probability, and does not quite demonstrate the validity of Bayesian reasoning. Instead, our theory of natural probability arises from careful consideration of errors in decoherence: roughly speaking, we don't observe low probability events because they are swamped by quantum noise.</description>

      <title>Generating Rectifiable Measures through Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive universal approximation results for the class of (countably) $m$-rectifiable measures. Specifically, we prove that $m$-rectifiable measures can be approximated as push-forwards of the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ using ReLU neural networks with arbitrarily small approximation error in terms of Wasserstein distance. What is more, the weights in the networks under consideration are quantized and bounded and the number of ReLU neural networks required to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$ is no larger than $2^{b(\varepsilon)}$ with $b(\varepsilon)=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-m}\log^2(\varepsilon))$. This result improves Lemma IX.4 in Perekrestenko et al. as it shows that the rate at which $b(\varepsilon)$ tends to infinity as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero equals the rectifiability parameter $m$, which can be much smaller than the ambient dimension. We extend this result to countably $m$-rectifiable measures and show that this rate still equals the rectifiability parameter $m$ provided that, among other technical assumptions, the measure decays exponentially on the individual components of the countably $m$-rectifiable support set.</description>

      <title>Constructing Uncertainty Sets for Robust Risk Measures: A Composition of $\phi$-Divergences Approach to Combat Tail Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk measures, which typically evaluate the impact of extreme losses, are highly sensitive to misspecification in the tails. This paper studies a robust optimization approach to combat tail uncertainty by proposing a unifying framework to construct uncertainty sets for a broad class of risk measures, given a specified nominal model. Our framework is based on a parametrization of robust risk measures using two (or multiple) $\phi$-divergence functions, which enables us to provide uncertainty sets that are tailored to both the sensitivity of each risk measure to tail losses and the tail behavior of the nominal distribution. In addition, our formulation allows for a tractable computation of robust risk measures, and elicitation of $\phi$-divergences that describe a decision maker's risk and ambiguity preferences.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Transformer Models for Dark-Pattern Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opaque nature of transformer-based models, particularly in applications susceptible to unethical practices such as dark-patterns in user interfaces, requires models that integrate uncertainty quantification to enhance trust in predictions. This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design choices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We propose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final classification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based pre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as a baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty: Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source foundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in certainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference phases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification maintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances within the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact does not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty quantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in predictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This facilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of dark-patterns on user interfaces. These results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques in developing machine learning models, particularly in domains where interpretability and trustworthiness are critical.</description>

      <title>Structural results for the Tree Builder Random Walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Tree Builder Random Walk: a randomly growing tree, built by a walker as she is walking around the tree. Namely, at each time $n$, she adds a leaf to her current vertex with probability $p_n \asymp n^{-\gamma}$, $\gamma\in (2/3,1]$, then moves to a uniform random neighbor on the possibly modified tree. We show that the tree process at its growth times, after a random finite number of steps, can be coupled to be identical to the Barab\'asi-Albert preferential attachment tree model.
  Thus, our TBRW-model is a local dynamics giving rise to the BA-model. The coupling also implies that many properties known for the BA-model, such as diameter and degree distribution, can be directly transferred to our TBRW-model, extending previous results.</description>

      <title>The stability of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion as a bilinear matrix inequality problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the stability of the origin for the multivariate geometric Brownian motion. More precisely, under suitable sufficient conditions, we construct a Lyapunov function such that the origin of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is globally asymptotically stable in probability. Moreover, we show that such conditions can be rewritten as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) feasibility problem. We stress that no commutativity relations between the drift matrix and the noise dispersion matrices are assumed and therefore the so-called Magnus representation of the solution of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is complicated. In addition, we exemplify our method in numerous specific models from the literature such as random linear oscillators, satellite dynamics, inertia systems, diagonal and non-diagonal noise systems, cancer self-remission and smoking.</description>

      <title>Robust Sparse Recovery with Sparse Bernoulli matrices via Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse binary matrices are of great interest in the field of sparse recovery, nonnegative compressed sensing, statistics in networks, and theoretical computer science. This class of matrices makes it possible to perform signal recovery with lower storage costs and faster decoding algorithms. In particular, Bernoulli$(p)$ matrices formed by independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli$(p)$ random variables are of practical relevance in the context of noise-blind recovery in nonnegative compressed sensing.
  In this work, we investigate the robust nullspace property of Bernoulli$(p)$ matrices. Previous results in the literature establish that such matrices can accurately recover $n$-dimensional $s$-sparse vectors with $m=O\left(\frac{s}{c(p)}\log\frac{en}{s}\right)$ measurements, where $c(p) \le p$ is a constant dependent only on the parameter $p$. These results suggest that in the sparse regime, as $p$ approaches zero, the (sparse) Bernoulli$(p)$ matrix requires significantly more measurements than the minimal necessary, as achieved by standard isotropic subgaussian designs. However, we show that this is not the case.
  Our main result characterizes, for a wide range of sparsity levels $s$, the smallest $p$ for which sparse recovery can be achieved with the minimal number of measurements. We also provide matching lower bounds to establish the optimality of our results and explore connections with the theory of invertibility of discrete random matrices and integer compressed sensing.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy problem for the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative noise is considered where the nonlinear term is of power type and the noise coefficients are purely imaginary numbers. The main purpose of this paper is to construct classical solutions in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for the problem. The techniques of Kato \cite{K87,K89} work well in overcoming this difficulty even for the stochastic equations.</description>

Abstract: Based on supermodularity ordering properties, we show that convex risk measures of credit losses are nondecreasing  w.r.t. credit-credit and, in a wrong-way risk setup, credit-market, covariances of elliptically distributed latent factors. These results support the use of such setups for computing credit provisions and economic capital or for conducting stress test exercises and risk management analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Diffusion Monte Carlo method with constant number of walkers, also called Stochastic Reconfiguration as well as Sequential Monte Carlo, is a widely used Monte Carlo methodology for computing the ground-state energy and wave function of quantum systems. In this study, we present the first mathematically rigorous analysis of this class of stochastic methods on non necessarily compact state spaces, including linear diffusions evolving in quadratic absorbing potentials, yielding what seems to be the first result of this type for this class of models. We present a novel and general mathematical framework with easily checked Lyapunov stability conditions that ensure the uniform-in-time convergence of Diffusion Monte Carlo estimates towards the top of the spectrum of Schr\"odinger operators. For transient free evolutions, we also present a divergence blow up of the estimates w.r.t. the time horizon even when the asymptotic fluctuation variances are uniformly bounded. We also illustrate the impact of these results in the context of generalized coupled quantum harmonic oscillators with non necessarily reversible nor stable diffusive particle and a quadratic energy absorbing well associated with a semi-definite positive matrix force.</description>

Abstract: We study a hierarchical model of non-overlapping cubes of sidelengths $2^j$, $j \in \mathbb{Z}$. The model allows for cubes of arbitrarily small size and the activities need not be translationally invariant. It can also be recast as a spin system on a tree with long-range hard-core interaction. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Gibbs measures, discuss fragmentation and condensation, and prove bounds on the decay of two-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Perfect sampling from rapidly mixing Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that efficient approximate sampling algorithms, combined with a slow exponential time oracle for computing its output distribution, can be combined into constructing efficient perfect samplers, which sample exactly from a target distribution with zero error upon termination. This extends a classical reduction of Jerrum, Valiant and Vazirani, which says that for self-reducible problems, deterministic approximate counting can be used to construct perfect samplers. We provide two surprisingly simple constructions, and our perfect samplers run in polynomial time both in expectation and with high probability.
  An overwhelming amount of efficient approximate sampling algorithms are based on Markov chains. Informally, we show that any Markov chains with absolute spectral gap $\gamma$ can be converted into a perfect sampler with expected time $O\left(\frac{1}{\gamma}\ln\frac{|\Omega|}{\pi_{*}}\right)$, where $\pi_{*}$ is the minimum probability in the stationary distribution. This is also the best possible bound for mixing time to achieve approximate sampling from a spectral gap, and we are able to do perfect sampling in the same time bound in expectation.
  We also highlight a number of applications where we either get the first perfect sampler up to the uniqueness regime (roughly speaking, everywhere except where NP-hardness results are known), or the fastest perfect sampler known to date. Remarkably, we are able to get the first perfect sampler for perfect matchings of bipartite graphs based on the celebrated Jerrum-Sinclair-Vigoda algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the virtual degrees introduced by Larsen and Shalev. This leads to improved bounds on characters of symmetric groups. We then sharpen bounds of Liebeck and Shalev concerning the Witten zeta function. Our main application is a characterization of the fixed-point free conjugacy classes whose associated random walk mixes in 2 steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Caffarelli's contraction theorem bounds the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-convex measure and a strongly log-concave measure. We show that an analogous phenomenon holds on the level of the trace: The trace of the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-subharmonic measure and a strongly log-concave measure is bounded. We show that this trace bound has a number of consequences pertaining to volume-contracting transport maps, majorization and its monotonicity along Wasserstein geodesics, growth estimates of log-subharmonic functions, the Wehrl conjecture for Glauber states, and two-dimensional Coulomb gases. We also discuss volume-contraction properties for the Kim-Milman transport map</description>
