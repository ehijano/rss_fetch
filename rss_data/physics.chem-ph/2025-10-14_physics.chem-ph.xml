      <title>Detailed Kinetic Model for Combustion of NH3/H2 Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia is a promising zero-carbon fuel for industrial and transport applications, but its combustion is hindered by flame instabilities, incomplete oxidation, and the formation of nitrogen oxides. Accurate and detailed kinetic models are critical for designing optimal burners and engines. Despite numerous mechanisms published in recent years, large discrepancies remain between model predictions and experimental data, particularly for NOx species. In this work, we have reviewed the literature to obtain the most up-to-date and reliable thermochemical and kinetic parameters for most reactions present in ammonia combustion, and for reactions for which these parameters are not available, we performed high-level calculations to determine them. The purpose of this was to minimize the number of estimated parameters used in model development. A new, detailed kinetic mechanism was then generated with the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG). To ensure physical consistency, geometry optimizations were carried out for all hypothesized 'edge' species, and any non-convergent or non-physical structures were excluded. The resulting mechanism was tested against experimental laminar burning velocities, ignition delay time, flow reactor species profiles, and jet-stirred reactor data, and compared with five recent representative mechanisms. Recently developed bath-gas-mixture rules were applied to a number of key reactions in the mechanism, and we found this to result in better agreement with experiment for a number of modeling targets. While the mechanism does not reproduce all experimental results, it demonstrates improved robustness without parameter tuning, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting and enhancing predictive reliability under conditions relevant to practical applications.</description>

      <title>QCell: Comprehensive Quantum-Mechanical Dataset Spanning Diverse Biomolecular Fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are revolutionizing molecular simulations by bridging the gap between quantum-mechanical (QM) accuracy and the computational efficiency of mechanistic potentials. However, the development of reliable MLFFs for biomolecular systems remains constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, chemically diverse QM datasets that span all of the major classes of biomolecules expressed in living cells. Crucially, such a comprehensive dataset must be computed using non-empirical or minimally empirical approximations to solving the Schr\"odinger equation. To address these limitations, we introduce the QCell dataset -- a curated collection of 525k new QM calculations for biomolecular fragments encompassing carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, dimers, and ion clusters. QCell complements existing datasets, bringing the total number of available data points to 41 million molecular systems, all calculated using hybrid density functional theory with nonlocal many-body dispersion interactions, as captured by the PBE0+MBD(-NL) level of quantum mechanics. The QCell dataset therefore provides a valuable resource for training next-generation MLFFs capable of modeling the intricate interactions that govern biomolecular dynamics beyond small molecules and proteins.</description>

      <title>Real-time dynamics with bead-Fourier path integrals. II. Bead-Fourier RPMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman path integrals (PIs) have found many uses in approximate quantum dynamics methods that are able to efficiently calculate real-time quantum correlation functions. The PIs typically take the form of discrete imaginary time slices over a closed path, where the slices form the ``beads'' of a ring polymer (RP) necklace. Some methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), use the RP to generate an effective potential for the dynamics, while others, like RP molecular dynamics (RPMD), directly utilize the RP in real-time dynamics in order to incorporate quantum effects. The standard, discretized bead forms of CMD and RPMD can require a large number of RP beads to provide accurate results for systems where quantum effects are strong, such as at low temperatures. In Paper I, we introduced the bead-Fourier (BF) CMD method, where we utilized the inclusion of a Fourier sine series to reduce the number of beads needed to converge the CMD effective potential up to eightfold. In this work, we extend RPMD to incorporate BF-PIs in the form of BF-RPMD. We study a number of different implementations of the method through the calculation of correlation functions for both linear and non-linear operators. The effectiveness of the BF-RPMD method is sensitive to both the system and form of the operators being studied, but we show that this method is able to produce results on par with standard RPMD, with at worst twofold and up to eightfold reduction in the number of beads by including two to three Fourier components.</description>

      <title>Harvesting chemical power from cyclic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life relies on a sophisticated metabolic molecular machinery that turns over high-energy molecules to evolve complex macromolecules and assemblies. At the molecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for simple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment and perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms involved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive chemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we propose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system subject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of solvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a chemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant cycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We identify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for different molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around ten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in catalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life.</description>

      <title>Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Circular Dichroism of an Open-Shell Organometallic Camphor Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of one-photon valence-shell photoelectron spectroscopy and photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) for the chiral molecule (1R,4R)-3-(heptafluorobutyryl)-(+)-camphor (HFC) and its europium complex Eu(III) tris[3-(heptafluorobutyryl)-(1R,4R)-camphorate] (Eu-HFC$_{3}$), the latter of which constitutes the heaviest organometallic molecule for which PECD has yet been measured. We discuss the role of keto-enol tautomerism in HFC, both as a free molecule and complexed in Eu-HFC$_{3}$. PECD is a uniquely sensitive probe of molecular chirality and structure such as absolute configuration, conformation, isomerisation, and substitution, and as such is in principle well suited to unambiguously resolving tautomers; however modeling remains challenging. For small organic molecules, theory is generally capable of accounting for experimentally measured PECD asymmetries, but significantly poorer agreement is typically achieved for the case of large open-shell systems. Here, we report PECD asymmetries ranging up to $\sim8\%$ for HFC and $\sim7\%$ for Eu-HFC$_{3}$, of similar magnitude to those reported previously for smaller isolated chiral molecules, indicating that PECD remains a practical experimental technique for the study of large, complicated chiral systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first, sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG MLPs.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Monte Carlo Method for Polariton Chemistry via Mixed Block Sparsity and Tensor Hypercontraction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.</description>

      <title>Marcus Theory and The Condon Approximation Revisited II: The Horror of Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the applicability of the Condon approximation (i.e. the notion that the diabatic coupling is invariant to geometry) in the context of both electron transfer (ET) and triplet energy transfer (TET) and compare the two cases. Although it is well appreciated that diabatic couplings usually arise from the interactions of electronic wavefunction tails, we show that ET tails are very different from TET tails. Using a simple model problem, our analysis explains in detail why the rates of TET decays with twice the rate of ET, while also leading to the hypothesis that the smaller diabatic couplings found for TET (versus ET) should imply more sensitivity to non-Condon fluctuations. As an example, for the classic sets of molecules investigated by Closs, we show that the Condon approximation is indeed less applicable for TET than for ET.</description>

      <title>The survival of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aromaticity is a common chemical functionalities in bioactive molecules. In interstellar and circumstellar environments benzene and other small aromatics are considered the precursor for more complex prebiotic molecules and they have shown to potentially have rich ice-phase photochemistry. The availability of small organic molecules in prebiotic networks depends on their photostability in astrophysical environments preceding planet formation, particularly during the protoplanetary disk stage, as the disk composition is linked to the chemical make-up of planets and planetesimals. We study the ultraviolet (UV) photodestruction (120-160 nm) of five aromatic molecules in undiluted ices and, for selected cases, in astrophysically relevant ice matrices (H2O, CO, CO2). For each ice, we measure the destruction cross sections as a function of photon exposure. In undiluted ices, aromatic molecules exhibit substantially lower photodestruction cross sections (sigma &lt; 10-19 cm2) than aliphatic hydrocarbons, including cyclohexane, (sigma = 2.8-4x10-18 cm2). Furthermore, neither substituent nature nor size affects the aromatic stability in pure ices, suggesting that the strong intermolecular interactions among aromatic molecules provide protection against VUV exposure, even with small to mid-sized ring substituents. In mixed ices, the photodestruction and reactivity of aromatic molecules (sigma = 2.5-6.1x10-18 cm2) increases by more than an order of magnitude, but are still lower than in the gas-phase. We attribute this to a weaker cage effect and matrix-specific interactions. We use the experimental photodestruction cross sections to estimate the lifetime of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks, denileating the disks regions in which aromatic photochemistry is expected to be the most active.</description>

      <title>Ambient-Stable Transfer-Free Graphdiyne Wafers with Superhigh Hole Mobility at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphdiyne (GDY) is recognized as a compelling candidate for the fabrication of next-generation high-speed low-energy electronic devices due to its inherent p-type semiconductor characteristics. However, the development of GDY for applications in field-effect transistors (FETs), complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), and logic devices remains constrained by the relatively low carrier mobility reported in current experimental studies. Herein, the synthesis of layer-controlled hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) films directly on silicon substrates under a supercritical CO2 atmosphere is reported, along with the fabrication of these films into HsGDY-based FETs. The transfer-free growth strategy eliminates performance degradation caused by post-synthesis transfer processes. The resulting HsGDY FETs exhibit a remarkable hole mobility of up to 3800 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room-temperature, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of most p-type semiconductors. The synthesis of transfer-free HsGDY wafers provides a new strategy for resolving the carrier mobility mismatch between p-channel and n-channel two-dimensional metal-oxide-semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Exact Unitary Transformations for Many-body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact unitary transformations play a central role in the analysis and simulation of many-body quantum systems, yet the conditions under which they can be carried out exactly and efficiently remain incompletely understood. We show that exact transformations arise whenever the adjoint action of a unitary's generator defines a linear map within a finite-dimensional operator space. In this regime, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem ensures the existence of a finite-degree polynomial that annihilates the adjoint map, rendering the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion finite. This perspective brings together previously disparate examples of exact transformations under a single unifying principle and clarifies how algebraic relations between generators and transformed operators determine the polynomial degree of the transformation. We illustrate this framework for unitary coupled-cluster and involutory generators, identifying cases in which a single commutator suffices. The result establishes clear algebraic criteria for when exact unitary transformations are possible and provides new strategies for reducing their computational cost in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo approach to bound Trotter error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trotter product formulas are a natural and powerful approach to perform quantum simulation. However, the error analysis of product formulas is challenging, and their cost is often overestimated. It is established that Trotter error can be bounded in terms of spectral norms of nested commutators of the Hamiltonian partitions [Childs et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011020], but evaluating these expressions is challenging, often achieved by repeated application of the triangle inequality, significantly loosening the bound. Here, we show that the spectral norm of an operator can be upper bounded by the spectral norm of an equivalent sign-problem-free operator, which can be calculated efficiently to large system sizes using projector Monte Carlo simulation. For a range of Hamiltonians and considering second-order formulas, we demonstrate that this Monte Carlo-based bound is often extremely tight, and even exact in some instances. For the uniform electron gas we reduce the cost of performing Trotterization from the literature by an order of magnitude. For the Pariser-Parr-Pople model for linear acene molecules, which has $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ long-range interaction terms, we show that it suffices to use $\mathcal{O}(N^{0.57})$ Trotter steps and circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.57})$ to implement Hamiltonian simulation. We hope that this approach will lead to a better understanding of the potential accuracy of Trotterization in a range of important applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a practical, ab initio time-dependent method using Hagedorn wavepackets to efficiently simulate single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66-dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. The Hagedorn approach captures both mode distortion (frequency changes) and mode mixing (Duschinsky rotation) within the harmonic approximation. We not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^1$ and $\overline{11}^1$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. Notably, all spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for the emission spectrum from the ground vibrational level of the electronically excited state.</description>

      <title>Capturing anharmonic effects in single vibronic level fluorescence spectra using local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>

Abstract: Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics yields exact single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra in global harmonic models. To partially describe the effects of anharmonicity, important in the spectra of real molecules, we describe a combination of the Hagedorn wavepacket approach to SVL spectroscopy with the local harmonic approximation. In a proof-of-principle study [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010801 (2025)], we successfully demonstrated the utility of this method by computing the SVL spectra of difluorocarbene, a floppy molecule with moderately anharmonic potential. Here, we describe the theory in detail and analyse the method more thoroughly. To assess the accuracy of the method independently of electronic structure errors, we use a two-dimensional Morse-type potential for which exact quantum benchmarks are available, and show that the local harmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic approximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial vibrational levels. Next, we compare the global and local harmonic SVL spectra of anthracene, where the more expensive local harmonic corrections turn out to be less important as long as the correct global harmonic model is used. We also present additional local harmonic results for difluorocarbene, where treating anharmonicity is essential for accurate evaluation of the spectra. Yet, we also show that the structure of the difluorocarbene spectra can be explained qualitatively (but not quantitatively) with a reduced-dimensional harmonic model, for which the spectral intensities can be evaluated analytically.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>

Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Construction of Compact Primitive Gaussian Density Fitting Basis Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present model-assisted density fitting (MADF) basis set generator, an algorithm for generating primitive atomic Gaussian density fitting (DF) basis sets (DFBSs) from a contracted Gaussian orbital basis set (OBS). The MADF algorithm produces DFBSs suitable for accurate robust DF approximation of 2-particle interactions in mean-field and correlated electronic structure. The algorithm is designed to (a) saturate the OBS product space by a large regularized set of primitive solid-harmonic Gaussian shells with nonuniform distribution of exponents followed by (b) pruning of the shells according to their contributions to the 2-body energy of a correlated atomic ensemble. Building the DFBS generator model almost exclusively on mathematical and physical principles allows one to limit the number of parameters that control the density fitting error to three, with a single set of parameters sufficient for computations with all basis cardinal numbers, with and without correlation of core electrons, with and without scalar and spin-dependent relativistic effects, spanning almost all of the Periodic Table. Performance assessment included basis sets up to quadruple-zeta quality from several major basis set families, using molecules composed of main-group, d-block, and f-block elements. The resulting DF errors in Hartree-Fock and second-order MP2 energies (with relativistic all-electron treatments, when appropriate) were on the order of 20 and 10 microhartree per electron, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Measurement Problem: A Review of Recent Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Left on its own, a quantum state evolves deterministically under the Schr\"odinger Equation, forming superpositions. Upon measurement, however, a stochastic process governed by the Born rule collapses it to a single outcome. This dual evolution of quantum states -- the core of the Measurement Problem -- has puzzled physicists and philosophers for nearly a century. Yet, amid the cacophony of competing interpretations, the problem today is not as impenetrable as it once seemed. This paper reviews the current status of the Measurement Problem, distinguishing between what is well understood and what remains unresolved. We examine key theoretical approaches, including decoherence, many-worlds interpretation, objective collapse theories, hidden-variable theories, dualistic approaches, deterministic models, and epistemic interpretations. To make these discussions accessible to a broader audience, we also reference curated online resources that provide high-quality introductions to central concepts.</description>

      <title>Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</description>
