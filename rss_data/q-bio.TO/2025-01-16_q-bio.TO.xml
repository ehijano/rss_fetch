      <title>Practical parameter identifiability of respiratory mechanics in the extremely preterm infant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of mathematical models describing respiratory mechanics has grown in recent years, however, parameter identifiability of such models has only been studied in the last decade in the context of observable data. This study investigates parameter identifiability of a nonlinear respiratory mechanics model tuned to the physiology of an extremely preterm infant, using global Morris screening, local deterministic sensitivity analysis, and singular value decomposition-based subset selection. The model predicts airflow and dynamic pulmonary volumes and pressures under varying levels of continuous positive airway pressure, and a range of parameters characterizing both surfactant-treated and surfactant-deficient lung. Sensitivity analyses indicated eleven parameters influence model outputs over the range of continuous positive airway pressure and lung health scenarios. The model was adapted to data from a spontaneously breathing 1 kg infant using gradient-based optimization to estimate the parameter subset characterizing the patient's state of health.</description>

      <title>Female and Combined Male-Female Injury Risk Functions for the Anterior Pelvis Under Frontal Lap Belt Loading Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Iliac wing fractures due to lap belt loading have been observed in laboratory settings for 50 years and recent data suggest they are also occurring in the field. Automated driving systems (ADS) and other occupant compartment advancements are expected to offer enhanced flexibility in seating orientation, which could place a greater reliance on the seatbelt to restrain occupants. Such changes may increase seatbelt loads and create new challenges in successfully restraining occupants and mitigating injury to areas such as the pelvis. Injury criteria exist for component-level male iliac wing fractures resulting from frontal lap belt loading, but not for females. Methods: This study explored female iliac wing fracture tolerance in the same loading environment as a previous study that explored the fracture tolerance of isolated male iliac wings. Male and female fracture data were combined to evaluate the effect of sex. Injury risk functions were created by fitting Weibull survival models to data that integrated censored and exact failure observations. Results: Twenty female iliac wings were tested; fourteen of them sustained fracture with known failure forces (exact), but the remaining six wings either (1) did not fracture, or (2) fractured after an event that changed the boundary conditions (right censored). The fracture tolerance of the tested specimens ranged widely (1134 - 8759 N) and averaged 4240 N (SD 2516 N). Conclusion: Female data and combined male-female data were analyzed. Age was the only covariate investigated in this study that had a statistically significant effect and improved the predictive performance of the models.</description>

      <title>Neuroblastoma: nutritional strategies as supportive care in pediatric oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroblastoma, is a highly heterogeneous pediatric tumour and is responsible for 15% of pediatric cancer-related deaths. The clinical outcomes can vary from spontaneous regression to high metastatic disease. This extracranial tumour arises from a neural crest-derived cell and can harbor different phenotypes. Its heterogeneity may result from variations in differentiation states influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors and individual patient characteristics. This leads downstream to disruption of homeostasis and a metabolic shift in response to the tumour needs. Nutrition can play a key role in influencing various aspects of a tumour behaviour. This review provides an in-depth exploration of the aetiology of neuroblastoma and the different avenues of disease progression, which can be targeted with individualized nutrition intervention strategies to improve the well-being of children and optimize clinical outcomes.</description>
