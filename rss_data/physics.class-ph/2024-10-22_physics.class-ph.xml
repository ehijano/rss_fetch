      <title>Local Field Statistics in Linear Elastic Unidirectional Fibrous Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical fluctuations of local tensorial fields beyond the mean are relevant to predict localized failure or overall behavior of the inelastic composites. The expression for second moments of the local fields can be established using Hill-Mandel condition. Complete estimation of statistical fluctuations via second moments is usually ignored despite its significance. In Eshelby-based mean-field approaches, the second moments are evaluated through derivatives of Hill's Polarization tensor $ \left ( \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}} \right )$ using a singular approximation. Typically, semi-analytical procedures using numerical integration are used to evaluate the derivatives of the polarization tensor $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}}$. Here, new analytically derived explicit expressions are presented for calculating the derivatives, specifically for unidirectional fibrous composites with isotropic phases. Full-field homogenization using finite element is used to compute the statistical distribution of local fields (exact solution) for the class of random fibrous microstructures. The mean-field estimates are validated with the exact solution across different fiber volume fractions and aspect ratios. The results indicate that the fiber volume fraction significantly influences the fluctuation of stress tensor invariants, whereas the aspect ratio has minimal effect.</description>

      <title>Pair Space in Classical Mechanics II. N-Body Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A previous work introduced pair space, which is spanned by the center of mass of a system and the relative positions (pair positions) of its constituent bodies. Here, I show that in the $N$-body Newtonian problem, a configuration that does not remain on a fixed line in space is a central configuration if and only if it conserves all pair angular momenta. For collinear systems, I obtain a set of equations for the ratios of the relative distances of the bodies, from which I derive some bounds on the minimal length of the line. For the non-collinear case I derive some geometrical relations, independent of the masses of the bodies. These are necessary conditions for a non-collinear configuration to be central. They generalize, to arbitrary $N$, a consequence of the Dziobek relation, which holds for $N=4$.</description>

      <title>An analytical model of tornado generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new analytical model for the generation of axisymmetric tornado-type vortices has been developed. A solution to the nonlinear equation for the stream function in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The solution is sought by smooth connecting continuous solutions for the internal region ("eye"), the central region ("wall" with maximum velocities) and the external region of the tornado. Expressions describing radial dependences for the radial and vertical velocity components include combinations of Bessel functions. The vortex is spatially localized by radius and height. Convective instability of a stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical components of velocities according to the hyperbolic sine law. A downward flow is observed near the tornado axis. The maximum speed of the upward flow is achieved at a certain radial distance at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the central part of the tornado, and above this height there is an outflow from the "wall" to the axis and to the periphery. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial disturbance and can change with height. Maximum rotation is achieved in the tornado "wall" at a certain height. The increase in azimuthal velocity can occur according to a superexponential law. Possible structures of movements, scenarios for the development of a tornado and its dynamics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>
