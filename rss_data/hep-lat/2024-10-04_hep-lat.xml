      <title>Confinement-Higgs and deconfinement-Higgs transitions in three-dimensional $Z(2)$ LGT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the three-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory (LGT) with $Z(2)$ gauge fields coupled to $Z(2)$-valued Higgs fields. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases. The latter operator is an analog of the overlap Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin-glasses. According to it, the Higgs phase is realized as a glassy phase of the gauge system. For this reason standard tricks for simulations of spin-glass phases are utilized in this work, namely tempered Monte Carlo and averaging over replicas. In addition, we also present results for a certain definition of distance between Higgs field configurations. Finally, we calculate various gauge-invariant correlation functions in order to extract the corresponding masses.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional QCD at finite density and its 't Hooft-Veneziano limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact solution of one-dimensional lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential is reviewed for the gauge groups $G=Z(N),U(N),SU(N)$ for all values of $N$ and the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Calculated are the partition function, free energy, the Polyakov loop expectation values, baryon density, quark condensate, meson and baryon correlation functions. Detailed analysis of the exact solutions is done for $N=2,3$ with one and two fermion flavors. In the large $N_f$ limit we uncover the Roberge-Weiss phase transition and discuss its remnants at finite $N_f$. In the case of $N_f$ degenerate flavors we also calculate 1) the large $N$ limit, 2) the large $N_f$ limit and 3) the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit of all models. The critical behavior of the models in these limits is studied and the phase structure is described in details. A comparison of all limits with $U(3)$ and $SU(3)$ QCD is also performed. In order to achieve these results we explore several representations of the partition function of one-dimensional QCD obtained and described in the text.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of glueballs in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents preliminary results of the first determination of the energy-momentum tensor form factors of the scalar glueball, referred to as gravitational form factors (GFFs). The calculation has been carried out in lattice Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing. Using variationally optimized operators, the matrix elements are extracted from ratios of three-point functions to two-point functions. The glueball GFFs and their kinematic dependence are compared to those of other hadrons from previous calculations.</description>

      <title>NETS: A Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Looking for WIMPs through the neutrino fogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the expected sensitivity of large-scale xenon detectors to Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Assuming current primary noise sources can be mitigated, we find that with the present discrimination power between nuclear and electron recoils, the experimental sensitivity is limited not only by atmospheric neutrinos' nuclear recoils (''nuclear recoil neutrino fog'') but also by solar neutrinos' electron-recoil events (''electron recoil neutrino fog''). While this is known by experimentalists, it is often missed or misunderstood by theorists, and we therefore emphasize this effect. We set up a realistic detector simulation to quantify the contamination of the WIMP signal from both these neutrino backgrounds. We observe that the electron-recoil background remains significant even for signal rates exceeding those of atmospheric neutrinos, as predicted by most electroweak WIMP candidates. We update the projections for the required exposure to exclude/discover a given electroweak WIMP, streamlining the computation of their signal rates and uncertainties. We show that all of the real WIMPs with zero hypercharge can be excluded (discovered) with a 50 tonne year (300 tonne year) exposure. A similar exposure will allow to probe a large portion of the viable parameter space for complex WIMP with non-zero hypercharge.</description>

      <title>Machine learning a fixed point action for SU(3) gauge theory with a gauge equivariant convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed point lattice actions are designed to have continuum classical properties unaffected by discretization effects and reduced lattice artifacts at the quantum level. They provide a possible way to extract continuum physics with coarser lattices, thereby allowing one to circumvent problems with critical slowing down and topological freezing toward the continuum limit. A crucial ingredient for practical applications is to find an accurate and compact parametrization of a fixed point action, since many of its properties are only implicitly defined. Here we use machine learning methods to revisit the question of how to parametrize fixed point actions. In particular, we obtain a fixed point action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using convolutional neural networks with exact gauge invariance. The large operator space allows us to find superior parametrizations compared to previous studies, a necessary first step for future Monte Carlo simulations and scaling studies.</description>

      <title>Extreme softening of QCD phase transition under weak acceleration: first principle Monte Carlo results for gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 27$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Generalized HMC using Nambu mechanics for lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I describe a generalization of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm in which the molecular dynamics (MD) steps utilize Nambu generalized Hamiltonian dynamics. Characterized by multiple Hamiltonian functions, this formalism allows me to include forces from non-local objects in the MD evolution while preserving the target probability distribution. In this way, the changes proposed by the MD at one location can be made using instantaneous knowledge of the long-distance behavior of the gauge field to a degree beyond that usually provided by the fermion determinant. This represents a promising method for reducing critical slowing down in lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goto string as a higher-derivative Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. An equivalence with the four-derivative action suggests that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions can be described by the (4,3) minimal model analogously to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>
