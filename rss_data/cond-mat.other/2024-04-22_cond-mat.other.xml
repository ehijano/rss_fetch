      <title>A Griffith description of fracture for non-monotonic loading with application to fatigue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the fundamental objective of establishing the universality of the Griffith energy competition to describe the growth of large cracks in solids \emph{not} just under monotonic but under general loading conditions, this paper puts forth a generalization of the classical Griffith energy competition in nominally elastic brittle materials to arbitrary \emph{non-monotonic} quasistatic loading conditions, which include monotonic and cyclic loadings as special cases. Centered around experimental observations, the idea consists in: $i$) viewing the critical energy release rate $\mathcal{G}_c$ \emph{not} as a material constant but rather as a material function of both space $\textbf{X}$ and time $t$, $ii$) one that decreases in value as the loading progresses, this solely within a small region $\Omega_\ell(t)$ around crack fronts, with the characteristic size $\ell$ of such a region being material specific, and $iii$) with the decrease in value of $\mathcal{G}_c$ being dependent on the history of the elastic fields in $\Omega_\ell(t)$. By construction, the proposed Griffith formulation is able to describe any Paris-law behavior of the growth of large cracks in nominally elastic brittle materials for the limiting case when the loading is cyclic. For the opposite limiting case when the loading is monotonic, the formulation reduces to the classical Griffith formulation. Additional properties of the proposed formulation are illustrated via a parametric analysis and direct comparisons with representative fatigue fracture experiments on a ceramic, mortar, and PMMA.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Long-Distance Coherence in Critically-Driven Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing quantum networks necessitates coherently connecting distant systems via remote strong coupling. Here, we demonstrate long-distance coherence in cavity magnonics operating in the linear regime. By locally setting the cavity near critical coupling with travelling photons, non-local magnon-photon coherence is established via strong coupling over a 2-meter distance. We observe two anomalies in this long-distance coherence: first, the coupling strength oscillates twice the period of conventional photon-mediated couplings; second, clear mode splitting is observed within the cavity linewidth. Both effects cannot be explained by conventional coupled-mode theory, which reveal the tip of an iceberg of photon-mediated coupling in systems under critical driving. Our work shows the potential of using critical phenomena for harnessing long-distance coherence in distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in AA homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor by a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>

      <title>Fully Tunable Fano Resonances in Chiral Electronic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fano resonance arises from interference between a direct path and a resonant path. Predictions and observations of Fano profiles of conductance have been reported yet only in nonchiral electron transport. We propose an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer(\textcolor{blue}{MZFI}) that integrates a quantum dot to an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer and investigate various transport spectra of this type of device. Electron motion in the device is chiral and backscattering is absent, enabling the transmission, linear conductance and differential spectra such as differential conductance, differential shot noise and differential Fano factor to possess perfect Fano profiles that can be fully tuned by an external magnetic flux. For a symmetric interferometer of(two arms with the same length, even the current and shot noise demonstrate fully tunable resonances and are bestowed different hallmarks unique to Fano resonances. All the transport spectra display the same evolution pattern in an evolution cycle, which along with the profiles are robust against variation of the parameters defining the device.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline chiral soliton lattices in a Fibonacci helimagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state magnetic configurations of a Fibonacci chain of classical spins with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions. Our analysis reveals a diverse array of magnetic textures induced by an external magnetic field perpendicular to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector. These textures exhibit a spectrum ranging from a quasi-fully polarized non-collinear state under high magnetic fields, capable of maintaining metastable chiral soliton topological defects, to a variety of quasicrystalline chiral soliton lattices below a critical field $H_c$. For a range of magnetic fields below $H_c$, the ground state spin textures result from the interplay between an effective quasiperiodic potential influencing the solitons and their repulsive interactions. At lower magnetic fields, the system experiences a commensurate-incommensurate transition, signified by the appearance of discommensurations in the quasicrystalline soliton lattice. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the ground state assumes a helical configuration with a quasiperiodic pitch angle.</description>

      <title>Vortex nonlinear optics in monolayer van der Waals crystals</title>

Abstract: In addition to wavelength and polarization, coherent light possesses a degree of freedom associated with its spatial topology that, when exploited through nonlinear optics, can unlock a plethora of new photonic phenomena. A prime example involves the use of vortex beams, which allow for the tuning of light's orbital angular momentum (OAM) on demand. Such processes can not only reveal emergent physics but also enable high-density classical and quantum communication paradigms by allowing access to an infinitely large set of orthogonal optical states. Nevertheless, structured nonlinear optics have failed to keep pace with the ever-present need to shrink the length-scale of optoelectronic and photonic technologies to the nanoscale regime. Here, we push the boundaries of vortex nonlinear optics to the ultimate limits of material dimensionality. By exploiting second and third-order nonlinear frequency-mixing processes in van der Waals semiconductor monolayers, we show the free manipulation of the wavelength, topological charge, and radial index of vortex light-fields. We demonstrate that such control can be supported over a broad spectral bandwidth, unconstrained by traditional limits associated with bulk nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, due to the atomically-thin nature of the host crystal. Our work breaks through traditional constraints in optics and promises to herald a new avenue for next-generation optoelectronic and photonics technologies empowered by twisted nanoscale nonlinear light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer graphene</title>

Abstract: Floquet engineering is a novel method of manipulating quantum phases of matter via periodic driving [1, 2]. It has successfully been utilized in different platforms ranging from photonic systems [3] to optical lattice of ultracold atoms [4, 5]. In solids, light can be used as the periodic drive via coherent light-matter interaction. This leads to hybridization of Bloch electrons with photons resulting in replica bands known as Floquet-Bloch states. After the direct observation of Floquet-Bloch states in a topological insulator [6], their manifestations have been seen in a number of other experiments [7-14]. By engineering the electronic band structure using Floquet-Bloch states, various exotic phase transitions have been predicted [15-22] to occur. To realize these phases, it is necessary to better understand the nature of Floquet-Bloch states in different materials. However, direct energy and momentum resolved observation of these states is still limited to only few material systems [6, 10, 14, 23, 24]. Here, we report direct observation of Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer epitaxial graphene which was the first proposed material platform [15] for Floquet engineering. By using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with mid-infrared (mid-IR) pump excitation, we detected replicas of the Dirac cone. Pump polarization dependence of these replica bands unequivocally shows that they originate from the scattering between Floquet-Bloch states and photon-dressed free-electron-like photoemission final states, called Volkov states. Beyond graphene, our method can potentially be used to directly observe Floquet-Bloch states in other systems paving the way for Floquet engineering in a wide range of quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: In the last few decades, interference has been extensively studied in both the quantum and classical fields, which reveals light volatility and is widely used for high-precision measurements. We have put forward the phenomenon in which the discrete diffraction and interference phenomena, presented by the time-varying voltage of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit model with an anti-PT (APT) symmetry. To demonstrate Young's double-slit phenomenon in an APT circuit, we initially explore the coupled mode theory (CMT) of voltage in the broken phase, observe discrete diffraction under single excitation and interference under double excitations. Furthermore, we design a phase-shifting circuit to observe the effects of phase difference and distance on discrete interference. Our work combines the effects in optics with condensed matter physics, show the Young's double-slit phenomenon in electrical circuits theoretically and experimentally.</description>

      <title>Perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination -- how far is the radiative limit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report an experimental demonstration of perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination and critically analyse their performance against radiative limits. To this end, we first establish a set of quantitative benchmark characteristics expected from solar cells limited by bimolecular recombination. Transient as well as steady state intensity dependent measurements indicate that our solar cells indeed operate at such limits with interface passivation comparable to the champion c-Si technology. Further, we identify novel characterization schemes which enable consistent back extraction of recombination parameters from transient optoelectrical and electroluminescence measurements. Remarkably, these parameters predict important features of dark current density vs. voltage characteristics (J-V) and Suns-V_OC measurements, thus validating the estimates and the methodology. Uniquely, this work provides a consistent and coherent interpretation of diverse experimental trends ranging from dark J-V, Suns-V_OC, steady state and transient intensity dependent measurements to electroluminescence quantum yield. As such, insights shared in this manuscript could have significant implications towards fundamental electronic processes in perovskite solar cells and further efficiency optimization towards Shockley-Queisser limits.</description>
