      <title>Simulation and Data Assimilation in an Idealized Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Sea Ice Floe Model with Cloud Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice plays a crucial role in the climate system, particularly in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), a transitional area consisting of fragmented ice between the open ocean and consolidated pack ice. As the MIZ expands, understanding its dynamics becomes essential for predicting climate change impacts. However, the role of clouds in these processes has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses that gap by developing an idealized coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice model incorporating cloud and precipitation effects, tackling both forward (simulation) and inverse (data assimilation) problems. Sea ice dynamics are modeled using the discrete element method, which simulates floes driven by atmospheric and oceanic forces. The ocean is represented by a two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, capturing mesoscale eddies and ice-ocean drag. The atmosphere is modeled using a two-layer saturated precipitating QG system, accounting for variable evaporation over sea surfaces and ice. Cloud cover affects radiation, influencing ice melting. The idealized coupled modeling framework allows us to study the interactions between atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice floes. Specifically, it focuses on how clouds and precipitation affect energy balance, melting, and freezing processes. It also serves as a testbed for data assimilation, which allows the recovery of unobserved floe trajectories and ocean fields in cloud-induced uncertainties. Numerical results show that appropriate reduced-order models help improve data assimilation efficiency with partial observations, allowing the skillful inference of missing floe trajectories and lower atmospheric winds. These results imply the potential of integrating idealized models with data assimilation to improve our understanding of Arctic dynamics and predictions.</description>

      <title>Full-waveform earthquake source inversion using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for full-waveform seismic source inversion using simulation-based inference (SBI). Traditional probabilistic approaches often rely on simplifying assumptions about data errors, which we show can lead to inaccurate uncertainty quantification. SBI addresses this limitation by building an empirical probabilistic model of the data errors using machine learning models, known as neural density estimators, which can then be integrated into the Bayesian inference framework. We apply the SBI framework to point-source moment tensor inversions as well as joint moment tensor and time-location inversions. We construct a range of synthetic examples to explore the quality of the SBI solutions, as well as to compare the SBI results with standard Gaussian likelihood-based Bayesian inversions. We then demonstrate that under real seismic noise, common Gaussian likelihood assumptions for treating full-waveform data yield overconfident posterior distributions that underestimate the moment tensor component uncertainties by up to a factor of 3. We contrast this with SBI, which produces well-calibrated posteriors that generally agree with the true seismic source parameters, and offers an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of simulations required to perform inference compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques. Finally, we apply our methodology to a pair of moderate magnitude earthquakes in the North Atlantic. We utilise seismic waveforms recorded by the recent UPFLOW ocean bottom seismometer array as well as by regional land stations in the Azores, comparing full moment tensor and source-time location posteriors between SBI and a Gaussian likelihood approach. We find that our adaptation of SBI can be directly applied to real earthquake sources to efficiently produce high quality posterior distributions that significantly improve upon Gaussian likelihood approaches.</description>

      <title>Reactivity of chondritic meteorites under H2-rich atmospheres: Formation of H2S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current models of chemical evolution during star and planetary formation rely on the presence of dust grains to act as a third body. However, they generally ignore the reactivity of the dust grains themselves. Dust grains present in the protoplanetary phase will evolve as the solar system forms and, after protoplanets have appeared, they will be constantly delivered to their surfaces in the form of large aggregates or meteorites. Chondritic meteorites are mostly unaltered samples of the dust present in the first stages of the Solar System formation, that still arrive nowadays to the surface of Earth and allow us to study the properties of the materials forming the early Solar System. These materials contain, amongst others, transition metals that can potentially act as catalysts, as well as other phases that can potentially react in different astrophysical conditions, such as FeS. In this work, we present the reactivity of chondritic meteorites under \hydrogen-rich atmospheres, particularly towards the reduction of FeS for the formation of H2S and metallic Fe during the early phases of the planetary formation. We present the obtained results on the reaction rates and the percentage of FeS available to react in the materials. Additionally, we include a computational study of the reaction mechanism and the energetics. Finally, we discuss the implications of an early formation of H2S in planetary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Shedding a Light on the Kinetics of the Carboxysulfitic Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way in which we can attempt to relate chemical pathways to geochemical environments is by studying the kinetics of a given sequence of reactions and identifying the conditions under which this chemistry is the most productive. Many prebiotic reactions rely on a source of fixed carbon, therefore chemical pathways that suggest prebiotically plausible ways of fixing carbon are of significant interest. One such pathway is the carboxysulfitic reaction network which uses solvated electrons, produced as a result of electron photodetachment from sulfite, to reduce carbon. In this work we explore carboxysulfitic chemistry at three different pH values: 6, 9, and 12. We utilise a new light source, that matches the broadband spectral shape of the young Sun, to irradiate a mixture of bicarbonate and sulfite. We determine the rate equation for the production of formate from these compounds and find the order to be 0.71 $\pm$ 0.12 with respect to bicarbonate and -0.60 $\pm$ 0.10 with respect to sulfite. Following this, we determine rate constants for the production of formate considering two different mechanisms. We find this chemistry to be feasible at all three of the pH values tested, with the magnitude of the rate constants being highly dependent on the assumed mechanism. We suggest that these results may have implications for Mars Sample Return owing to Jezero Crater having had lakes similar to those in which we propose carboxysulfitic chemistry to have been the most productive. Due to Mars' relatively unaltered surface, we propose that Mars Sample Return missions could look for preserved tracers of this chemistry, shedding light on Mars' past conditions and its potential for having hosted life.</description>
