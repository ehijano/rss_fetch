      <title>Finite State Dimension and The Davenport Erd\H{o}s Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1952 result of Davenport and Erd\H{o}s states that if $p$ is an integer-valued polynomial, then the real number $0.p(1)p(2)p(3)\dots$ is Borel normal in base ten. A later result of Nakai and Shiokawa extends this result to polynomials with arbitrary real coefficients and all bases $b\geq 2$. It is well-known that finite-state dimension, a finite-state effectivization of the classical Hausdorff dimension, characterizes the Borel normal sequences as precisely those sequences of finite-state dimension 1. For an infinite set of natural numbers, and a base $b\geq 2$, the base $b$ Copeland-Erd\H{o}s sequence of $A$, $CE_b(A)$, is the infinite sequence obtained by concatenating the base $b$ expressions of the numbers in $A$ in increasing order. In this work we investigate the possible relationships between the finite-state dimensions of $CE_b(A)$ and $CE_b(p(A))$ where $p$ is a polynomial. We show that, if the polynomial is permitted to have arbitrary real coefficients, then for any $s,s^\prime$ in the unit interval, there is a set $A$ of natural numbers and a linear polynomial $p$ so that the finite-state dimensions of $CE_b(A)$ and $CE_b(p(A))$ are $s$ and $s^\prime$ respectively. We also demonstrate that linear polynomials with rational coefficients do not change the finite-state dimension of any Copeland-Erd\H{o}s sequence, but there exist polynomials with rational coefficients of every larger integer degree that change the finite-state dimension of some sequence. To prove our main results, we develop techniques involving taking concatenated prefixes of a sequence as well as inserting a density zero set of strings into a sequence that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Computation Offloading in Multi-User Mobile Edge Computing with Decentralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows appliances to offload workloads to neighboring MEC servers that have the potential for computation-intensive tasks with limited computational capabilities. This paper studied how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are used in an MEC system to find feasible decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategies, which leads to the construction of an extensible MEC system that operates effectively with finite feedback. Even though the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, subject to their knowledge of the MEC system, can be used to allocate powers of both computation offloading and local execution, to learn a computation offloading policy for each user independently, we realized that this solution still has some inherent weaknesses. Hence, we introduced a new approach for this problem based on the Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm, which enables us to overcome this proneness and investigate cases where mobile users are portable. Numerical results showed that individual users can autonomously learn adequate policies through the proposed approach. Besides, the performance of the suggested solution exceeded the conventional DDPG-based power control strategy.</description>

      <title>Zero-Energy RIS-Assisted Communications With Noise Modulation and Interference-Based Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance towards carbon-neutrality and improve the limited {performance} of conventional passive wireless communications, in this paper, we investigate the integration of noise modulation with zero-energy reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In particular, the RIS reconfigurable elements (REs) are divided into two groups: one for beamforming the desired signals in reflection mode and another for harvesting energy from interference signals in an absorption mode, providing the power required for RIS operation. Since the harvested energy is a random variable, a random number of REs can beamform the signals, while the remainder blindly reflects them. We present a closed-form solution and a search algorithm for REs allocation, jointly optimizing both the energy harvesting (EH) and communication performance. Considering the repetition coding technique and discrete phase shifts, we derive analytical expressions for the energy constrained success rate, bit error rate, optimal threshold, mutual information, {and energy efficiency}. Numerical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm and expressions, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed integration over conventional noise-modulation systems. It is shown that by properly allocating the REs, both the EH and communication performance can be improved in low to moderate interference scenarios, while the latter is restricted in the high-interference regime.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization based on Two-phase GNN in RIS- and DF-assisted MISO Systems with Fine-grained Rate Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and half-duplex decoded and forwarded (DF) relays can collaborate to optimize wireless signal propagation in communication systems. Users typically have different rate demands and are clustered into groups in practice based on their requirements, where the former results in the trade-off between maximizing the rate and satisfying fine-grained rate demands, while the latter causes a trade-off between inter-group competition and intra-group cooperation when maximizing the sum rate. However, traditional approaches often overlook the joint optimization encompassing both of these trade-offs, disregarding potential optimal solutions and leaving some users even consistently at low date rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel joint optimization model for a RIS- and DF-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) system where a base station (BS) is with multiple antennas transmits data by multiple RISs and DF relays to serve grouped users with fine-grained rate demands. We design a new loss function to not only optimize the sum rate of all groups but also adjust the satisfaction ratio of fine-grained rate demands by modifying the penalty parameter. We further propose a two-phase graph neural network (GNN) based approach that inputs channel state information (CSI) to simultaneously and autonomously learn efficient phase shifts, beamforming, and relay selection. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves system performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaverse and Digital Twin (DT) have attracted much academic and industrial attraction to approach the future digital world. This paper introduces the advantages of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in assisting Metaverse system-based Digital Twin. In this system, we assume that it includes several Metaverse User devices collecting data from the real world to transfer it into the virtual world, a Metaverse Virtual Access Point (MVAP) undertaking the processing of data, and an edge computing server that receives the offloading data from the MVAP. The proposed model works under a dynamic environment with various parameters changing over time. The experiment results show that our proposed DRL algorithm is suitable for offloading tasks to ensure the promptness of DT in a dynamic environment.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated multi-RIS Communication: The Effect of Inter-Operator Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-operator wireless communication system is studied where each operator is equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance its communication quality. RISs controlled by different operators affect the system performance of one another due to the inherently rapid phase shift adjustments that occur on an independent basis. The system performance of such a communication scenario is analytically studied for the practical case where spatial correlation occurs at RIS of arbitrary size. The proposed framework is quite general since it is analyzed under Nakagami-$m$ channel fading conditions. Finally, the derived analytical results are verified via numerical and simulation trials as well as some new and useful engineering outcomes are revealed.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large-Scale Movable Antenna-Enabled Multiuser Communications: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has been recognized as a promising technology to improve communication performance in future wireless networks such as 6G. To unleash its potential, this paper proposes a novel architecture, namely extremely large-scale MA (XL-MA), which allows flexible antenna/subarray positioning over an extremely large spatial region for effectively enhancing near-field effects and spatial multiplexing performance. In particular, this paper studies an uplink XL-MA-enabled multiuser system, where single-antenna users distributed in a coverage area are served by a base station (BS) equipped with multiple movable subarrays. We begin by presenting a spatially non-stationary channel model to capture the near-field effects, including positiondependent large-scale channel gains and line-of-sight visibility. To evaluate system performance, we further derive a closedform approximation of the expected weighted sum rate under maximum ratio combining (MRC), revealing that optimizing XLMA placement enhances user channel power gain to increase desired signal power and reduces channel correlation to decreases multiuser interference. Building upon this, we formulate an antenna placement optimization problem to maximize the expected weighted sum rate, leveraging statistical channel conditions and user distribution. To efficiently solve this challenging non-linear binary optimization problem, we propose a polynomial-time successive replacement algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed XL-MA placement strategy achieves nearoptimal performance, significantly outperforming benchmark schemes based on conventional fixed-position antennas.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming for NOMA Assisted Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna system (PASS) configures the positions of pinching antennas (PAs) along dielectric waveguides to change both large-scale fading and small-scale scattering, which is known as pinching beamforming. A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted PASS framework is proposed for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. The transmit power minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and power allocation. To solve this highly nonconvex problem, both gradient-based and swarm-based optimization methods are developed. 1) For gradient-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed. The Lipschitz gradient surrogate function is constructed based on MM to tackle the nonconvex terms of this problem. Then, the joint optimization problem is decomposed into subproblems that are alternatively optimized based on PDD to obtain stationary closed-form solutions. 2) For swarm-based method, a fast-convergent particle swarm optimization and zero forcing (PSO-ZF) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the PA position-seeking particles are constructed to explore high-quality pinching beamforming solutions. Moreover, ZF-based transmit beamforming is utilized by each particle for fast fitness function evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed NOMA assisted PASS and algorithms outperforms the conventional NOMA assisted massive antenna system. The proposed framework reduces over 95.22% transmit power compared to conventional massive MIMO-NOMA systems. ii) Swarm-based optimization outperforms gradient-based optimization by searching effective solution subspace to avoid stuck in undesirable local optima.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization for Aerial Multi-access Edge Computing via Cooperation of UAVs and HAPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an extensive increment of computation demands, the aerial multi-access edge computing (MEC), mainly based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high altitude platforms (HAPs), plays significant roles in future network scenarios. In detail, UAVs can be flexibly deployed, while HAPs are characterized with large capacity and stability. Hence, in this paper, we provide a hierarchical model composed of an HAP and multi-UAVs, to provide aerial MEC services. Moreover, considering the errors of channel state information from unpredictable environmental conditions, we formulate the problem to minimize the total energy cost with the chance constraint, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem with uncertain parameters and intractable to solve. To tackle this issue, we optimize the UAV deployment via the weighted K-means algorithm. Then, the chance constraint is reformulated via the distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Furthermore, based on the conditional value-at-risk mechanism, we transform the DRO problem into a mixed-integer second order cone programming, which is further decomposed into two subproblems via the primal decomposition. Moreover, to alleviate the complexity of the binary subproblem, we design a binary whale optimization algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes by comparing with baseline mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Covert Communication Using Software-Defined Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental information-theoretic limits of covert, or low probability of detection (LPD), communication have been extensively studied for over a decade, resulting in the square root law (SRL): only $L\sqrt{n}$ covert bits can be reliably transmitted over time-bandwidth product $n$, for constant $L&gt;0$. Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The SRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of provably-secure covert communication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is underexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert communication are available, both focusing on optical channels. Here, we report our initial results demonstrating the provably-secure covert radio-frequency (RF) communication using software-defined radios (SDRs). These validate theoretical predictions, open practical avenues for implementing covert communication systems, as well as raise future research questions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Linear Best Feasible Arm Identification with Fixed Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability approaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple setting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address this gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We introduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that guarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay rate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the identification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations across various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Baseband-Free End-to-End Communication System Based on Diffractive Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), also referred to as reconfigurable intelligent metasurface based deep neural networks (Rb-DNNs) or stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) in the field of wireless communications, has emerged as a promising signal processing paradigm that enables computing-by-propagation. However, existing architectures are limited to implementing specific functions such as precoding and combining, while still relying on digital baseband modules for other essential tasks like modulation and detection. In this work, we propose a baseband-free end-to-end (BBF-E2E) wireless communication system where modulation, beamforming, and detection are jointly realized through the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves. The BBF-E2E system employs D2NNs at both the transmitter and the receiver, forming an autoencoder architecture optimized as a complex-valued neural network. The transmission coefficients of each metasurface layer are trained using the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method to minimize the cross-entropy loss. To reduce computational complexity during diffraction calculation, the angular spectrum method (ASM) is adopted in place of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formula. Extensive simulations demonstrate that BBF-E2E achieves robust symbol transmission under challenging channel conditions with significantly reduced hardware requirements. In particular, the proposed system matches the performance of a conventional multi-antenna system with 81 RF chains while requiring only a single RF chain and 1024 passive elements of metasurfaces. These results highlight the potential of wave-domain neural computing to replace digital baseband modules in future wireless transceivers.</description>

      <title>Adversarial quantum channel discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantum channel discrimination in an adversarial setting, where the tester plays against an adversary who accesses the environmental system and possesses internal quantum memory to perform adaptive strategies. We show that in asymmetric hypothesis testing, the optimal type-II error exponent is precisely characterized by the minimum output channel divergence, a new notion of quantum channel divergence in the worst-case scenario. This serves as a direct analog of the quantum Stein's lemma in the adversarial channel discrimination. Notably, the optimal error exponent can be achieved via simple non-adaptive strategies by the adversary, and its value can be efficiently computed despite its regularization. The strong converse property for quantum channel discrimination also holds in general. This adversarial quantum Stein's lemma is proved by new chain rules for measured and sandwiched relative entropies. Moreover, we derive a generalized version of the entropy accumulation theorem between two arbitrary sequences of quantum channels, extending the existing results from entropy to divergence and providing a solution to the dual formulation of the open problem presented in [IEEE FOCS, pp. 844-850 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Coded Many-User Multiple Access via Approximate Message Passing</title>

Abstract: We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. In this regime, schemes based on sparse superposition coding can achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. However, these schemes are feasible only for small values of user payload. This paper investigates efficient schemes for larger user payloads, focusing on coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize its tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results show that the decoder achieves state-of-the-art performance at finite lengths, with a coded CDMA scheme defined using LDPC codes and a spatially coupled matrix of signature sequences.</description>

      <title>Enabling 6G Performance in the Upper Mid-Band by Transitioning From Massive to Gigantic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial 6G networks will likely operate in the upper mid-band (7-24 GHz), which has decent propagation conditions but underwhelming new spectrum availability. In this paper, we explore whether we can anyway reach the ambitious 6G performance goals by evolving the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology from massive in 5G to gigantic in 6G. We describe how many antennas are needed to reach the envisioned 6G peak user rates, how many can realistically be deployed in practical radio equipment, and what the practical spatial degrees-of-freedom might become. We further suggest a new deployment strategy that enables the utilization of radiative near-field effects in these bands for precise beamfocusing, localization, and sensing from a single base station site. Finally, we identify open research and standardization challenges that must be overcome to efficiently use gigantic MIMO dimensions in 6G from hardware, cost, and algorithmic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Conditional Entropies of k-Deletion/Insertion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The channel output entropy of a transmitted sequence is the entropy of the possible channel outputs and similarly the channel input entropy of a received sequence is the entropy of all possible transmitted sequences. The goal of this work is to study these entropy values for the k-deletion, k-insertion channels, where exactly k symbols are deleted, inserted in the transmitted sequence, respectively. If all possible sequences are transmitted with the same probability then studying the input and output entropies is equivalent. For both the 1-deletion and 1-insertion channels, it is proved that among all sequences with a fixed number of runs, the input entropy is minimized for sequences with a skewed distribution of their run lengths and it is maximized for sequences with a balanced distribution of their run lengths. Among our results, we establish a conjecture by Atashpendar et al. which claims that for the 1-deletion channel, the input entropy is maximized by the alternating sequences over all binary sequences. This conjecture is also verified for the 2-deletion channel, where it is proved that constant sequences with a single run minimize the input entropy.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the Adversarial Threat Model in Quantitative Information Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an extended framework for quantitative information flow (QIF), aligned with the previously proposed core-concave generalization of entropy measures, to include adversaries that use Kolmogorov-Nagumo $f$-mean to infer secrets in a private system. Specifically, in our setting, an adversary uses Kolmogorov-Nagumo $f$-mean to compute its best actions before and after observing the system's randomized outputs. This leads to generalized notions of prior and posterior vulnerability and generalized axiomatic relations that we will derive to elucidate how these $f$-mean based vulnerabilities interact with each other. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by showing how some notions of leakage that had been derived outside of the QIF framework and so far seemed incompatible with it are indeed explainable via such an extension of QIF. These leakage measures include $\alpha$-leakage, which is the same as Arimoto mutual information of order $\alpha$, maximal $\alpha$-leakage, which is the $\alpha$-leakage capacity, and maximal $(\alpha,\beta)$-leakage, which is a generalization of the above and captures local differential privacy as a special case. We define the notion of generalized capacity and provide partial results for special classes of functions used in the Kolmogorov-Nagumo mean. We also propose a new pointwise notion of gain function, which we coin pointwise information gain. We show that this pointwise information gain can explain R{\'e}yni divergence and Sibson mutual information of order $\alpha \in [0,\infty]$ as the Kolmogorov-Nagumo average of the gain with a proper choice of function $f$.</description>

      <title>DFRC Systems Co-existing in Licensed Spectrum: Cognitive Beamforming Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with cognitive radio capability to tackle the spectral scarcity problem in wireless communications. Particularly, a cognitive DFRC system operates on a spectrum owned by a primary system to simultaneously perform data communication and target tracking with the condition that its interference to the primary users (PUs) is below a certain threshold. To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly design the beamforming vectors for both the radar and communication functions in such a way that the mean square error (MSE) of the beam pattern between the designed and desired waveforms is minimized. The optimization problem has the following three constraints: i) the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each data communication user is above a predetermined level; ii) the per-antenna transmit power is maintained at a given level; iii) the interference imposed on each PU is below a certain threshold. Both the semidefinite relaxation and nature-inspired firefly algorithms are proposed in order to search for the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. The simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithms can enable the DFRC system to protect the PUs while simultaneously performing its communication and radar functions.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) states that in the limit of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random experiments, the output sequence is virtually certain to come from the typical set, each member of which is almost equally likely. This property is a form of the law of large numbers and lies at the heart of information theory. In this work, we prove a generalized quantum AEP beyond the i.i.d. framework where the random samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under suitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant divergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More specifically, both the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy (a smoothed form of the min-relative entropy) and the smoothed max-relative entropy approach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the asymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently estimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization, provided that the sets have efficient descriptions. The generalized AEP directly implies a new generalized quantum Stein's lemma for conducting quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states. This addresses open questions raised by Brand\~{a}o et al. [IEEE TIT 66(8):5037-5054 (2020)] and Mosonyi et al. [IEEE TIT 68(2):1032-1067 (2022)], which seek a Stein's lemma with computational efficiency. Moreover, we propose a new framework for quantum resource theory in which state transformations are performed without requiring precise characterization of the states being manipulated, making it more robust to imperfections. We demonstrate the reversibility (also referred to as the second law) of such a theory and identify the regularized relative entropy as the unique measure of the resource in this new framework.</description>

      <title>The time scale of redundancy between prosody and linguistic context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spoken communication, information is transmitted not only via words, but also through a rich array of non-verbal signals, including prosody--the non-segmental auditory features of speech. Do these different communication channels carry distinct information? Prior work has shown that the information carried by prosodic features is substantially redundant with that carried by the surrounding words. Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this relationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future contexts. We find that a word's prosodic features require an extended past context (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given that long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate communication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a word's prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with a short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term planning in language production. Thus, prosody may facilitate communication by helping listeners predict upcoming material. In tandem, our results highlight potentially distinct roles that prosody plays in facilitating integration of words into past contexts and in helping predict upcoming words.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and partial majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider families of tight upper bounds on the difference $S(\rho)-S(\sigma)$ with the rank/energy constraint imposed on the state $\rho$ which are valid provided that the state $\rho$ partially majorizes the state $\sigma$ and is close to the state $\sigma$ w.r.t. the trace norm.
  The upper bounds within these families depend on the parameter $m$ of partial majorization. The upper bounds corresponding to $m=0$ coincide with the (unconditional) optimal semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy with the rank/energy constraint obtained in [Lett.Math.Phys.,113,121,35] and [arXiv:2410.02686]. State-dependent improvements of these semicontinuity bounds are proposed and analysed numerically.
  The notion of $\varepsilon$-sufficient majorization dimension of the set of states with bounded energy is introduced and analysed.
  Classical versions of the above results formulated in terms of probability distributions and the Shannon entropy are also considered.</description>

      <title>PersianMedQA: Language-Centric Evaluation of LLMs in the Persian Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA</description>

      <title>MLorc: Momentum Low-rank Compression for Large Language Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increasing size of large language models (LLMs), full-parameter fine-tuning imposes substantial memory demands. To alleviate this, we propose a novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression (MLorc). By directly compressing and reconstructing momentum rather than gradients, MLorc avoids imposing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update matrices and better preserves the training dynamics of full-parameter fine-tuning, in contrast to existing low-rank approaches such as LoRA and GaLore. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning with a small rank (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under reasonable assumptions.</description>
