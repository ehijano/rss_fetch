      <title>Non-solutions to mixed equations in acylindrically hyperbolic groups coming from random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed equation in a group $G$ is given by a non-trivial element $w (x)$ of the free product $G \ast \mathbb{Z}$, and a solution is some $g\in G$ such that $w(g)$ is the identity. For $G$ acylindrically hyperbolic with trivial finite radical (e.g. torsion-free) we show that any mixed equation of length $n$ has a non-solution of length comparable to $\log(n)$, which is the best possible bound. Similarly, we show that there is a common non-solution of length $O(n)$ to all mixed equations of length $n$, again the best possible bound. In fact, in both cases we show that a random walk of appropriate length yields a non-solution with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Polygroupoid, Polyquasigroup, Polyloop and their Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, new hyper-algebraic structures called polygroupoid, polyquasigroup and polyloop were introduced with concrete examples given. The first, second, third and fourth left (middle, right) nuclei of polygroupoid were introduced and studied. It was shown that first left (middle, right) nuclei of a polygroupoid is contained in second, third and fourth left (middle, right) nuclei of the polygroupoid. Hence, the second, third and fourth left (middle, right) nuclei of a polygroupoid generalize the first left (middle, right) nuclei of the polygroupoid. Examples of polyquasigroups and polyloops that satisfy the above results were provided.</description>

      <title>Contracting elements and conjugacy growth in Coxeter groups, graph products, and further groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we construct contracting elements in the standard Cayley graphs of the so-called periagroups, a family of groups introduced by the second-named author which include Coxeter groups, graph products, and Dyer groups. As a consequence, we deduce that, unless they virtually split as direct products, periagroups are acylindrically hyperbolic and their conjugacy growth series, with respect to standard generating sets, are transcendental.</description>

      <title>On some classes of non-commutative dimonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the study of dimonoids, algebraic structures with two associative binary operations that satisfy a prescribed system of axioms. We investigate the properties of dual dimonoids. In the class of non-commutative dimonoids, we construct a number of abelian, non-abelian, and rectangular dimonoids. The internal structure of these objects is analyzed, in particular, their automorphism groups and halos are computed.</description>

      <title>Product separability in central extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a central extension of locally quasiconvex subgroup separable hyperbolic group is product separable, so long as it is subgroup separable. We also establish that a central extension of a double coset separable group by a finitely generated group is double coset separable if and only if it is subgroup separable, and that double coset separability is stable under taking direct products with finitely generated nilpotent groups.</description>

      <title>The Excess Zero Graph of a Coxeter Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Coxeter group $W$ with length function $\ell$, the excess zero graph $\mathcal{E}_0(W)$ has vertex set the non-identity involutions of $W$, with two involutions $x$ and $y$ adjacent whenever $\ell(xy)=\ell(x)+\ell(y)$. Properties of this graph such as connectivity, diameter and valencies of certain vertices of $\mathcal{E}_0(W)$ are explored.</description>

      <title>MST3 Encryption improvement with three-parameter group of Hermitian function field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This scholarly work presents an advanced cryptographic framework utilizing automorphism groups as the foundational structure for encryption scheme implementation. The proposed methodology employs a three-parameter group construction, distinguished by its application of logarithmic signatures positioned outside the group's center, a significant departure from conventional approaches. A key innovation in this implementation is utilizing the Hermitian function field as the underlying mathematical framework. This particular function field provides enhanced structural properties that strengthen the cryptographic protocol when integrated with the three-parameter group architecture. The encryption mechanism features phased key de-encapsulation from ciphertext, representing a substantial advantage over alternative implementations. This sequential extraction process introduces additional computational complexity for potential adversaries while maintaining efficient legitimate decryption. A notable characteristic of this cryptosystem is the direct correlation between the underlying group's mathematical strength and both the attack complexity and message size parameters. This relationship enables precise security-efficiency calibration based on specific implementation requirements and threat models. The application of automorphism groups with logarithmic signatures positioned outside the center represents a significant advancement in non-traditional cryptographic designs, particularly relevant in the context of post-quantum cryptographic resilience.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy width in uniform higher rank arithmetic groups of orthogonal type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study widths of conjugacy classes in anisotropic higher rank $S$-arithmetic groups of orthogonal type. Assuming the GRH, we prove that many such groups have bounded conjugacy width. For example, this holds if the degree is greater or equal to 17 and $S$ contains a non-archimedean place. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first boundedness result proved for anisotropic groups. The proof uses ideas from the Congruence Subgroup Problem. In particular, we define and compute a non standard version of the metaplectic kernel. Conversely, we prove that a quantitative bound on the width of conjugacy classes implies the CSP. The machinery we develop can also be used for other width questions. For example, in \cite{AM25} we prove, unconditional on GRH, new cases of bounded generation of arithmetic groups.</description>

      <title>Groups which are metrically weakly sofic with respect to word norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider metric versions of weak soficity, LEF and residual finiteness. The main results of the paper extend Glebsky and Rivera's characterization of weak soficity to the case of normally finitely generated groups with word metrics. Metric LEF and residual finiteness are also characterized in this class. We deduce that the free group $\mathsf{F}_2$ is not metrically weakly sofic with respect to its standard invariant word norm.</description>

      <title>Commutator subalgebra of the Lie algebra associated with a right-angled Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the graded Lie algebra $L(RC_K)$ associated with the lower central series of a right-angled Coxeter group $RC_K$. We prove that its commutator subalgebra is a quotient of the polynomial ring over an auxiliary Lie subalgebra $N_K$ of the graph Lie algebra $L_K$, and conjecture that the quotient map is an isomorphism. The epimorphism is defined in terms of a new operation in the associated Lie algebra, which corresponds to the squaring and has an analogue in homotopy theory.</description>
