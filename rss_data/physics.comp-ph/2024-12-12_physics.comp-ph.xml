      <title>Threading in star catenanes: The role of ring rigidity, topology and environmental crowding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the probability of threading in star catenanes under good solvent conditions using molecular dynamics simulations, emphasizing the influence of ring rigidity. Threading in these systems arises from the interplay between the intrinsic topology of and within the star-shaped structure and the bending rigidity of individual rings. It is demonstrated that reduced ring flexibility enhances threading, and the presence of mechanical bonds is critical for threading formation. Notably, the bending rigidity of the rings alters their shapes, resulting in a non-monotonic threading probability with a peak at intermediate rigidity. Furthermore, increasing ring length is found to significantly boost threading probability. These findings elucidate the intricate relationships among topology and rigidity in governing threading, with implications for the design of advanced molecular systems and materials. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding threading in good solvent conditions, where such behavior is typically improbable for ring polymers, and opens avenues for the development of molecular machines and other complex architectures.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Collision Operator for the Lattice Boltzmann Method Based on Invariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating machine learning techniques in established numerical solvers represents a modern approach to enhancing computational fluid dynamics simulations. Within the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), the collision operator serves as an ideal entry point to incorporate machine learning techniques to enhance its accuracy and stability. In this work, an invariant neural network is constructed, acting on an equivariant collision operator, optimizing the relaxation rates of non-physical moments. This optimization enhances robustness to symmetry transformations and ensures consistent behavior across geometric operations. The proposed neural collision operator (NCO) is trained using forced isotropic turbulence simulations driven by spectral forcing, ensuring stable turbulence statistics. The desired performance is achieved by minimizing the energy spectrum discrepancy between direct numerical simulations and underresolved simulations over a specified wave number range. The loss function is further extended to tailor numerical dissipation at high wave numbers, ensuring robustness without compromising accuracy at low and intermediate wave numbers. The NCO's performance is demonstrated using three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) flows, where it accurately predicts the dynamics even in highly underresolved simulations. Compared to other LBM models, such as the BGK and KBC operators, the NCO exhibits superior accuracy while maintaining stability. In addition, the operator shows robust performance in alternative configurations, including turbulent three-dimensional cylinder flow. Finally, an alternative training procedure using time-dependent quantities is introduced. It is based on a reduced TGV model along with newly proposed symmetry boundary conditions. The reduction in memory consumption enables training at higher Reynolds numbers, successfully leading to stable yet accurate simulations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Galaxy Field Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05131v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of precision cosmology, the ability to generate accurate and large-scale galaxy catalogs is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe. With the flood of cosmological data from current and upcoming missions, generating theoretical predictions to compare with these observations is essential for constraining key cosmological parameters. While traditional methods, such as the Halo-Occupation Distribution (HOD), have provided foundational insights, they struggle to balance the need for both accuracy and computational efficiency. High-fidelity hydrodynamic simulations offer improved precision but are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach that harnesses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Diffusion Models, trained on the CAMELS simulation suite, to bridge the gap between computationally inexpensive dark matter simulations and the galaxy distributions of more costly hydrodynamic simulations. Our method not only outperforms traditional HOD techniques in accuracy but also significantly accelerates the simulation process, offering a scalable solution for next-generation cosmological surveys. This advancement has the potential to revolutionize galaxy catalog generation, enabling more precise, data-driven cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Conservative-to-Primitive Conversion in Hybrid Piecewise Polytropic and Tabulated Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel AI-based approach to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding methods are computationally intensive, particularly in large-scale simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal loss in accuracy. The NNC2PS model achieves $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ errors of $4.54 \times 10^{-7}$ and $3.44 \times 10^{-6}$, respectively, with the NNC2PL model yielding even lower error values. TensorRT optimization ensures high accuracy, with FP16 quantization offering 7x faster performance than traditional root-finding methods. Our AI models outperform conventional CPU solvers, demonstrating enhanced inference times, particularly for large datasets. We release the scientific software developed for this work, enabling the validation and extension of our findings. These results highlight the potential of AI, combined with GPU optimization, to significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>Fast GPU-Powered and Auto-Differentiable Forward Modeling of IFU Data Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RUBIX, a fully tested, well-documented, and modular Open Source tool developed in JAX, designed to forward model IFU cubes of galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The code automatically parallelizes computations across multiple GPUs, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-the-art codes by a factor of 600. This optimization reduces compute times from hours to only seconds. RUBIX leverages JAX's auto-differentiation capabilities to enable not only forward modeling but also gradient computations through the entire pipeline paving the way for new methodological approaches such as e.g. gradient-based optimization of astrophysics model parameters. RUBIX is open-source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/ufuk-cakir/rubix.</description>

      <title>Spin-glass dynamics: experiment, theory and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of high-quality single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose massive computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental time and length scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to the concept of temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change -- including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory -- are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</description>

      <title>Non-binary dynamical Ising machines for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical Ising machines achieve accelerated solving of complex combinatorial optimization problems by remapping the convergence to the ground state of the classical spin networks to the evolution of specially constructed continuous dynamical systems. The main adapted principle of constructing such systems is based on requiring that, on the one hand, the system converges to a binary state and, on the other hand, the system's energy in such states mimics the classical Ising Hamiltonian. The emergence of binary-like states is regarded to be an indispensable feature of dynamical Ising machines as it establishes the relation between the machine's continuous terminal state and the inherently discrete solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. This is emphasized by problems where the unknown quantities are represented by spin complexes, for example, the graph coloring problem. In such cases, an imprecise mapping of the continuous states to spin configurations may lead to invalid solutions requiring intensive post-processing. In contrast to such an approach, we show that there exists a class of non-binary dynamical Ising machines without the incongruity between the continuous character of the machine's states and the discreteness of the spin states. We demonstrate this feature by applying such a machine to the problems of finding proper graph coloring, constructing Latin squares, and solving Sudoku puzzles. Thus, we demonstrate that the information characterizing discrete states can be unambiguously presented in essentially continuous dynamical systems. This opens new opportunities in the realization of scalable electronic accelerators of combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Gromov ground state in phase space engineering for fusion energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase space engineering by RF waves plays important roles in both thermal D-T fusion and non-thermal advanced fuel fusion. But not all phase space manipulation is allowed, certain fundamental limits exist. In addition to Liouville's theorem, which requires the manipulation to be volume-preserving, Gromov's non-squeezing theorem imposes another constraint. The Gardner ground state is defined as the ground state accessible by smooth volume-preserving maps. However, the extra Gromov constraint should produce a higher-energy ground state. An example of a Gardner ground state forbidden by Gromov's non-squeezing theorem is given. The challenge question is: What is the Gromov ground state, i.e., the lowest energy state accessible by smooth symplectic maps? This is a difficult problem. As a simplification, we conjecture that the linear Gromov ground state problem is solvable.</description>

Abstract: We develop a ray-tracing model for laser-plasma interaction suitable for coupling in-line into kinetic particle-in-cell plasma simulation. The model is based on inverse Bremsstrahlung absorption and includes oblique incidence effects and reflection at the critical surface.

      <title>Cauliflower shapes of bacterial clusters in the off-lattice Eden model for bacterial growth in a Petri dish with an agar layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed the off-lattice Eden model to simulate the growth of bacterial colonies in the three-dimensional geometry of a Petri dish. In contrast to its two-dimensional counterpart, our model takes a three-dimensional set of possible growth directions and employs additional constraints on growth, which are limited by access to the nutrient layer. We rigorously tested the basic off-lattice Eden implementation against literature data for a planar cluster. We then extended it to three-dimensional growth. Our model successfully demonstrated the non-trivial dependency of the cluster morphology, non-monotonous dependency of the cluster density, and power law of the thickness of the boundary layer of clusters as a function of the nutrient layer height. Moreover, we revealed the fractal nature of all the clusters by investigating their fractal dimensions. Our density results allowed us to estimate the basic transport properties, namely the permeability and tortuosity of the bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>Descriptors-free Collective Variables From Geometric Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling simulations make the computational study of rare events feasible. A large family of such methods crucially depends on the definition of some collective variables (CVs) that could provide a low-dimensional representation of the relevant physics of the process. Recently, many methods have been proposed to semi-automatize the CV design by using machine learning tools to learn the variables directly from the simulation data. However, most methods are based on feed-forward neural networks and require as input some user-defined physical descriptors. Here, we propose to bypass this step using a graph neural network to directly use the atomic coordinates as input for the CV model. This way, we achieve a fully automatic approach to CV determination that provides variables invariant under the relevant symmetries, especially the permutational one. Furthermore, we provide different analysis tools to favor the physical interpretation of the final CV. We prove the robustness of our approach using different methods from the literature for the optimization of the CV, and we prove its efficacy on several systems, including a small peptide, an ion dissociation in explicit solvent, and a simple chemical reaction.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An unstable orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. Quasi-particle peaks appear at the Fermi level due to an interorbital hopping between the localized ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ and delocalized Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Multi-material Classification of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Atomic Force Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for the data-driven design of materials based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other scanning probe microscopy. These tools enhance efficiency in inverse design and characterization of materials. However, limited and imbalanced experimental materials data typically available is a major challenge. Also important is the need to interpret trained models, which have typically been complex enough to be uninterpretable by humans. Here, we present a systemic evaluation of transfer learning strategies to accommodate low-data scenarios in materials synthesis and a model latent feature analysis to draw connections to the human-interpretable characteristics of the samples. Our models show accurate predictions in five classes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and Mo-WSe$_2$) with up to 89$\%$ accuracy on held-out test samples. Analysis of the latent features reveals a correlation with physical characteristics such as grain density, DoG blob, and local variation. The transfer learning optimization modality and the exploration of the correlation between the latent and physical features provide important frameworks that can be applied to other classes of materials beyond TMDs to enhance the models' performance and explainability which can accelerate the inverse design of materials for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating Material Interface Diffusion Phenomena through Graph Neural Networks in Applied Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting interface diffusion phenomena in materials is crucial for various industrial applications, including semiconductor manufacturing, battery technology, and catalysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to investigate and model material interface diffusion. We begin by collecting experimental and simulated data on diffusion coefficients, concentration gradients, and other relevant parameters from diverse material systems. The data are preprocessed, and key features influencing interface diffusion are extracted. Subsequently, we construct a GNN model tailored to the diffusion problem, with a graph representation capturing the atomic structure of materials. The model architecture includes multiple graph convolutional layers for feature aggregation and update, as well as optional graph attention layers to capture complex relationships between atoms. We train and validate the GNN model using the preprocessed data, achieving accurate predictions of diffusion coefficients, diffusion rates, concentration profiles, and potential diffusion pathways. Our approach offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of interface diffusion and provides a valuable tool for optimizing material design and engineering. Additionally, our method offers possible strategies to solve the longstanding problems related to materials interface diffusion.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by Kp (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions was revealed using Potential Learning (PL). We also discussed dependence of particular solar wind plasma density on moderate geomagnetic conditions. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity solar wind density begins to control Kp. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp under southward IMF conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the 22 years' OMNI solar wind database were used as the inputs. PL extracted the solar wind velocity as the most significant, and further solar wind number density was the second most influential parameter for the moderate Kp under southward IMF conditions. This result was the same as the previous PL result in relation between extremely low and high Kp for southward IMF. Based on statistical investigations using solar wind speed and plasma density database used in PL under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions remain high while the plasma number density becomes large, even if the solar wind velocity is slow. This shows that not only solar wind velocity but also plasma density plays a crucial role in causing geomagnetic disturbances, following empirical relation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. The results obtained from PL and incidental statistical investigations using the PL database suggest that the solar wind density begins to affect Kp from moderate geomagnetic activity even under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>

      <title>A new interpolated pseudodifferential preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new pseudodifferential preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation in variable media with absorption. The pseudodifferential operator is associated with the multiplicative inverse to the symbol of the Helmholtz operator. This approach is well-suited for the intermediate and high-frequency regimes. The main novel idea for the fast evaluation of the preconditioner is to interpolate its symbol, not as a function of the (high-dimensional) phase-space variables, but as a function of the wave speed itself. Since the wave speed is a real-valued function, this approach allows us to interpolate in a univariate setting even when the original problem is posed in a multidimensional physical space. As a result, the needed number of interpolation points is small, and the interpolation coefficients can be computed using the fast Fourier transform. The overall computational complexity is log-linear with respect to the degrees of freedom as inherited from the fast Fourier transform. We present some numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner to solve the discrete Helmholtz equation using the GMRES iterative method. The implementation of an absorbing layer for scattering problems using a complex-valued wave speed is also developed. Limitations and possible extensions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Fast Laplace transforms on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$ as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, machine learning, and finance.</description>
