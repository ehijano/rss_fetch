      <title>The role of hydrodynamics in the synchronisation of {\it Chlamydomonas} flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While hydrodynamic coupling has long been considered essential for synchronisation of eukaryotic flagella, recent experiments on the unicellular biflagellate model organism {\it Chlamydomonas} demonstrate that -- at the single cell level -- intracellular mechanical coupling is necessary for coordination. It is therefore unclear what role, if any, hydrodynamic forces actually play in the synchronisation of multiple flagella within individual cells, arguably the building block of large scale coordination. Here we address this question experimentally by transiently blocking hydrodynamic coupling between the two flagella of single {\it Chlamydomonas}. Our results reveal that in wild type cells intracellularly-mediated forces are necessary and sufficient for flagellar synchronisation, with hydrodynamic coupling causing minimal changes in flagellar dynamics. However, fluid-mediated ciliary coupling is responsible for the extended periods of anti-phase synchronisation observed in a mutant with weaker intracellular coupling. At the single-cell level, therefore, flagellar coordination depends on a subtle balance between intracellular and extracellular forces.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy analysis of bamboo and tooth using 4-angle polarization micro-spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the anisotropic properties of biomaterials, two distinct classes are considered: polymer-based (e.g., cellulose in plants) and crystalline-based (e.g., enamel in teeth), each demonstrating distinct structural and functional characteristics. Four-angle polarization (4-pol.) spectral mapping of sub-1 {\mu}m bamboo slices was carried out in the mid-IR spectral range (2.5-20 {\mu}m) to reveal the 3D organization of the chemical bonding of cellulose using the key characteristic absorption bands associated with C-O-C and C-N vibrational modes. The longitudinal and transverse microtome slices revealed a switch between the presence and absence of dichroism in parenchyma cell walls and vascular bundles. The cell wall showed continuous alignment of the C-O-C stretching vibrational mode (8.6 {\mu}m/1163 cm-1) down to the pixel resolution of ~ 4 {\mu}m (the step size in imaging) in the transverse slice; the cell wall thickness is ~ 1 {\mu}m. Thin microtomed slices of a tooth were measured in transmission and reflection modes. The single-point reflection measurements, performed using two perpendicular orientations, revealed orientational anisotropy in the enamel, which was absent in the dentin region. High sub-diffraction limited lateral resolution was numerically validated using a simplified-model of a Gaussian beam reading out material pixels with a defined orientation of absorption. It is shown that the orientation of small ~ {\lambda}/10 ~ 1 {\mu}m objects can be revealed using a focal spot of ~ {\lambda}/NA ~ 20 {\mu}m, defining the diffraction limit for the objective lens with a numerical aperture NA ~ 0.5.</description>

      <title>Stability of complex communities: A perspective from discrete-time dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the stability of complex communities is a central focus in ecology, many important theoretical advancements have been made to identify drivers of ecological stability. However, previous results often rely on the continuous-time dynamics, assuming that species have overlapping generations. In contrast, numerous real-world communities consist of species with non-overlapping generations, whose quantitative behavior can only be precisely represented by discrete-time dynamics rather than continuous ones. Here, we develop a theoretical framework and propose a metric to quantify the stability of complex communities characterized by non-overlapping generations and diverse interaction types. In stark contrast to existing results for overlapping generations, we find that increasing self-regulation strength first stabilizes and then destabilizes complex communities. This pattern is further confirmed in both exploitative (E. aerogenes, P. aurantiaca, P. chlororaphis, P. citronellolis) and competitive (P. putida, P. veroni, S. marcescens) soil microbial communities. Moreover, we show that communities with diverse interaction types become the most stable, which is corroborated by empirical mouse microbial networks. Furthermore, we reveal that the prevalence of weak interactions can stabilize communities, which is consistent with findings from existing microbial experiments. Our analyses of complex communities with non-overlapping generations provide a more comprehensive understanding of ecological stability and informs practical strategies for ecological restoration and control.</description>

      <title>Bayesian eco-evolutionary game dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of classical game theory and evolutionary game theory is well-established. However, evolutionary game theorists have mostly tapped into the classical game of complete information where players are completely informed of all other players' payoffs. Of late, there is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the environment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are influenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information about the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like usually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by the players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true state erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may adopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in different perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player would be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an incomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we contemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players are equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus. Herein, we illustrate this connection using a setup of infinitely large, well-mixed population of players equipped with two actions for exploiting a resource (the environment) at two different rates so that the resource state evolves accordingly. The state of the resource impacts every player's decision of playing particular action. We investigate continuous state environment in the presence of a Gaussian noisy channel. Employing the formalism of replicator dynamics, we find that noisy information can be effective in preventing resource from going extinct.</description>

      <title>Designing optimal elastic filaments for viscous propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propulsion of many eukaryotic cells is generated by flagella, flexible slender filaments that are actively oscillating in space and time. The dynamics of these biological appendages have inspired the design of many types of artificial microswimmers. The magnitude of the filament's viscous propulsion depends on the time-varying shape of the filament, and that shape depends in turn on the spatial distribution of the bending rigidity of the filament. In this work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical (bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using mathematical optimisation. Specifically, by considering a model system (a slender elastic filament with an oscillating slope at its base), we derive the optimal bending rigidity function along the filament that maximises the time-averaged thrust produced by the actuated filament. Instead of prescribing a specific functional form, we use functional optimisation and adjoint-based variational calculus to formally establish the link between the distribution of bending rigidity and propulsion. The optimal rigidities are found to be stiff near the base, and soft near the distal end, with a spatial distribution that depends critically on the constraints used in the optimisation procedure. These findings may guide the optimal design of future artificial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Optimal first-passage times of active Brownian particles under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of an active Brownian particle under stochastic resetting to its initial configuration, comprising its position and orientation, to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Coupling a perturbative approach for low P\'eclet numbers, measuring the relative importance of self-propulsion with respect to diffusion, with the renewal framework for the stochastic resetting process, we derive analytical expressions for the survival probability, the FPT probability density, and the associated low-order moments. Depending on their initial orientation, the minimal mean FPT for active particles to reach the boundary can both decrease and increase relative to the passive counterpart. The associated optimal resetting rates depend non-trivially on the initial distance to the boundary due to the intricate interplay of resetting, rotational Brownian noise, and active motion.</description>

      <title>A complimentary impedance spectroscopy biosensing method with graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method where a bioactive functional layer on an electrically conductive thin film with high sheet resistance can be effectively used for complementary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensing. The functional layer's properties, such as double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer resistance, influence the complex impedance of the thin film in direct contact with the layer. These measurements can be performed using a simple low-frequency setup with a lock-in amplifier. When graphene is used as the resistive thin film, the signal may also include contributions from graphene's quantum capacitance, which is sensitive to charge transfer to and from the graphene. Unlike in traditional graphene biosensors, changes in electrolyte properties over time, such as those caused by the dissolution of ambient gases, do not significantly affect AC measurements. This technique supports biosensor miniaturization, ensures stable operation, and provides reliable biomarker detection with a high signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity shapes inference in biological reactions driven by a latent trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are quantified by counts of observable events, from the annihilation of quasiparticles in a lattice to predator-prey encounters on a landscape to spikes in a neural network. These events are triggered at random intervals, when an underlying, often unobserved and therefore latent, dynamical system occupies a set of reactive states within its phase space. We show how the ergodicity of this latent dynamical system, i.e. existence of a well-behaved limiting stationary distribution, constrains the statistics of the reaction counts. This formulation makes explicit the conditions under which the counting process approaches a limiting Poisson process, a subject of debate in the application of counting processes to different fields. We show that the overdispersal relative to this limit encodes properties of the latent trajectory through its hitting times. These results set bounds on how information about a latent process can be inferred from a local detector, which we explore for two biophysical scenarios. First, in estimating an animal's activity level by how often it crosses a detector, we show how the mean count can fail to give any information on movement parameters, which are encoded in higher order moments. Second, we show how the variance of the inter-reaction time sets a fundamental limit on how precisely the size of a population of trajectories can be inferred by a detector, vastly generalizing the Berg-Purcell limit for chemosensation. Overall, we develop a flexible theoretical framework to quantify inter-event time distributions in reaction-diffusion systems that clarifies existing debates in the literature and explicitly shows which properties of latent processes can be inferred from observed reactions.</description>
