      <title>Structure of a fourth-order dispersive flow equation through the generalized Hasimoto transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a one-dimensional fourth-order nonlinear dispersive partial differential equation for curve flows on a K\"ahler manifold. The equation arises as a fourth-order extension of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger flow equation, with physical and geometrical backgrounds. First, this paper presents a framework that can transform the equation into a system of fourth-order nonlinear dispersive partial differential-integral equations for complex-valued functions. This is achieved by developing the so-called generalized Hasimoto transformation, which enables us to handle general higher-dimensional compact K\"ahler manifolds. Second, this paper demonstrates the computations to obtain the explicit expression of the derived system for three examples of the compact K\"ahler manifolds, dealing with the complex Grassmannian as an example in detail.</description>

      <title>The Serre spectral sequence of a Lie subalgebroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a spectral sequence approximating Lie algebroid cohomology associated to a Lie subalgebroid. This is a simultaneous generalisation of several classical constructions in differential geometry, including the Leray-Serre spectral sequence for de Rham cohomology associated to a fibration, the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for Lie algebras, and the Mackenzie spectral sequence for Lie algebroid extensions. We show that, for wide Lie subalgebroids, the spectral sequence converges to the Lie algebroid cohomology, and that, for Lie subalgebroids over proper submanifolds, the spectral sequence converges to the formal Lie algebroid cohomology. We discuss applications and recover several constructions in Poisson geometry in which this spectral sequence has appeared naturally in the literature.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces of signature (2,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study all four-dimensional simply-connected indecomposable non-semisimple pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces whose metric has signature (2,2). We present models and compute their isometry groups. We solve the problem of the existence or non-existence of compact quotients by properly acting discrete subgroups of the isometry group. This continues and completes earlier work by Maeta.</description>

      <title>Infinitely Many Half-Volume Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces via Min-Max Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M^{n+1},g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $3\le n+1\le 5$. We show that, if the metric $g$ is generic, then $M$ contains infinitely many geometrically distinct constant mean curvature hypersurfaces, each enclosing half the volume of $M$. As an essential part of the proof, we develop an Almgren-Pitts type min-max theory for certain non-local functionals of the general form $$\Omega \mapsto \operatorname{Area}(\partial \Omega) - \int_\Omega h + f(\operatorname{Vol}(\Omega)).$$</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Loop Spaces II: Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contains corrections to Madea, Rosenberg, Torres-Ardila, "The Geometry of Loop Spaces II: Characteristic Classes," Advances in Math. (287), 2016, 485-518. The main change is that results about $\pi_1({\rm Diff}(M))$ are replaced by results about $\pi_1({\rm Isom}(M))$, where Diff$(M)$, Isom$(M)$ refer to the diffeomorphism and isometry group of the manifold $M$.</description>

      <title>Discretized Gradient Flow for Manifold Learning in the Space of Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.09057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient descent, or negative gradient flow, is a standard technique in optimization to find minima of functions. Many implementations of gradient descent rely on discretized versions, i.e., moving in the gradient direction for a set step size, recomputing the gradient, and continuing. In this paper, we present an approach to manifold learning where gradient descent takes place in the infinite dimensional space $\mathcal{E} = {\rm Emb}(M,\mathbb{R}^N)$ of smooth embeddings $\phi$ of a manifold $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^N$. Implementing a discretized version of gradient descent for $P:\mathcal{E}\to {\mathbb R}$, a penalty function that scores an embedding $\phi \in \mathcal{E}$, requires estimating how far we can move in a fixed direction -- the direction of one gradient step -- before leaving the space of smooth embeddings. Our main result is to give an explicit lower bound for this step length in terms of the Riemannian geometry of $\phi(M)$. In particular, we consider the case when the gradient of $P$ is pointwise normal to the embedded manifold $\phi(M)$. We prove this case arises when $P$ is invariant under diffeomorphisms of $M$, a natural condition in manifold learning.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Time Singularities of the Lagrangian Mean Curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct solutions of Lagrangian mean curvature flow which exist and are embedded for all time, but form an infinite-time singularity and converge to an immersed special Lagrangian as $t\to\infty$. In particular, the flow decomposes the initial data into a union of special Lagrangians intersecting at one point. This result shows that infinite-time singularities can form in the Thomas--Yau `semi-stable' situation. A precise polynomial blow-up rate of the second fundamental form is also shown.
  The infinite-time singularity formation is obtained by a perturbation of an approximate family $N^{\varepsilon(t)}$ constructed by gluing in special Lagrangian `Lawlor necks' of size $\varepsilon(t)$, where the dynamics of the neck size $\varepsilon(t)$ are driven by the obstruction for the existence of nearby special Lagrangians to $N^{\varepsilon(t)}$. This is inspired by the work of Brendle and Kapouleas regarding ancient solutions of the Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ricci solitons coming out of weakly PIC1 metric cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Deruelle-Schulze-Simon, we study complete weakly PIC1 Ricci flows with Euclidean volume growth coming out of metric cones. We show that such a Ricci flow must be an expanding gradient Ricci soliton, and as a consequence, any metric cone at infinity of a complete weakly PIC1 K\"ahler manifold with Euclidean volume growth is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space in a canonical way.</description>

      <title>Nodal Volumes as Differentiable Functionals of Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the absolute continuity of the law and the Malliavin-Sobolev regularity of random nodal volumes associated with smooth Gaussian fields on generic $\mathcal{C}^2$ manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Our results extend and generalize the seminal contribution by Angst and Poly (2020) about stationary fields on Euclidean spaces and cover, in particular, the case of two-dimensional manifolds, possibly with boundary and corners. The main tools exploited in the proofs include the use of Gaussian measures on Banach spaces, Morse theory, and the characterization of Malliavin-Sobolev spaces in terms of ray absolute continuity. Several examples are analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>On the Meaning of Local Symmetries: Epistemic-Ontological Dialectics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose our account of the meaning of local symmetries. We argue that the general covariance principle and gauge principle both are principles of democratic epistemic access to the law of physics, leading to ontological insights about the objective nature of spacetime. We further argue that relationality is a core notion of general-relativistic gauge field theory, tacitly encoded by its (active) local symmetries.</description>
