      <title>Generalizing Brooks' theorem via Partial Coloring is Hard Classically and Locally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical and distributed complexity of \emph{$k$-partial $c$-coloring} where $c=k$, a natural generalization of Brooks' theorem where each vertex should be colored from the palette $\{1,\ldots,c\} = \{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that it must have at least $\min\{k, \deg(v)\}$ neighbors colored differently. Das, Fraigniaud, and Ros{\'{e}}n~[OPODIS 2023] showed that the problem of $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring admits efficient centralized and distributed algorithms and posed an open problem about the status of the distributed complexity of $k$-partial $k$-coloring. We show that the problem becomes significantly harder when the number of colors is reduced from $k+1$ to $k$ for every constant $k\geq 3$.
  In the classical setting, we prove that deciding whether a graph admits a $k$-partial $k$-coloring is NP-complete for every constant $k \geq 3$, revealing a sharp contrast with the linear-time solvable $(k+1)$-color case. For the distributed LOCAL model, we establish an $\Omega(n)$-round lower bound for computing $k$-partial $k$-colorings, even when the graph is guaranteed to be $k$-partial $k$-colorable. This demonstrates an exponential separation from the $O(\log^2 k \cdot \log n)$-round algorithms known for $(k+1)$-colorings.
  Our results leverage novel structural characterizations of ``hard instances'' where partial coloring reduces to proper coloring, and we construct intricate graph gadgets to prove lower bounds via indistinguishability arguments.</description>

      <title>Flipping odd matchings in geometric and combinatorial settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of reconfiguring odd matchings, that is, matchings that cover all but a single vertex. Our reconfiguration operation is a so-called flip where the unmatched vertex of the first matching gets matched, while consequently another vertex becomes unmatched. We consider two distinct settings: the geometric setting, in which the vertices are points embedded in the plane and all occurring odd matchings are crossing-free, and a combinatorial setting, in which we consider odd matchings in general graphs.
  For the latter setting, we provide a complete polynomial time checkable characterization of graphs in which any two odd matchings can be reconfigured into each another. This complements the previously known result that the flip graph is always connected in the geometric setting [Aichholzer, Br\"otzner, Perz, and Schnider. Flips in odd matchings]. In the combinatorial setting, we prove that the diameter of the flip graph, if connected, is linear in the number of vertices. Furthermore, we establish that deciding whether there exists a flip sequence of length $k$ transforming one given matching into another is NP-complete in both the combinatorial and the geometric settings. To prove the latter, we introduce a framework that allows us to transform partial order types into general position with only polynomial overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that when parameterized by the flip distance $k$, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the geometric setting when restricted to convex point sets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: B\'erczi, Chandrasekaran, Kir\'aly, and Kulkarni (ICALP 2024) recently described a splitting-off procedure in hypergraphs that preserves local-connectivity and outlined some applications. In this note we give an alternative proof via element-connectivity preserving reduction operations in graphs.</description>

      <title>Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \&amp; Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs and their connectivity using graphlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphlets are small subgraphs rooted at a fixed vertex. The number of occurrences of graphlets aligned to a particular vertex, called graphlet degree sequence, gives a topological description of the surrounding of the analyzed vertex. In this article, we study properties and uniqueness of graphlet degree sequences. The information given by graphlets up to size (n-1) is utilized graphs having certain type of asymmetric vertex-deleted subgraphs. Moreover, we show a reconstruction of trees from their (&lt;= n-1)-graphlet degree sequences, which is much easier compared to the standard reconstruction from vertex-deleted subgraphs.</description>

      <title>An abstract structure determines the contextuality degree of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article delves into the concept of quantum contextuality, specifically focusing on proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem obtained by assigning Pauli observables to hypergraph vertices satisfying a given commutation relation. The abstract structure composed of this hypergraph and the graph of anticommutations is named a hypergram. Its labelings with Pauli observables generalize the well-known magic sets. A first result is that all these correct quantum labelings of a given hypergram inherently possess the same degree of contextuality. Then we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such quantum labelings and an efficient algorithm to find one of them. We finally attach to each assignable hypergram an abstract notion of contextuality degree. By presenting the study of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs from the perspectives of graphs and matrices, this abstraction opens the way to new methods to search for original contextual configurations.</description>

      <title>Prime Multiple Missing Graphs</title>

Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture remains open for nearly three centuries. Recently Goldbach graphs are introduced to relate the problem with the literature of Graph Theory. It is shown that the connectedness of the graphs is equivalent to the affirmative answer of the conjecture. Some modified version of the graphs, say, near Goldbach graphs are shown to be Hamiltonian for small number of vertices. In this context, we introduce a class of graphs, namely, prime multiple missing graphs such that near Goldbach graphs are finite intersections of these graphs. We study these graphs for primes 3,5 and in general for any odd prime p. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 3 and Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. Next the intersection of prime multiple missing graphs for primes 3 and 5 are studied. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 4 and they are also Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. We observe that the diameters of finite Goldbach graphs and near Goldbach graphs are bounded by 5 (up to 10000 vertices). We believe further study on these graphs with big data analysis will help to understand structures of near Goldbach graphs.</description>

      <title>Discrete Level Set Persistence for Finite Discrete Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sublevel set and superlevel set persistent homology on discrete functions through the perspective of finite ordered sets of both linearly ordered and cyclically ordered domains. Finite ordered sets also serve as the codomain of our functions making all arguments finite and discrete. We prove duality of filtrations of sublevel sets and superlevel sets that undergirths a range of duality results of sublevel set persistent homology without the need to invoke complications of continuous functions or classical Morse theory. We show that Morse-like behavior can be achieved for flat extrema without assuming genericity. Additionally, we show that with inversion of order, one can compute sublevel set persistence from superlevel set persistence, and vice versa via a duality result that does not require the boundary to be treated as a special case. Furthermore, we discuss aspects of barcode construction rules, surgery of circular and linearly ordered sets, as well as surgery on auxiliary structures such as box snakes, which segment the ordered set by extrema and monotones.</description>

      <title>Half-Iterates and Delta Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07625v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vivid contrast between two competing algorithms for solving Abel's equation $g(\theta(x)) = g(x) + 1$, given $\theta(x)$, is easily sketched. EJ is faster and more efficient, but ML evaluates a limit characterizing the principal solution $g(x)$ directly. EJ finds $g(x)+\delta$, where $\delta$ is possibly nonzero but independent of $x$. If we were to know an exact expression for $\delta$, then the "intrinsicality" of ML would be subsumed by EJ. Filling this gap in our knowledge is the aim of this paper.</description>
