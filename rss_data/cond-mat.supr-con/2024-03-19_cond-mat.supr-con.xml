      <title>ac Hall Effect and Photon Drag of Superconducting Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a theoretical description of the photogalvanic phenomena arising in superconducting condensates in the field of electromagnetic wave. The ac Hall effect and photon drag are shown to originate from the second-order nonlinear response of superconducting carriers caused by the suppression of their concentration due to the combined influence of the electron - hole asymmetry and charge imbalance generated by the incident electromagnetic wave. Starting from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory with the complex relaxation constant we develop a phenomenological description of these phenomena and investigate the resulting behavior of the dc supercurrent and second harmonic induced by microwave radiation incident on a superconductor surface.</description>

      <title>P-wave pairing near a spin-split Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and magnetism are competing effects that can coexist in certain regimes. Their co-existence leads to unexpected new behaviors that include the onset of exotic electron pair mechanisms and topological phases. In this work, we study the properties of a Josephson junction between two spin-split superconductors. The spin-splitting in the superconductors can arise from either the coupling to a ferromagnetic material or an external magnetic field. The properties of the junction are dominated by the Andreev bound states that are also split. One of these states can cross the superconductor's Fermi level, leading to a ground state transition characterized by a suppressed supercurrent. We interpret the supercurrent blockade as coming from a dominance of p-wave pairing close to the junction, where electrons at both sides of the junction pair. To support this interpretation, we analyze the different pairing channels and show that p-wave pairing is favored in the case where the magnetization of the two superconductors is parallel and suppressed in the anti-parallel case. We also analyze the noise spectrum that shows signatures of the ground state transition in the form of an elevated zero-frequency noise.</description>

      <title>The effect of niobium thin film structure on losses in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting microwave circuits is strongly influenced by the material properties of the superconducting film and substrate. While progress has been made in understanding the importance of surface preparation and the effect of surface oxides, the complex effect of superconductor film structure on microwave losses is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigate the microwave properties of niobium resonators with different crystalline properties and related surface topographies. We analyze a series of magnetron sputtered films in which the Nb crystal orientation and surface topography are changed by varying the substrate temperatures between room temperature and 975 K. The lowest-loss resonators that we measure have quality factors of over one million at single-photon powers, among the best ever recorded using the Nb on sapphire platform. We observe the highest quality factors in films grown at an intermediate temperature regime of the growth series (550 K) where the films display both preferential ordering of the crystal domains and low surface roughness. Furthermore, we analyze the temperature-dependent behavior of our resonators to learn about how the quasiparticle density in the Nb film is affected by the niobium crystal structure and the presence of grain boundaries. Our results stress the connection between the crystal structure of superconducting films and the loss mechanisms suffered by the resonators and demonstrate that even a moderate change in temperature during thin film deposition can significantly affect the resulting quality factors.</description>

      <title>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem, namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder (magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory (bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group (RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms and condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Electronic instability, layer selectivity and Fermi arcs in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using advanced dynamical mean-field theory on a realistic level we study the normal-state correlated electronic structure of the high-pressure superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and compare the features of the conventional bilayer (2222) Ruddelsden-Popper crystal structure with those of a newly-identified monolayer-trilayer (1313) alternation. Both structural cases display Ni-$d_{z^2}$ flat-band character at low-energy, which drives an electronic instability with a wave vector ${\bf q_{\rm I}}=(0.25,0.25,q_z)$ at ambient pressure, in line with recent experimental findings. The 1313 electronic structure exhibits significant layer selectivity, rendering especially the monolayer part to be Mott-critical. At high pressure, this layer selectivity weakens and the 1313 fermiology displays arcs reminiscent to those of high-$T_c$ cuprates. In contrast to dominant inter-site self-energy effects in the latter systems, here the Fermi arcs are the result of the multiorbital and multilayer interplay within a correlated flat-band scenario.</description>

      <title>Critical current throughout the BCS-BEC crossover with the inclusion of pairing fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work aims at providing a systematic analysis of the current density versus momentum characteristics for a fermionic superfluid throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, even in the fully homogeneous case. At low temperatures, where pairing fluctuations are not strong enough to invalidate a quasi-particle approach, a sharp threshold for the inception of a back-flow current is found, which sets the onset of dissipation and identifies the critical momentum according to Landau. This momentum is seen to smoothly evolve from the BCS to the BEC regimes, whereby a single expression for the single-particle current density that includes pairing fluctuations enables us to incorporate on equal footing two quite distinct dissipative mechanisms, namely, pair-breaking and phonon excitations in the two sides of the BCS-BEC crossover, respectively. At finite temperature, where thermal fluctuations broaden the excitation spectrum and make the dissipative (kinetic and thermal) mechanisms intertwined with each other, an alternative criterion due to Bardeen is instead employed to signal the loss of superfluid behavior. In this way, detailed comparison with available experimental data in linear and annular geometries is significantly improved with respect to previous approaches, thereby demonstrating the crucial role played by quantum fluctuations in renormalizing the single-particle excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Josephson diode effect in superconducting multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the Josephson current-phase relation within a planar diffuse tunnelling superconducting multilayer junction subjected to a parallel magnetic field. Our investigation involves computing the supercurrent associated with a fixed jump in the phase of the order parameter at each of the two insulating interfaces, allowing us to derive the current-phase relation for the junction. Employing perturbation theory in junction conductance, we determine both the first and second harmonics of the current-phase relation under specific magnetic field conditions. Notably, the presence of a strong spin-orbit interaction in the middle region of the junction introduces an anomalous Josephson effect. The interplay between spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions results in the emergence of an effective vector potential. This specific characteristic induces a phase shift in each harmonic of the current-phase relation without altering the overall shape of the relation. The mechanism for the Josephson diode effect is discussed for disordered junctions of multiband superconductors.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetic excitations in multilayer nickelate superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent reports of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we analyzed theoretically the magnetic excitations in the normal and the superconducting state in this compound, which can be measured by inelastic neutron scattering or RIXS. We show that the bilayer structure of the spin response allows to elucidate the role of the interlayer interaction and the nature of the Cooper-pairing in a very efficient way. In particular, we demonstrate the key difference between the potential $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave gaps, proposed recently, by comparing the corresponding response in the even and odd channels of the spin susceptibility. We show that the mostly interlayer driven bonding-antibonding $s_\pm$ Cooper-pairing produces a single large spin resonance peak in the odd channel only near the $X$ point whereas spin resonances in both the odd and the even channel are predicted for the $d$-wave scenario.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Meissner effect at the zero exceptional point in non-Hermitian two-band BCS model</title>

Abstract: The spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry in complex field theory at the exceptional point of the parameter space is known to exhibit interesting phenomena, such as the breakdown of a Higgs mechanism. In this work, we derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau model from a non-Hermitian two-band BCS model via path integral and investigate its spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that analog to the Higgs mechanism, the Meissner effect of the complex Ginzburg-Landau model also breaks down at the exceptional point while the gap parameters stay finite.</description>

      <title>Kinetic inductance traveling wave amplifier designs for practical microwave readout applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.</description>
