      <title>Instilling Doubts About Truth: Measuring the Impact of Tucker Carlson's Interview with Vladimir Putin Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On February 7, 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a two-hour interview with conservative political commentator, Tucker Carlson. This study investigated the impact of the Carlson- Putin interview on the US X audience. We proposed a framework of social media impact using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) by measuring changes in audience, structure, and content. Triangulation methods were used to validate the process and results. The interview had a considerable impact among segments of the American public: 1) the reach and engagement of far-right influencers increased after the interview, suggesting Kremlin narratives gained traction within these circles, 2) the communication structure became more vulnerable to disinformation spread after the interview, and 3) the public discourse changed from support for Ukraine funding to conversations about Putin, Russia, and the issue of "truth" or the veracity of Putin's claims. This research contributes to methods development for social media studies and aids scholars in analyzing how public opinion shapes policy debates. The Carlson-Putin interview sparked a broader discussion about truth-telling. Far from being muted, the broad impact of the interview appears considerable and poses challenges for foreign affairs leaders who depend on public support and buy-in when formulating national policy.</description>

      <title>"We're losing our neighborhoods. We're losing our community": A comparative analysis of community discourse in online and offline public spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering from crises, such as hurricanes or wildfires, is a complex process that can take weeks, months, or even decades to overcome. Crises have both acute (immediate) and chronic (long-term) effects on communities. Crisis informatics research often focuses on the immediate response phase of disasters, thereby overlooking the long-term recovery phase, which is critical for understanding the information needs of users undergoing challenges like climate gentrification and housing inequity. We fill this gap by investigating community discourse over eight months following Hurricane Ida in an online neighborhood Facebook group and Town Hall Meetings of a borough in the New York Metropolitan region. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined the use of social media to manage long-term disaster recovery. The findings revealed a significant overlap in topics, underscoring the interconnected nature of online and offline community discourse, and illuminated themes related to the long-term consequences of disasters. We conclude with recommendations aimed at helping designers and government leaders enhance participation across community forums and support recovery in the aftermath of disasters.</description>

      <title>Network Analysis of Global Banking Systems and Detection of Suspicious Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel network-based approach is introduced to analyze banking systems, focusing on two main themes: identifying influential nodes within global banking networks using Bank for International Settlements data and developing an algorithm to detect suspicious transactions for anti-money laundering. Leveraging the concept of adversarial networks, we examine Bank for International Settlements data to characterize low-key leaders and highly-exposed nodes in the context of financial contagion among countries. Low-key leaders are nodes with significant influence despite lower centrality, while highly-exposed nodes represent those most vulnerable to defaults. Separately, using anonymized transaction data from Rabobank, we design an anti-money laundering algorithm based on network partitioning via the Louvain method and cycle detection, identifying unreported transaction patterns indicative of potential money laundering. The findings provide insights into system-wide vulnerabilities and propose tools to address challenges in financial stability and regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>BicliqueEncoder: An Efficient Method for Link Prediction in Bipartite Networks using Formal Concept Analysis and Transformer Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and efficient method for link prediction in bipartite networks, using \textit{formal concept analysis} (FCA) and the Transformer encoder. Link prediction in bipartite networks finds practical applications in various domains such as product recommendation in online sales, and prediction of chemical-disease interaction in medical science. Since for link prediction, the topological structure of a network contains valuable information, many approaches focus on extracting structural features and then utilizing them for link prediction. Bi-cliques, as a type of structural feature of bipartite graphs, can be utilized for link prediction. Although several link prediction methods utilizing bi-cliques have been proposed and perform well in rather small datasets, all of them face challenges with scalability when dealing with large datasets since they demand substantial computational resources. This limits the practical utility of these approaches in real-world applications. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a novel approach employing iceberg concept lattices and the Transformer encoder. Our method requires fewer computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale datasets while maintaining high prediction performance. We conduct experiments on five large real-world datasets that exceed the capacity of previous bi-clique-based approaches to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Additionally, we perform supplementary experiments on five small datasets to compare with the previous bi-clique-based methods for bipartite link prediction and demonstrate that our method is more efficient than the previous ones.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Mental Health Issues Using Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, calls for immediate need in developing tools for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, like Reddit, represent a rich source of user-generated content, reflecting emotional and behavioral patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework that integrates linguistic and temporal features for early detection of mental health crises. Our approach is based on the method that utilizes a BiLSTM network both for text and temporal feature analysis, modeling sequential dependencies in a different manner, capturing contextual patterns quite well. This work includes a cross-modal attention approach that allows fusion of such outputs into context-aware classification of mental health conditions. The model was then trained and evaluated on a dataset of labeled Reddit posts preprocessed using text preprocessing, scaling of temporal features, and encoding of labels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture performs better compared to traditional models with a validation accuracy of 74.55% and F1-Score of 0.7376. This study presents the importance of multi-modal learning for mental health detection and provides a baseline for further improvements by using more advanced attention mechanisms and other data modalities.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and posterior sampling for network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction is the task of inferring the unseen interactions between elements of a system, based only on their behavior or dynamics. This inverse problem is in general ill-posed, and admits many solutions for the same observation. Nevertheless, the vast majority of statistical methods proposed for this task -- formulated as the inference of a graphical generative model -- can only produce a ``point estimate,'' i.e. a single network considered the most likely. In general, this can give only a limited characterization of the reconstruction, since uncertainties and competing answers cannot be conveyed, even if their probabilities are comparable, while being structurally different. In this work we present an efficient MCMC algorithm for sampling from posterior distributions of reconstructed networks, which is able to reveal the full population of answers for a given reconstruction problem, weighted according to their plausibilities. Our algorithm is general, since it does not rely on specific properties of particular generative models, and is specially suited for the inference of large and sparse networks, since in this case an iteration can be performed in time $O(N\log^2 N)$ for a network of $N$ nodes, instead of $O(N^2)$, as would be the case for a more naive approach. We demonstrate the suitability of our method in providing uncertainties and consensus of solutions (which provably increases the reconstruction accuracy) in a variety of synthetic and empirical cases.</description>

Abstract: The growing interest in hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) is driven by their capacity to capture the complex relationships and patterns within hypergraph structured data across various domains, including computer vision, complex networks, and natural language processing. This paper comprehensively reviews recent advances in HGNNs and presents a taxonomy of mainstream models based on their architectures: hypergraph convolutional networks (HGCNs), hypergraph attention networks (HGATs), hypergraph autoencoders (HGAEs), hypergraph recurrent networks (HGRNs), and deep hypergraph generative models (DHGGMs). For each category, we delve into its practical applications, mathematical mechanisms, literature contributions, and open problems. Finally, we discuss some common challenges and promising research directions.This paper aspires to be a helpful resource that provides guidance for future research and applications of HGNNs.</description>

      <title>Overlap-aware meta-learning attention to enhance hypergraph neural networks for node classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing complex datasets, their practical performance often remains limited. On one hand, existing networks typically employ a single type of attention mechanism, focusing on either structural or feature similarities during message passing. On the other hand, assuming that all nodes in current hypergraph models have the same level of overlap may lead to suboptimal generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, overlap-aware meta-learning attention for hypergraph neural networks (OMA-HGNN). First, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism that integrates both structural and feature similarities. Specifically, we linearly combine their respective losses with weighted factors for the HGNN model. Second, we partition nodes into different tasks based on their diverse overlap levels and develop a multi-task Meta-Weight-Net (MWN) to determine the corresponding weighted factors. Third, we jointly train the internal MWN model with the losses from the external HGNN model and train the external model with the weighted factors from the internal model. To evaluate the effectiveness of OMA-HGNN, we conducted experiments on six real-world datasets and benchmarked its perfor-mance against nine state-of-the-art methods for node classification. The results demonstrate that OMA-HGNN excels in learning superior node representations and outperforms these baselines.</description>

      <title>RouteKG: A knowledge graph-based framework for route prediction on road networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-term route prediction on road networks allows us to anticipate the future trajectories of road users, enabling various applications ranging from dynamic traffic control to personalized navigation. Despite recent advances in this area, existing methods focus primarily on learning sequential transition patterns, neglecting the inherent spatial relations in road networks that can affect human routing decisions. To fill this gap, this paper introduces RouteKG, a novel Knowledge Graph-based framework for route prediction. Specifically, we construct a Knowledge Graph on the road network to encode spatial relations, especially moving directions that are crucial for human navigation. Moreover, an n-ary tree-based algorithm is introduced to efficiently generate top-K routes in a batch mode, enhancing computational efficiency. To further optimize the prediction performance, a rank refinement module is incorporated to fine-tune the candidate route rankings. The model performance is evaluated using two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets from two Chinese cities under various practical scenarios. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy over baseline methods. We further validate the proposed method by utilizing the pre-trained model as a simulator for real-time traffic flow estimation at the link level. RouteKG holds great potential for transforming vehicle navigation, traffic management, and a variety of intelligent transportation tasks, playing a crucial role in advancing the core foundation of intelligent and connected urban systems.</description>

      <title>Decoding Echo Chambers: LLM-Powered Simulations Revealing Polarization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of social media on critical issues such as echo chambers needs to be addressed, as these phenomena can have disruptive consequences for our society. Traditional research often oversimplifies emotional tendencies and opinion evolution into numbers and formulas, neglecting that news and communication are conveyed through text, which limits these approaches. Hence, in this work, we propose an LLM-based simulation for the social opinion network to evaluate and counter polarization phenomena. We first construct three typical network structures to simulate different characteristics of social interactions. Then, agents interact based on recommendation algorithms and update their strategies through reasoning and analysis. By comparing these interactions with the classic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), the Friedkin Johnsen (FJ) model, and using echo chamber-related indices, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in simulating opinion dynamics and reproducing phenomena such as opinion polarization and echo chambers. We propose two mitigation methods, active and passive nudges, that can help reduce echo chambers, specifically within language-based simulations. We hope our work will offer valuable insights and guidance for social polarization mitigation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a model for describing advection dynamics on distance-weighted directed graphs. To this end we establish a set of key properties, or axioms, that a discrete advection operator should satisfy, and prove that there exists an essentially unique operator satisfying all such properties. Both infinite and finite networks are considered, as well as possible variants and extensions. We illustrate the proposed model through examples, both analytical and numerical, and we describe an application to the simulation of a traffic network.</description>

      <title>Learning Hypergraphs From Signals With Dual Smoothness Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph structure learning, which aims to learn the hypergraph structures from the observed signals to capture the intrinsic high-order relationships among the entities, becomes crucial when a hypergraph topology is not readily available in the datasets. There are two challenges that lie at the heart of this problem: 1) how to handle the huge search space of potential hyperedges, and 2) how to define meaningful criteria to measure the relationship between the signals observed on nodes and the hypergraph structure. In this paper, for the first challenge, we adopt the assumption that the ideal hypergraph structure can be derived from a learnable graph structure that captures the pairwise relations within signals. Further, we propose a hypergraph structure learning framework HGSL with a novel dual smoothness prior that reveals a mapping between the observed node signals and the hypergraph structure, whereby each hyperedge corresponds to a subgraph with both node signal smoothness and edge signal smoothness in the learnable graph structure. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HGSL on both synthetic and real world datasets. Experiments show that HGSL can efficiently infer meaningful hypergraph topologies from observed signals.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Structure Inference From Data Under Smoothness Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing hypergraph structure inference methods.</description>

      <title>Perfect Recovery for Random Geometric Graph Matching with Shallow Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the graph matching problem in the presence of vertex feature information using shallow graph neural networks. Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</description>

Abstract: Complex biological networks, encompassing metabolic reactions, gene interactions, and protein-protein interactions, often exhibit scale-free characteristics with power-law degree distributions. However, empirical evidence reveals significant deviations from ideal power-law fits, necessitating more flexible and accurate modeling approaches. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Compounded Burr (CBurr) distribution, a novel probability model derived from the Burr family, designed to capture the intricate structural properties of biological networks. We rigorously establish its statistical properties, including moment analysis, hazard functions, and tail behavior, and provide a robust parameter estimation framework using the maximum likelihood method. The CBurr distribution is broadly applicable to networks with fat-tailed degree distributions, making it highly relevant for modeling biological, social, and technological networks. To validate its efficacy, we conduct an extensive empirical study on large-scale biological network datasets, demonstrating that CBurr consistently outperforms conventional power-law and alternative heavy-tailed models in fitting the entire range of node degree distributions. Our proposed CBurr probability distribution holds great promise for accurately capturing the complex nature of biological networks and advancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13364</link>

Abstract: The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.</description>
