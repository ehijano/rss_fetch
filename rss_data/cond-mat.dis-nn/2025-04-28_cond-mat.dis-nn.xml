      <title>Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>DFT Investigations of Major Defects in Quartz Crystal: Implications for Luminescence and ESR Dosimetry and Dating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz is extensively used for luminescence and ESR dosimetry as well as dating. These techniques use inherent defects introduced in quartz crystal during its crystallization in nature. The defect comprises both intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects. These defects give important luminescence properties to quartz but are not yet well understood from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, in case of luminescence dosimetry the nature of traps and their involvement in luminescence production is not exactly known. Thus, present work attempts to understand the basic physics of defects and their implication for luminescence and ESR techniques via Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling. The work uses DFT to model the presence of some possible major impurities in quartz. Several interesting novel results are obtained that will have implications for ongoing research in Luminescence and ESR methods. The DFT modelling suggested that Oxygen deficiency in quartz crystal results in the formation of both electron and hole trapping centres. However, it is observed that these centres can be passivated by the introduction of charge compensating OH or H ions. Further, it is found that peroxy defects can be formed in the presence of either excess Oxygen or due to the absence of Silicon (Si4+), however, the nature of the traps formed in both cases is different. Besides these intrinsic defects, Al and Fe are the major impurities which are observed as defects in quartz. The modelling of these impurities suggested that negligible change in DOS is observed for Al defect and Fe generally forms a recombination centre or hole trap. In addition to these, there are several interesting first-time observations that are not reported and will be helpful for progressing luminescence and ESR dosimetry research.</description>

      <title>Predicting sampling advantage of stochastic Ising Machines for Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Ising machines, sIMs, are highly promising accelerators for optimization and sampling of computational problems that can be formulated as an Ising model. Here we investigate the computational advantage of sIM for simulations of quantum magnets with neural-network quantum states (NQS), in which the quantum many-body wave function is mapped onto an Ising model. We study the sampling performance of sIM for NQS by comparing sampling on a software-emulated sIM with standard Metropolis-Hastings sampling for NQS. We quantify the sampling efficiency by the number of steps required to reach iso-accurate stochastic estimation of the variational energy and show that this is entirely determined by the autocorrelation time of the sampling. This enables predications of sampling advantage without direct deployment on hardware. For the quantum Heisenberg models studied and experimental results on the runtime of sIMs, we project a possible speed-up of 100 to 10000, suggesting great opportunities for studying complex quantum systems at larger scales.</description>

      <title>Amending CALPHAD databases using a neural network for predicting mixing enthalpy of liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18366v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to establish the thermodynamic stability of a system, knowledge of its Gibbs free energy is essential. Most often, the Gibbs free energy is predicted within the CALPHAD framework using models employing thermodynamic properties, such as the mixing enthalpy, heat capacity, and activity coefficients. Here, we present a deep-learning approach capable of predicting the mixing enthalpy of liquid phases of binary systems that were not present in the training dataset. Therefore, our model allows for a system-informed enhancement of the thermodynamic description to unknown binary systems based on information present in the available thermodynamic assessment. Thereby, significant experimental efforts in assessing new systems can be spared. We use an open database for steels containing 91 binary systems to generate our initial training (and validation) and amend it with several direct experimental reports. The model is thoroughly tested using different strategies, including a test of its predictive capabilities. The model shows excellent predictive capabilities outside of the training dataset as soon as some data containing species of the predicted system is included in the training dataset. The estimated uncertainty of the model is below 1 kJ/mol for the predicted mixing enthalpy. Subsequently, we used our model to predict the enthalpy of mixing of all binary systems not present in the original database and extracted the Redlich-Kister parameters, which can be readily reintegrated into the thermodynamic database file.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent flow in inhomogeneous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the supercurrent flow pattern is altered by inhomogeneities in superconducting films. Working in the vicinity of the critical temperature and assuming a model of short-range disorder in the quadratic term of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, we develop a perturbation theory in the inhomogeneity strength. Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics. In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes. The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current. An inhomogeneous superflow will generate a random magnetic field, whose magnitude in thin NbN films can be comparable to Earth's magnetic field. We discuss the feasibility of detecting it using the SQUID-on-tip technique.</description>

      <title>Real-space chirality from crystalline topological defects in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain crystalline topological defects in the gapless Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid model generate a chirality and Majorana fermion orbital magnetization that depends in a universal manner on their emergent flux. Focusing on 5-7 dislocations as building blocks, consisting of pentagon and heptagon disclinations, we identify the Kitaev bond label configurations that preserve solvability. By computing two formulations of local markers $M(r)$ we find that the 5 and 7 lattice defects generate a real-space contribution to Chern number and an associated Majorana fermion orbital magnetization proportional to $M(r)$. The sign of the $M(r)$ contribution from each 5/7 defect, i.e. its $q_M=\pm 1$ chirality, is determined by the defect Frank angle sign $F$ and emergent gauge field flux $W = \pm i$ through the expression $q_M = - i F W$. Remarkably, though lattice curvature and torsion can interplay with the surrounding gapless background to modify the profile of $M(r)$, its sign $q_M$ is determined locally, implying that crystalline defects in the Kitaev spin liquid can generate a robust and observable chirality.</description>

      <title>Tensor Cross Interpolation of Purities in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defining feature of quantum many-body systems is the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of degrees of freedom. This exponential complexity na\"ively renders a complete state characterization, for instance via the complete set of bipartite Renyi entropies for all disjoint regions, a challenging task. Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by encoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as entanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a simple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity and practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature can be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the number of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We benchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming analytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of various one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates have entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible applications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the distance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal one-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the potential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.</description>
