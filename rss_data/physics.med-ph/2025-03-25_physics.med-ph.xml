      <title>TrackRAD2025 challenge dataset: Real-time tumor tracking for MRI-guided radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize anatomical motion is becoming increasingly important when treating cancer patients with radiotherapy. Hybrid MRI-linear accelerator (MRI-linac) systems allow real-time motion management during irradiation. This paper presents a multi-institutional real-time MRI time series dataset from different MRI-linac vendors. The dataset is designed to support developing and evaluating real-time tumor localization (tracking) algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy within the TrackRAD2025 challenge (https://trackrad2025.grand-challenge.org/).
  Acquisition and validation methods: The dataset consists of sagittal 2D cine MRIs in 585 patients from six centers (3 Dutch, 1 German, 1 Australian, and 1 Chinese). Tumors in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis acquired on two commercially available MRI-linacs (0.35 T and 1.5 T) were included. For 108 cases, irradiation targets or tracking surrogates were manually segmented on each temporal frame. The dataset was randomly split into a public training set of 527 cases (477 unlabeled and 50 labeled) and a private testing set of 58 cases (all labeled).
  Data Format and Usage Notes: The data is publicly available under the TrackRAD2025 collection: https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/4539. Both the images and segmentations for each patient are available in metadata format.
  Potential Applications: This novel clinical dataset will enable the development and evaluation of real-time tumor localization algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy. By enabling more accurate motion management and adaptive treatment strategies, this dataset has the potential to advance the field of radiotherapy significantly.</description>

      <title>Tumor monitoring and detection of lymph node metastasis using quantitative ultrasound and immune cytokine profiling in dogs undergoing radiation therapy: a pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) characterizes the composition of cells to distinguish diseased from healthy tissue. QUS can reflect the complexity of the tumor and detect early lymph node (LN) metastasis ex vivo. The objective in this study was to gather preliminary QUS and cytokine data from dogs undergoing radiation therapy and correlate QUS data with both LN metastasis and tumor response. Spontaneous solid tumors were evaluated with QUS before and up to one year after receiving RT. Additionally, regional LNs were evaluated with QUS in vivo, then excised and examined with histopathology to detect metastasis. Paired t-tests were used to compare QUS data of metastatic and non-metastatic LNs within patients. Furthermore, paired t-tests compared pre- versus post-RT QUS data. Serum was collected at each time point for cytokine profiles. Most statistical tests were underpowered to produce significant p values, but interesting trends were observed. The lowest p values for LN tests were found with the envelope statistics K (p = 0.142) and mu (p = 0.181), which correspond to cell structure and number of scatterers. For tumor response, the lowest p values were found with K (p = 0.115) and mu (p = 0.127) when comparing baseline QUS data with QUS data 1 week after RT. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) was significantly higher in dogs with cancer when compared to healthy controls (p = 1.12e-4). A weak correlation was found between effective scatterer diameter (ESD) and Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB-1). While statistical tests on the preliminary QUS data alone were underpowered to detect significant differences among groups, our methods create a basis for future studies.</description>

      <title>Cystic Lung Phantom to Validate Clinical CT Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In CT-based evaluation of the extent of cystic changes in the lungs of patients with cystic lung diseases, such as Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), there is a lack of a lung phantom containing air-filled cavities that mimic pulmonary cysts to calibrate the measurement of cystic volumes from CT scans. Here we describe a simple, easy-to-replicate cystic lung phantom consisting of basic structures of a trachea and two lung compartments. The lung compartments contain air cavities of varying sizes to mimic cystic lesions. The lung volumes are equal to those of typical adults. The lung compartments are made of a foam material recommended by NIST to simulate the radiodensity of human lung parenchyma. In tests performed on a clinical scanner using two types of lung analysis software, the various structures in the lung phantom were correctly recognized by the software. The re-sulting cystic volume measurements revealed the relationship between the size of the cysts and the accuracy of the measurement. A significant finding is that the volumes of individual cysts were underestimated for small cysts. The error increased with decreasing cyst sizes. Such underestimation has not been mentioned previously and de-serves the attention of clinicians using CT scans to assess the cyst burden in the lungs, particularly in patients presenting with numerous small pulmonary cysts.</description>

      <title>CTorch: PyTorch-Compatible GPU-Accelerated Auto-Differentiable Projector Toolbox for Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces CTorch, a PyTorch-compatible, GPU-accelerated, and auto-differentiable projector toolbox designed to handle various CT geometries with configurable projector algorithms. CTorch provides flexible scanner geometry definition, supporting 2D fan-beam, 3D circular cone-beam, and 3D non-circular cone-beam geometries. Each geometry allows view-specific definitions to accommodate variations during scanning. Both flat- and curved-detector models may be specified to accommodate various clinical devices. CTorch implements four projector algorithms: voxel-driven, ray-driven, distance-driven (DD), and separable footprint (SF), allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency based on their needs. All the projectors are primarily built using CUDA C for GPU acceleration, then compiled as Python-callable functions, and wrapped as PyTorch network module. This design allows direct use of PyTorch tensors, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch's auto-differentiation framework. These features make CTorch an flexible and efficient tool for CT imaging research, with potential applications in accurate CT simulations, efficient iterative reconstruction, and advanced deep-learning-based CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Imaging Intravoxel Vessel Size Distribution in the Brain Using Susceptibility Contrast Enhanced MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vascular remodelling is inherent to the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, fibrosis, hypertension, and diabetes. In this paper, a new susceptibility-contrast based MRI approach is established to non-invasively image intravoxel vessel size distribution (VSD), enabling a more comprehensive and quantitative assessment of vascular remodelling. The approach utilizes high-resolution light-sheet fluorescence microscopy images of rodent brain vasculature, simulating gradient echo sampling of free induction decay and spin echo (GESFIDE) MRI signals for the three-dimensional vascular networks, and training a deep learning model to predict cerebral blood volume (CBV) and VSD from GESFIDE signals. The results from ex vivo experiments demonstrated strong correlation (r = 0.96) between the true and predicted CBV. High similarity between true and predicted VSDs was observed (mean Bhattacharya Coefficient = 0.92). With further in vivo validation, intravoxel VSD imaging could become a transformative preclinical and clinical tool for interrogating disease and treatment induced vascular remodelling.</description>
