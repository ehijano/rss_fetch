      <title>GVMGen: A General Video-to-Music Generation Model with Hierarchical Attentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composing music for video is essential yet challenging, leading to a growing interest in automating music generation for video applications. Existing approaches often struggle to achieve robust music-video correspondence and generative diversity, primarily due to inadequate feature alignment methods and insufficient datasets. In this study, we present General Video-to-Music Generation model (GVMGen), designed for generating high-related music to the video input. Our model employs hierarchical attentions to extract and align video features with music in both spatial and temporal dimensions, ensuring the preservation of pertinent features while minimizing redundancy. Remarkably, our method is versatile, capable of generating multi-style music from different video inputs, even in zero-shot scenarios. We also propose an evaluation model along with two novel objective metrics for assessing video-music alignment. Additionally, we have compiled a large-scale dataset comprising diverse types of video-music pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that GVMGen surpasses previous models in terms of music-video correspondence, generative diversity, and application universality.</description>

      <title>HiFi-SR: A Unified Generative Transformer-Convolutional Adversarial Network for High-Fidelity Speech Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has recently advanced speech super-resolution (SR) based on intermediate representations like mel-spectrograms. However, existing SR methods that typically rely on independently trained and concatenated networks may lead to inconsistent representations and poor speech quality, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we propose HiFi-SR, a unified network that leverages end-to-end adversarial training to achieve high-fidelity speech super-resolution. Our model features a unified transformer-convolutional generator designed to seamlessly handle both the prediction of latent representations and their conversion into time-domain waveforms. The transformer network serves as a powerful encoder, converting low-resolution mel-spectrograms into latent space representations, while the convolutional network upscales these representations into high-resolution waveforms. To enhance high-frequency fidelity, we incorporate a multi-band, multi-scale time-frequency discriminator, along with a multi-scale mel-reconstruction loss in the adversarial training process. HiFi-SR is versatile, capable of upscaling any input speech signal between 4 kHz and 32 kHz to a 48 kHz sampling rate. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFi-SR significantly outperforms existing speech SR methods across both objective metrics and ABX preference tests, for both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios (https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio).</description>

      <title>Conditional Latent Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement Via Dual Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the application of diffusion probabilistic models has advanced speech enhancement through generative approaches. However, existing diffusion-based methods have focused on the generation process in high-dimensional waveform or spectral domains, leading to increased generation complexity and slower inference speeds. Additionally, these methods have primarily modelled clean speech distributions, with limited exploration of noise distributions, thereby constraining the discriminative capability of diffusion models for speech enhancement. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that integrates a conditional latent diffusion model (cLDM) with dual-context learning (DCL). Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) to compress mel-spectrograms into a low-dimensional latent space. We then apply cLDM to transform the latent representations of both clean speech and background noise into Gaussian noise by the DCL process, and a parameterized model is trained to reverse this process, conditioned on noisy latent representations and text embeddings. By operating in a lower-dimensional space, the latent representations reduce the complexity of the generation process, while the DCL process enhances the model's ability to handle diverse and unseen noise environments. Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed approach compared to existing diffusion-based methods, even with fewer iterative steps, and highlight the superior generalization capability of our models to out-of-domain noise datasets (https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio).</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Music Detection and its Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the face of a new era of generative models, the detection of artificially generated content has become a matter of utmost importance. In particular, the ability to create credible minute-long synthetic music in a few seconds on user-friendly platforms poses a real threat of fraud on streaming services and unfair competition to human artists. This paper demonstrates the possibility (and surprising ease) of training classifiers on datasets comprising real audio and artificial reconstructions, achieving a convincing accuracy of 99.8%. To our knowledge, this marks the first publication of a AI-music detector, a tool that will help in the regulation of synthetic media. Nevertheless, informed by decades of literature on forgery detection in other fields, we stress that getting a good test score is not the end of the story. We expose and discuss several facets that could be problematic with such a deployed detector: robustness to audio manipulation, generalisation to unseen models. This second part acts as a position for future research steps in the field and a caveat to a flourishing market of artificial content checkers.</description>

      <title>Towards An Integrated Approach for Expressive Piano Performance Synthesis from Music Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated system that transforms symbolic music scores into expressive piano performance audio. By combining a Transformer-based Expressive Performance Rendering (EPR) model with a fine-tuned neural MIDI synthesiser, our approach directly generates expressive audio performances from score inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to offer a streamlined method for converting score MIDI files lacking expression control into rich, expressive piano performances. We conducted experiments using subsets of the ATEPP dataset, evaluating the system with both objective metrics and subjective listening tests. Our system not only accurately reconstructs human-like expressiveness, but also captures the acoustic ambience of environments such as concert halls and recording studios. Additionally, the proposed system demonstrates its ability to achieve musical expressiveness while ensuring good audio quality in its outputs.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Rhythm and Voice Conversion of Dysarthric to Healthy Speech for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are well known to perform poorly on dysarthric speech. Previous works have addressed this by speaking rate modification to reduce the mismatch with typical speech. Unfortunately, these approaches rely on transcribed speech data to estimate speaking rates and phoneme durations, which might not be available for unseen speakers. Therefore, we combine unsupervised rhythm and voice conversion methods based on self-supervised speech representations to map dysarthric to typical speech. We evaluate the outputs with a large ASR model pre-trained on healthy speech without further fine-tuning and find that the proposed rhythm conversion especially improves performance for speakers of the Torgo corpus with more severe cases of dysarthria.

      <title>Audio-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Head-Orientation in Naturalistic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches in audio signal processing have seen substantial progress in recent years, audio-driven DRL for tasks such as navigation, gaze control and head-orientation control in the context of human-robot interaction have received little attention. Here, we propose an audio-driven DRL framework in which we utilise deep Q-learning to develop an autonomous agent that orients towards a talker in the acoustic environment based on stereo speech recordings. Our results show that the agent learned to perform the task at a near perfect level when trained on speech segments in anechoic environments (that is, without reverberation). The presence of reverberation in naturalistic acoustic environments affected the agent's performance, although the agent still substantially outperformed a baseline, randomly acting agent. Finally, we quantified the degree of generalization of the proposed DRL approach across naturalistic acoustic environments. Our experiments revealed that policies learned by agents trained on medium or high reverb environments generalized to low reverb environments, but policies learned by agents trained on anechoic or low reverb environments did not generalize to medium or high reverb environments. Taken together, this study demonstrates the potential of audio-driven DRL for tasks such as head-orientation control and highlights the need for training strategies that enable robust generalization across environments for real-world audio-driven DRL applications.</description>

      <title>MRI2Speech: Speech Synthesis from Articulatory Movements Recorded by Real-time MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous real-time MRI (rtMRI)-based speech synthesis models depend heavily on noisy ground-truth speech. Applying loss directly over ground truth mel-spectrograms entangles speech content with MRI noise, resulting in poor intelligibility. We introduce a novel approach that adapts the multi-modal self-supervised AV-HuBERT model for text prediction from rtMRI and incorporates a new flow-based duration predictor for speaker-specific alignment. The predicted text and durations are then used by a speech decoder to synthesize aligned speech in any novel voice. We conduct thorough experiments on two datasets and demonstrate our method's generalization ability to unseen speakers. We assess our framework's performance by masking parts of the rtMRI video to evaluate the impact of different articulators on text prediction. Our method achieves a $15.18\%$ Word Error Rate (WER) on the USC-TIMIT MRI corpus, marking a huge improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

      <title>Music Tagging with Classifier Group Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose music tagging with classifier chains that model the interplay of music tags. Most conventional methods estimate multiple tags independently by treating them as multiple independent binary classification problems. This treatment overlooks the conditional dependencies among music tags, leading to suboptimal tagging performance. Unlike most music taggers, the proposed method sequentially estimates each tag based on the idea of the classifier chains. Beyond the naive classifier chains, the proposed method groups the multiple tags by category, such as genre, and performs chains by unit of groups, which we call \textit{classifier group chains}. Our method allows the modeling of the dependence between tag groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for music tagging performance through music tagging experiments using the MTG-Jamendo dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the effective order of chains for music tagging.</description>

      <title>Joint Automatic Speech Recognition And Structure Learning For Better Speech Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a structure prediction task in the field of speech. Recently, many works on SLU that treat it as a sequence-to-sequence task have achieved great success. However, This method is not suitable for simultaneous speech recognition and understanding. In this paper, we propose a joint speech recognition and structure learning framework (JSRSL), an end-to-end SLU model based on span, which can accurately transcribe speech and extract structured content simultaneously. We conduct experiments on name entity recognition and intent classification using the Chinese dataset AISHELL-NER and the English dataset SLURP. The results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the traditional sequence-to-sequence method in both transcription and extraction capabilities but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the two datasets.</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-Shot Chinese-English Code-Switching ASR with kNN-CTC and Gated Monolingual Datastores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03814v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kNN-CTC model has proven to be effective for monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, its direct application to multilingual scenarios like code-switching, presents challenges. Although there is potential for performance improvement, a kNN-CTC model utilizing a single bilingual datastore can inadvertently introduce undesirable noise from the alternative language. To address this, we propose a novel kNN-CTC-based code-switching ASR (CS-ASR) framework that employs dual monolingual datastores and a gated datastore selection mechanism to reduce noise interference. Our method selects the appropriate datastore for decoding each frame, ensuring the injection of language-specific information into the ASR process. We apply this framework to cutting-edge CTC-based models, developing an advanced CS-ASR system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our gated datastore mechanism in enhancing the performance of zero-shot Chinese-English CS-ASR.</description>

      <title>Annealed Multiple Choice Learning: Overcoming limitations of Winner-takes-all with annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.</description>

      <title>How Redundant Is the Transformer Stack in Speech Representation Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech representation models, particularly those leveraging transformer architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and emotion detection. Recent studies on transformer models revealed a high redundancy between layers and the potential for significant pruning, which we will investigate here for transformer-based speech representation models. We perform a detailed analysis of layer similarity in speech representation models using three similarity metrics: cosine similarity, centered kernel alignment, and mutual nearest-neighbor alignment. Our findings reveal a block-like structure of high similarity, suggesting two main processing steps and significant redundancy of layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning transformer-based speech representation models without the need for post-training, achieving up to 40% reduction in transformer layers while maintaining over 95% of the model's predictive capacity. Furthermore, we employ a knowledge distillation method to substitute the entire transformer stack with mimicking layers, reducing the network size 95-98% and the inference time by up to 94%. This substantial decrease in computational load occurs without considerable performance loss, suggesting that the transformer stack is almost completely redundant for downstream applications of speech representation models.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Visual Contribution in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines auditory and visual speech cues to enhance the accuracy and robustness of speech recognition systems. Recent advancements in AVSR have improved performance in noisy environments compared to audio-only counterparts. However, the true extent of the visual contribution, and whether AVSR systems fully exploit the available cues in the visual domain, remains unclear. This paper assesses AVSR systems from a different perspective, by considering human speech perception. We use three systems: Auto-AVSR, AVEC and AV-RelScore. We first quantify the visual contribution using effective SNR gains at 0 dB and then investigate the use of visual information in terms of its temporal distribution and word-level informativeness. We show that low WER does not guarantee high SNR gains. Our results suggest that current methods do not fully exploit visual information, and we recommend future research to report effective SNR gains alongside WERs.</description>

Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) is ubiquitously used in training of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. DA offers increased data variability, robustness and generalization against different acoustic distortions. Recently, personalization of ASR models on mobile devices has been shown to improve Word Error Rate (WER). This paper evaluates data augmentation in this context and proposes persoDA; a DA method driven by user's data utilized to personalize ASR. persoDA aims to augment training with data specifically tuned towards acoustic characteristics of the end-user, as opposed to standard augmentation based on Multi-Condition Training (MCT) that applies random reverberation and noises. Our evaluation with an ASR conformer-based baseline trained on Librispeech and personalized for VOICES shows that persoDA achieves a 13.9% relative WER reduction over using standard data augmentation (using random noise &amp; reverberation). Furthermore, persoDA shows 16% to 20% faster convergence over MCT.</description>
