      <title>Hidden symmetries, hidden conservation laws and exact solutions of dispersionless Nizhnik equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among Lie submodels of the (real symmetric potential) dispersionless Nizhnik equation, we single out a remarkable submodel as such that, despite being the only one, is associated with a family of in general inequivalent one-dimensional subalgebras of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of this equation, which are parameterized by an arbitrary function of the time variable. The wide family of invariant solutions of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation that are related to the above submodel is expressed in terms of an arbitrary function of the time variable and the double quadrature of the well-known (implicit) general solution of the inviscid Burgers equation with respect to a space-like submodel invariant variable. The singled out submodel possesses many other interesting properties. In particular, we show that it is Lie-remarkable, and its maximal Lie invariance algebra completely defines its point symmetry pseudogroup, which provides the second but simpler example of the latter phenomenon in literature. Moreover, only hidden Lie symmetries of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation that are associated with this submodel are essential for finding its exact solutions. Using Lie reductions, we construct new families of exact solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nizhnik equation in closed or parametric form. We also exhaustively described generalized symmetries, cosymmetries and conservation laws of the submodel, which gives the corresponding nonlocal and hidden structures for the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nizhnik equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problem and long-time asymptotics to the combined Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa and short-pulse equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to the Cauchy problem for the combined Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa and short-pulse (WKI-SP) equation. The solution of the Cauchy problem is first expressed in terms of the solution of a RH problem with direct scattering transform based on the Lax pair. Further through a series of deformations to the RH problem by using the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of Deift-Zhou steepest descent method, we obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations to the solution of the WKI-SP equation under a new scale $(y,t)$ in three kinds of space-time regions. The first asymptotic result from the space-time regions $ \xi:=y/t &lt;-2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta}, \alpha\beta&gt;0$ and $|\xi|&lt;\infty,\alpha\beta&lt;0$ with saddle points on $\mathbb{R}$, is characterized with solitons and soliton-radiation interaction with residual error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. The second asymptotic result from the region $ \xi &gt;-2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta}, \alpha\beta&gt;0$ without saddle point on $\mathbb{R}$, is characterized with modulation-solitons with residual error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$; These two results above are a verification of the soliton resolution conjecture for the WKI-SP equation. The third asymptotic result from a transition region $\xi \approx -2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta},\alpha\beta&gt;0$ can be expressed in terms of the solution of the Painlev\'{e} \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} equation with error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$. This is a new phenomena that the long-time asymptotics for the solution to the Cauchy problem of the WKI equation and SP equation don't possesses.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave-mean flow interaction in strongly nonlineardispersive shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a solitary wave and a slowly varying mean background or flow for the Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations is studied using Whitham modulation theory. The exact form of the three SGN-Whitham modulation equations -- two for the mean horizontal velocity and depth decoupled from one for the solitary wave amplitude field -- are obtained exactly in the solitary wave limit. Although the three equations are not diagonalizable, the restriction of the full system to simple waves for the mean equations is diagonalized in terms of Riemann invariants. The Riemann invariants are used to analytically describe the head-on and overtaking interactions of a solitary wave with a rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave (DSW), leading to scenarios of solitary wave trapping or transmission by the mean flow. The analytical results for overtaking interactions prove that a simpler, approximate approach based on the DSW fitting method is accurate to the second order in solitary wave amplitude, beyond the first order accurate Korteweg-de Vries approximation. The analytical results also accurately predict the SGN DSW's solitary wave edge amplitude and speed. The analytical results are favourably compared with corresponding numerical solutions of the full SGN equations. Because the SGN equations model the bi-directional propagation of strongly nonlinear, long gravity waves over a flat bottom, the analysis presented here describes large amplitude solitary wave-mean flow interactions in shallow water waves.</description>

      <title>Joyce structures and poles of Painlev\'e equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joyce structures are a class of geometric structures that first arose in relation to Donaldson-Thomas theory. There is a special class of examples, called class $S[A_1]$, whose underlying manifold parameterises Riemann surfaces of some fixed genus equipped with a meromorphic quadratic differential with poles of fixed orders. We study two Joyce structures of this type using the isomonodromic systems associated to the Painlev\'e II and III$_3$ equations. We give explicit formulae for the Pleba\'nski functions of these Joyce structures, and compute several associated objects, including their tau functions, which we explicitly relate to the corresponding Painlev\'e tau functions. We show that the behaviour of the Joyce structure near the zero-section can be studied analytically through poles of Painlev\'e equations. The systematic treatment gives a blueprint for the study of more general Joyce structures associated to meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere.</description>

      <title>Two Layer Model via Non Quasi Periodic Normal Form Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two layer model is a 2+1/2 degrees of freedom non autonomous dynamical system whose lower order expansion exhibits capture in resonance, numerically detected in a previous paper by the authors. In this paper, we reframe the model along the lines of a suitable version of (which we refer to as non quasi periodic) normal form theory and provide an explicit amount of the resonance trapping time, which is estimated as exponentially long, in terms of the small parameters of the system. Key words: capture into resonance; non quasi periodic normal form theory; friction. MSC 2020: 37J40; 70F40.</description>

      <title>Blobbed topological recursion and KP integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revise the notion of the blobbed topological recursion by extending it to the setting of generalized topological recursion as well as allowing blobs which do not necessarily admit topological expansion. We show that the so-called non-perturbative differentials form a special case of this revisited version of blobbed topological recursion. Furthermore, we prove the KP integrability of the differentials of blobbed topological recursion for the input data that include KP-integrable blobs. This result generalizes, unifies, and gives a new proof of the KP integrability of nonperturbative differentials conjectured by Borot--Eynard and recently proved by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of universality have essential relevance for the theory of random matrices usually called the Wigner ensemble. The issue was analysed up to recent years with detailed and relevant results. We present a slightly different view and compare the large-$n$ limit of connected correlators of distinct ensembles: universality has steps or degrees, precisely counted by the number of probability moments of the matrix entries, which match among distinct ensembles.</description>

      <title>More accurate slow-roll approximations for inflation in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new versions of the slow-roll approximation for inflationary models with nonminimally coupled scalar fields. We derive more precise expressions for the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations, we consider inflationary models with the induced gravity term and the fourth-order monomial potential. For specific values of the model parameters, this model is the well-known Higgs-driven inflationary model. We investigate the inflationary dynamics in the Jordan frame and come to the conclusion that the proposed versions of the slow-roll approximation are not only more accurate at the end of inflation, but also give essentially more precise estimations for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and of the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$.</description>

      <title>Mock modularity at work, or black holes in a forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we will analyse a group of agents and their attitude to follow, or not, some rules. The model is based on some quantum-like ideas, and in particular on an Hamiltonian operator $H$ describing the dynamics of the agents, assuming they are driven by some mutual interactions and that they are subjected to an external source of "information" used by the agents to decide whether to obey or not these rules. We will discuss how the relative strengths of the parameters of $H$ determine this attitude and we will discuss in particular the role of the external information. We will also apply our general idea to a specific situation, involving drivers and pedestrians trying to cross a road.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider rigorous consequences of modular invariance for two-dimensional unitary non-rational CFTs with $c &gt; 1$. Simple estimates for the torus partition function can lead to remarkably strong results. We show in particular that the spectral density of spin-$J$ operators must grow like $\exp\left( \pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}(c-1) J} \right)/\sqrt{2J}$ in any twist interval at or above $(c-1)/12$, with a known twist-dependent prefactor. This proves that the large $J$ spectrum becomes dense even without averaging over spins. For twists below $(c-1)/12$ we establish that the growth must be strictly slower. Finally, we estimate how fast the maximal gap between two spin-$J$ operators must go to zero as $J$ becomes large.</description>

      <title>The Sky Remembers everything: Celestial amplitude, Shadow and OPE in quadratic EFT of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the celestial amplitude arising from higher curvature corrections to Einstein gravity, incorporating phase dressing. The inclusion of such corrections leads to effective modifications of the theory's ultraviolet (UV) behaviour. In the eikonal limit, we find that, in contrast to Einstein's gravity, where the $u$ and $s$-channel contributions cancel, these contributions remain non-vanishing in the presence of higher curvature terms. We examine the analytic structure of the resulting amplitude and derive a dispersion relation for the phase-dressed eikonal amplitude in quadratic gravity. Furthermore, we investigate the celestial conformal block expansion of the Mellin-transformed conformal shadow amplitude within the framework of celestial conformal field theory (CCFT). As a consequence, we compute the corresponding operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients using the Burchnall-Chaundy expansion. In addition, we evaluate the OPE via the Euclidean OPE inversion formula across various kinematic channels and comment on its applicability and implications. Finally, we briefly explore the Carrollian amplitude associated with the corresponding quadratic EFT.</description>

      <title>Direct Sum Structure of the Super Virasoro Algebra and a Fermion Algebra Arising from the Quantum Toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra can be constructed from a certain representation of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. In this paper, we apply the same construction to the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and study the properties of the resulting generators $W_i(z)$ ($i=1,2$). The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, we find that the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, whose degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$. We also establish the quadratic relations satisfied by the $W_i(z)$ and show that they generate a pair of commuting $q$-deformed Virasoro algebras, which degenerate into two nontrivial commuting Virasoro algebras included in $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$.</description>

      <title>RNS superstring measure for genus 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the RNS supersting measure for genus 3. Our derivation is based on invariant theory. We follow Witten's idea of using an algebraic parametrization of the moduli space (which he applied to re-derive D'Hoker and Phong's formula for the RNS superstring measure for genus 2); but the particular parametrization that we use has not been applied to superstring theory before. We prove that the superstring measure is a linear combinaition (with complex coefficients) of three known functions. Furthermore, we conjecture the values of the coefficients of this linear combination and provide evidence for this conjecture. Unlike the Ansatz of Cacciatori, Dalla Piazza and van Geemen from 2008, our formula has a polar singularity along the hyperelliptic locus; the existence of this singularity was established by Witten in 2015. Moreover, our formula is not an Ansatz but follows from first principles, except for the values of the three coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the spin-orbit problem for highly elliptical orbits and recursive excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examining the spin-orbit coupling effects for highly elliptical orbits is relevant to the mission design and operation of cislunar space assets, such as the Lunar Gateway. In high-eccentricity orbits, the gravity-gradient moment is here modelled as an instantaneous excitation at each periapsis passage. By approximating the gravity-gradient moment through Dirac pulses, we derive a recursive discrete map describing the rotational state of the satellite at the periapsis passage. Thanks to the recursive map, we are able to find the initial attitude corresponding to an unbounded growth of angular velocity, and to identify initial conditions whose evolution is such that the pulses have the same sign (in-phase condition) or the alternate sign (counterphase condition) at successive periapsis passages. In the recursive map, we perform the numerical analysis up to ten periapsis passages. In order to justify the introduction of the discrete map, we compare the results of the discrete map with those found in the spin-orbit problem. Because of numerical errors due to the high eccentricity, we restrict the investigation up to three periapsis passages in the spin-orbit problem. Moreover, we apply the Fast Lyapunov Indicators method to draw the phase portrait and detect the initial conditions fulfilling the counterphase condition.</description>

      <title>Analytic Expressions for Most $f^n$ Valence Multiplet Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well know that many full atomic multiplet codes are available for experimentalists to check x-ray absorption or emission spectra against known valence materials to identify effect valence configuration of transition metal ions as well as their ligands. This has grown recently with the continued development of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a general tool that can characterize orbital, spin, charge, and lattice excitations in quantum materials. In this note, I show that all multiplet eigenstates for most $f^n$ configurations can be obtained analytically. I correct prior misprints in the literature and present new results for $f$-electrons. These results can serve as checks against new and developed numerical codes, and further provide experimentalists with deeper insights into the many configurations probed by advanced x-ray spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extensions of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras and Conformal Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be one of the following unitary strongly-rational VOAs: unitary WZW models, discrete series W-algebras of type ADE, even lattice VOAs, parafermion VOAs, their tensor products, and their strongly-rational cosets. Let $U$ be a (unitary) VOA extension of $V$, described by a Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that $U$ is strongly local. Let $\mathcal A_V,\mathcal A_U$ be the conformal nets associated to $V,U$ in the sense of Carpi-Kawahigashi-Longo-Weiner (CKLW). We prove that $\mathcal A_U$ is canonically isomorphic to the conformal net extension of $\mathcal A_V$ defined by the Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that all unitary $U$-modules are strongly integrable in the sense of Carpi-Weiner-Xu (CWX). We show that the CWX $*$-functor from the $C^*$-category of unitary $U$-modules to the $C^*$-category of finite-index $\mathcal A_U$-modules is naturally isomorphic to $*$-functor defined by $Q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Calder{\'o}n's problem on a class of Sobolev extension domains containing non-Lipschitz and fractal shapes. We generalize the notion of Poincar{\'e}-Steklov (Dirichlet-to-Neumann) operator for the conductivity problem on such domains. From there, we prove the stability of the direct problem for bounded conductivities continuous near the boundary. Then, we turn to the inverse problem and prove its stability at the boundary for Lipschitz conductivities, which we use to identify such conductivities on the domain from the knowledge of the Poincar{\'e}-Steklov operator. Finally, we prove the stability of the inverse problem on the domain for W^{2,$\infty$} conductivities constant near the boundary. The last two results are valid in dimension n $\ge$ 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC; the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact value of the Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the local constancy of regularized superdeterminants along special families of differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the flat-regularized determinant of families of operators of the form $D_\tau=[\delta_\tau,d_\nabla]$, where $\tau\to\delta_\tau$ are families of degree $-1$ maps in the twisted de Rham complex $\left(\Omega^\bullet(M,E),d_\nabla\right)$ generalizing the (twisted) Hodge codifferential. We show that under suitable assumptions, both geometrical and analytical in nature, the flat-regularized determinant of $D_\tau$, restricted to the subspace $\mathrm{im}(\delta_\tau)$, is constant in $\tau$. The general result we present implies both local constancy of the Ray--Singer torsion and of the value at zero of the Ruelle zeta function for a contact Anosov flow, upon choosing $\delta_\tau = \delta_{g_\tau}$, the Hodge codifferential for a family of metrics, and $\delta_\tau=\iota_{X_\tau}$, the contraction along a family of (regular, contact) Anosov vector fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the strong unique continuation property for the Dirac operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [DO99,KY99], the strong unique continuation property from the origin is established for $H_{loc}^1$-solutions to the massless Dirac differential inequality $|{D}_n u | \leq \frac{C}{|x|}|u|$, in dimension $n\geq 2$ and with $C&lt;\frac12$. We show that $\frac12$ is the largest possibile constant in this result, providing an example in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of a (non-trivial) solution of the inequality. Also, we show properties of unique continuation from the origin for solutions to the inequality $|D_n u | \leq \frac{C}{ |x|^{\gamma}}|u|$, for $\gamma&gt;1$, $C&gt;0$. Finally, we establish the strong unique continuation property for the Dirac operator from the point at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) models. We depart from the fact that Lie groups with a bi-invariant galilean structure can be seen as the quotient by a null central subgroup of a generalised Nappi--Witten group. We implement the quotient by a chiral null gauging. We use a particular free field realisation of the Nappi--Witten current algebra to compute the Virasoro BRST cohomology of the gauged WZW model, resulting in a closed string theory reminiscent of the bosonic Gomis--Ooguri string, but whose spectrum differs slightly between the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors.</description>

      <title>A generalised non-linear reconstructor for all Fourier-type wavefront sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art adaptive optics (AO) systems perform non-linear Fourier-type wavefront sensing for real-time corrections of dynamic wavefront aberrations. This general class of sensors uses a filtering mask in the focal plane that converts phase fluctuations of the incoming light into intensity variations in the subsequent pupil plane. Due to their high sensitivity, Fourier-type wavefront sensors (WFSs) are the sensors of choice for many current and upcoming AO systems in ophthalmic imaging, free-space optical communications (FSOC) and astronomical ground-based telescopes such as the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs). Conventionally, linear methods, like a matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM), are used for the inversion of Fourier-type WFSs. However, their non-linear behavior gives rise to severe performance degradations when significant channel perturbations are observed. They are expected to occur during strong atmospheric turbulence conditions, which are commonplace for non-rural sites and daytime observations.
  This study presents a novel type of iterative reconstructor to overcome non-linear wavefront sensing regimes. The underlying method is the non-linear Landweber iteration with Nesterov acceleration, well known in the field of inverse problems. A significant advantage of the new approach is its direct applicability to any Fourier-type WFS. This is implemented by adapting the filtering mask of the specific Fourier-type WFSs in the model-based algorithm.
  Several Fourier-type wavefront sensors are considered for ELT-scale instruments and their performance with the new algorithm is compared. The study goes on to concentrate on the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS), one of the most well-known Fourier-type WFSs. We demonstrate in end-to-end simulations that this novel approach outperforms linear methods in non-linear sensing regimes.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic reduction of deep neural networks to linear models in the overparametrized proportional regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth in the Bayesian optimal setting in the so-called proportional scaling regime where the number of training samples and width of the input and all inner layers diverge proportionally. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the "deep Gaussian equivalence principle" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this "trivialisation" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained from much more data have to be considered.</description>

      <title>From Dirac Notation to Probability Bracket Notation: Time Evolution and Path Integral under Wick Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4816</link>
      <description>arXiv:0901.4816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we advance the development of the Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), a formalism inspired by Dirac's notation in quantum mechanics, to provide a unified framework for probability modeling. We demonstrate that under a Special Wick Rotation (SWR), an imaginary-time map, the Schr\"odinger equation, the transition amplitude, and its associated path integral in Dirac notation transform into the master equation, the transition probability, and its Euclidean path integral in the PBN, from which we can reproduce the master equation, representing induced micro-diffusion processes. By extending this approach through a General Wick Rotation (GWR) and employing an anti-Hermitian wave-number operator, we perform parallel derivations of path integrals in both the Dirac and PBN frameworks. This leads to the formulation of the Euclidean Lagrangian for induced diffusions and the strong-damping harmonic oscillator (described by the Smoluchowski diffusion equation). Our findings highlight the versatility of the PBN in bridging quantum mechanics and stochastic processes, offering a coherent notation system for analyzing time evolution and path integrals across these domains.</description>

We use different geometric descriptions to study the main properties and characteristics of these systems; such as their Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and unified formalisms, their symmetries, the variational principles, and others. The study is done mainly for the regular case, although some comments and explanations about singular systems are also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05839v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a connection between twisted spectral triples and pseudo-Riemannian spectral triples, rooted in the fundamental interplay between twists and Krein products. A concept of morphism of spectral triples is introduced, transforming one spectral triple into its dual. In the case of even-dimensional manifolds, we demonstrate how this construction implements a local signature change via the parity operator induced by the twist. Consequently, the signature change transformation is governed solely by the unitary operator that implements the twist. This unitary is a central element of our approach, as it is directly linked to the Krein product, the twist, and the parity operator that implements the signature change.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of F-cohomological field theories and F-topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define F-topological recursion (F-TR) as a non-symmetric version of topological recursion, which associates a vector potential to some initial data. We describe the symmetries of the initial data for F-TR and show that, at the level of the vector potential, they include the F-Givental (non-linear) symmetries studied by Arsie, Buryak, Lorenzoni, and Rossi within the framework of F-manifolds. Additionally, we propose a spectral curve formulation of F-topological recursion. This allows us to extend the correspondence between semisimple cohomological field theories (CohFTs) and topological recursion, as established by Dunin-Barkowski, Orantin, Shadrin, and Spitz, to the F-world. In the absence of a full reconstruction theorem \`a la Teleman for F-CohFTs, this demonstrates that F-TR holds for the ancestor vector potential of a given F-CohFT if and only if it holds for some F-CohFT in its F-Givental orbit. We turn this into a useful statement by showing that the correlation functions of F-topological field theories (F-CohFTs of cohomological degree 0) are governed by F-TR. We apply these results to the extended 2-spin F-CohFT. Furthermore, we exhibit a large set of linear symmetries of F-CohFTs, which do not commute with the F-Givental action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also recall that non-involutive solutions of the braid equation are obtained from shelf and rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all involutive set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the flip map via a parametric twist. The notion of braces is also presented as the suitable algebraic structure associated to involutive set-theoretic solutions. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability of Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is also discussed. The explicit form of the Drinfel'd twist is presented allowing the derivation of general set-theoretic solutions.</description>

This opens a new perspective on the Lorentzian signature problem, showing that the almost-commutative structure at the heart of the noncommutative standard model of particle physics could be the origin of the emergence of a Lorentzian spectral triple, starting from self-adjoint Dirac operators and conventional inner product structures, in the framework of twisted spectral triples. We present an alternative to Wick rotation, acting on the metric and the Christoffel symbols in a way that does not introduce any complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a local charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>Seat number configuration of the box-ball system, and its relation to the 10-elimination and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball system (BBS) is a soliton cellular automaton introduced in [TS], and it is known that the dynamics of the BBS can be linearized by several methods. Recently, a new linearization method, called the seat number configuration, is introduced in [MSSS]. The aim of this paper is fourfold. First, we introduce the $k$-skip map $\Psi_{k} : \Omega \to \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the state space of the BBS, and show that the $k$-skip map induces a shift operator of the seat number configuration. Second, we show that the $k$-skip map is a natural generalization of the $10$-elimination, which was originally introduced in [MIT] to solve the initial value problem of the periodic BBS. Third, we generalize the notions and results of the seat number configuration and the $k$-skip map for the BBS on the whole-line. Finally, we investigate the distribution of $\Psi_{k}(\eta), \eta \in \Omega$ when the distribution of $\eta$ belongs to a certain class of invariant measures of the BBS introduced in [FG]. As an application of the above results, we compute the expectation of the carrier with seat numbers.</description>

      <title>Collision of two solitons for $1d$ Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with the same mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12336v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to the one-dimensional models with polynomial odd nonlinearity having a stable soliton such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holomorphic modular bootstrap is an approach to classifying rational conformal field theories making use of the modular differential equations. In this paper we explore its flavored refinement. For a class of chiral algebras, we propose constraints on a special null state, which determine the structure of the algebra, and through flavored modular differential equations and quasi-modularity, completely fix the spectra in both the untwisted and twisted sector. Using the differential equations, we reveal hidden structures among null states of the chiral algebras under the modular group action and translation related to spectral flow.</description>

      <title>Sylvester-Preconditioned Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Advection-Diffusion Equations with Variable Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the adaptive-rank integration of {2D and 3D} time-dependent advection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with variable coefficients. We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal schemes. The discrete equation is a generalized Sylvester equation (GSE), which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: {(i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective preconditioner for the reduced coefficient matrix, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. {The low-rank decomposition is performed in 2D using SVD, and with high-order SVD (HOSVD) in 3D to represent the tensor in a compressed Tucker format.} The computational complexity of the proposed approach {is demonstrated numerically to} be comparable to the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J. Comput. Phys., 518 (2024)], scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N {r^2} + {r^{d+1}})$ for $d$-dimensional problems (here, $d = 2$ or $3$), with $N$ the resolution in one dimension and $r$ the maximal rank during the Krylov iteration (which we find to be largely independent of $N$). We present numerical examples that illustrate the computational efficacy and complexity of our algorithm.}</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the exact Fourier dimensions of all standard sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit interval, thereby confirming the Garban-Vargas conjecture. The proof relies on a significant improvement of the vector-valued martingale method, initially developed by Chen-Han-Qiu-Wang in the studies of the Fourier dimensions of Mandelbrot cascade random measures.</description>

      <title>On turbulence for spacetimes with stable trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of spacetimes admitting stably trapped null geodesics, such as ultracompact objects and black string solutions to general relativity, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear scalar waves on a simple (fixed) model geometry with stable trapping. More specifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the cubic (defocusing) wave equation on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon sphere.
  Our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar dynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of solutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously proven to remain uniformly bounded and to decay uniformly in time. However, due to the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help elucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave equation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting to axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics, we exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with turbulent behaviour: Within the region of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order energies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we numerically evolve, with the growth being induced by a direct energy cascade.
  As a complement to the numerical analysis, we provide a heuristic argument suggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave perturbations of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity, it would likely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Schwinger's non-commutative coordinates and duality between helicity and Dirac quantisation conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions, and the spin operator ceases to be defined properly and consistently. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase factor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when a 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantisation of massless particle's helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the helicity and the Dirac quantisation conditions. The relation for the minimal space cell volume, similar to the minimal phase-space cell of Heisenberg is suggested.</description>
