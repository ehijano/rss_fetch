      <title>On-chip probabilistic inference for charged-particle tracking at the sensor edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern scientific instruments operate under increasingly extreme constraints on bandwidth, latency, and power. Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area. Our results establish a path toward probabilistic inference directly at the edge, opening new opportunities for intelligent sensing in high-rate scientific instruments.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Daily Modulation in Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent modulation of the event rate in dark matter direct detection experiments, arising from the motion of the Earth with respect to the Galactic rest frame, is a distinctive signature whose observation is crucial for claiming a discovery of dark matter. While annual modulation has been well studied for decades, daily modulation due to the Earth's rotation has attracted increased attention recently due to the identification of anisotropic solid-state detector materials that yield a direction-dependent scattering rate without sacrificing the overall rate. We perform a statistical analysis of daily modulation in dark matter scattering experiments, with the goal of maximizing the statistical significance of a modulating signal in the presence of an unknown background rate, which may be either flat (non-modulating), or modulating over a 24-hour period with a known or unknown phase. In the background-dominated regime, we find that the discovery significance scales as $f_\text{RMS} \sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the total exposure time and $f_\text{RMS}$ is the root-mean-square modulation amplitude; in particular, the significance continues to improve with exposure rather than saturating due to systematic uncertainties in the background rate. Using anisotropic trans-stilbene detectors for sub-GeV dark matter as a benchmark example, we provide prescriptions for optimizing the significance for a given total detector mass and location. In an example analysis using three detectors, optimizing the detector orientations can reduce the required exposure by a factor of $\sim 5$ for a desired discovery or exclusion significance, even after profiling over an unknown modulating background phase.</description>

      <title>Memristive tabular variational autoencoder for compression of analog data in high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of edge AI to compress data on an in-memory analog content-addressable memory (ACAM) device. A variational autoencoder is trained on a simulated sample of energy measurements from incident high-energy electrons on a generic three-layer scintillator-based calorimeter. The encoding part is distilled into tabular format by regressing the latent space variables using decision trees, which is then programmed on a memristor-based ACAM. In real-time, the ACAM compresses 48 continuously valued incoming energies measured by the calorimeter sensors into the latent space, achieving a compression factor of 12x, which is transmitted off-detector for decompression. The performance result of the ACAM, obtained using the Structural Simulation Toolkit, the SST open source framework, gives a latency value of 24 ns and a throughput of 330M compressions per second, i.e., 3 ns between successive inputs, and an average energy consumption of 4.1 nJ per compression.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Production of Kaons on the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the electromagnetic production of strange quarks began in the 1950s as something of a curiosity that puzzled experimentalists and theorists alike. As the datasets increased, concomitant advances in theoretical models were realized. A paradigm shift occurred in the 1990s with the development of second-generation facilities at ELSA, MAMI, SPring-8, and JLab, which brought nuclear physics experiments forward by orders of magnitude in counting statistics compared to the first-generation efforts. This was an utter boon to strangeness physics investigations, and to date, more than 50 dedicated experiments in kaon photo- and electroproduction have been completed at facilities around the world, leading to a host of experimental observables that have enabled significant advances in the exploration of strongly interacting systems that decay via $s\bar{s}$ quark pair creation. This review was designed to provide the first-ever in-depth overview of both the experimental and theoretical progress in the field of the electromagnetic production of strangeness. This work looks back over 70 years of past developments, discusses ongoing work and near-term plans, and details future possibilities being considered for third-generation facilities. Throughout this work, the primary impacts of these explorations are highlighted, along with connections to a wide range of related phenomenological applications. An important goal of this review is to provide a complete, self-contained guide into this field prepared at a level that is relevant for both new and seasoned scientists, whether experimentalists, phenomenologists, or theorists, to better understand what has been accomplished by so many dedicated folks-each building on what has come before-and to appreciate the exciting future potential for continued studies in this area. A more complete abstract is provided in the paper.</description>

      <title>Is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory Enough for Higgs Pair Production?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Higgs-boson pair production in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) up to dimension six and in the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at leading order in the effective theory expansion, and assess which description is appropriate in concrete UV scenarios. Motivated by "Loryon"-inspired models, we compare the Higgs pair production cross sections predicted by the full models to their SMEFT and HEFT counterparts. We identify regimes in which the two EFTs provide comparable descriptions, and clarify the limits required for their couplings to match. We also find that, for parts of parameter space in some of these models, HEFT can reproduce Higgs pair production more accurately than SMEFT, highlighting di-Higgs measurements as a potential probe of non-linear electroweak dynamics.</description>

      <title>Characterization of an MPPC-Based Scintillator Telescope and Measurement of Cosmic Muon Angular Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents the design, characterization, and application of a high-sensitivity optical detection system based on plastic scintillators coupled to Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs). The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\bm{\cos^n(\theta)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\bm{n = 1.44 \pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the MPPC-scintillator coupling for precise photon counting and timing applications in high-energy physics instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-body decays $B^+\to D_s^+ (R\to) K^+K^-$ in the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A search for the decay $B^+\to D_s^+ K^+K^-$ has been reported by the LHCb Collaboration using $pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $4.8\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, collected at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13~TeV, in which no amplitude analysis of the $K^+K^-$ subsystem was performed. In this work, we study the resonant contributions to the decay $B^+\to D_s^+ K^+K^-$ within the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization framework. Contributions from the $S$-wave resonances $f_0(980)$, $f_0(1370)$, and $f_0(1500)$, the $P$-wave resonance $\phi(1020)$, and the $D$-wave resonances $f_2(1270)$ and $f_2(1525)$ are taken into account. By introducing the corresponding two-meson distribution amplitudes for the $K^+K^-$ system, we perform a complete perturbative analysis of the quasi-two-body decays $B^+\to D_s^+(R\to)K^+K^-$, where $R$ denotes an intermediate resonance, and present the first PQCD predictions for the associated branching fractions. Using the narrow-width approximation, we further extract the branching fractions of the corresponding two-body decays $B^+\to D_s^+R$. Our results are consistent with the available experimental measurements and previous theoretical studies. Finally, we find that direct CP asymmetries vanish for these quasi-two-body decays within the Standard Model, so that any experimentally observed nonzero CP asymmetry would constitute a clear signal of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Neutrino Charged-Current Interactions at Large Liquid-Scintillator Detectors: I. Physics of Neutrino-Antineutrino Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic study of the event characteristics and physics of neutrino-antineutrino discrimination associated with atmospheric neutrino charged-current interactions in large liquid scintillator detectors. This study encompasses the primary neutrino interactions, the sequential second interactions of final-state particles, and the final neutron captures. We carefully investigate the properties of final-state charged leptons and hadrons, providing distinct distributions of inelasticity and captured neutron multiplicity for both neutrino and antineutrino interactions. These distributions are employed to assess the quantitative performance of neutrino-antineutrino discrimination. Our findings lay the groundwork for atmospheric neutrino oscillation studies in large liquid scintillator detectors, particularly in the determination of neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation Theory Limits in Neutrino Oscillation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) neutrino mixing parameters have entered a precision era, enabling increasingly stringent tests of neutrino oscillations. Within the framework of quantum estimation theory, we investigate whether flavor measurements, the only observables currently accessible experimentally, are optimal for extracting the oscillation parameters. We compute the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the classical Fisher Information (FI) associated with ideal flavor projections for all oscillation parameters, considering accelerator muon (anti)neutrino and reactor electron antineutrino beams propagating in vacuum. Two main results emerge. First, flavor measurements saturate the QFI at the first oscillation maximum for $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{12}$, demonstrating their information-theoretic optimality for these parameters. In contrast, they are far from optimal for $\delta_{CP}$. In particular, only a small fraction of the available information on $\delta_{CP}$ is extracted at the first maximum; the sensitivity improves at the second maximum, in line with the strategy of ESS$\nu$SB, a planned facility. Second, the QFI associated with $\delta_{CP}$ is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the mixing angles, indicating that the neutrino state intrinsically encodes less information about CP violation. Nevertheless, this quantum bound lies well below current experimental uncertainties, implying that the present precision on $\delta_{CP}$ is not fundamentally limited. Our results provide a quantitative framework to disentangle fundamental from practical limitations and establish a benchmark for optimizing future neutrino facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how target geometry and material influence pion and muon production from an 8 GeV proton beam, in support of target-system design for a muon collider demonstrator. A 2 m long, 0.7 m radius solenoid with a 5 T peak magnetic field is used to capture secondary particles, with the target positioned at its center. We examine how variations in target radius, length, and material affect secondary-beam yield and emittance at the solenoid exit. In parallel, we evaluate temperature rise within the target to assess material limitations and guide future work on thermal and structural survivability. The results provide initial intuition for optimizing both particle yield and target durability in muon collider front-end systems.</description>

Abstract:   Most of the known literature on Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) is based on earliest theoretical attempts and later approximations led by F.C.Jones and J.B.Blumenthal. We found an independent and more general analytical procedure which provide both relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits for ICS. These new analytical expressions can be derived in a straightforward way and they contain the previously reminded Jones' results. Our detailed solutions may be probed by already existing as well future ICS experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Axions Revealed via Amplified Modulation of Ellipticity of Laser (CARAMEL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new axion dark matter detection strategy that employs optical readout of laser-beam ellipticity modulations caused by axion-induced electric fields in a microwave cavity, using electro-optic (EO) crystals, enhanced by externally injected radio-frequency (rf) power. Building upon the variance-based probing method~\cite{Omarov_2023}, we extend this concept to the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal coupled to the resonant microwave cavity field at cryogenic temperatures, and the axion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The injected rf signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field, amplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity. While our EO-based method employs a Fabry-P\'erot resonator, we do not require Michelson interferometers. Our method hence enables compact, high-frequency axion searches across the $0.5$--$50\,\mathrm{GHz}$ range. Operating at cryogenic temperatures not only suppresses thermal backgrounds but, critically, allows the probing method to mitigate quantum noise. This approach offers a scalable path forward for axion detection over the $\sim(\text{few}--200)\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ mass range -- covering the preferred parameter space for post-inflationary Peccei--Quinn axion dark matter -- using compact, tunable systems. \noindent Published in \textit{Phys.

      <title>Diffusion of $^{210}\text{Pb}$ and $^{210}\text{Po}$ in Nylon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radon and its progeny constitute a major source of background in rare-event physics experiments, such as those searching for dark matter, neutrinos, and neutrinoless double beta decay, due to their origin as unavoidable decay products of natural uranium. In particular, $^{222}$Rn and its long-lived daughter $^{210}$Pb can diffuse from detector material surfaces, resulting in sustained background contributions. To investigate this process, a system was developed using a controlled radon source, a vacuum chamber with a high electric field, and a thin Nylon-6 film to enable deposition of radon progeny onto the film surface. Nylon-6 was selected for the initial measurement given its history in low-background experiments. We intend to systematically study diffusion in various polymers in the future. Our setup allowed for controlled study of the diffusion behavior of $^{210}$Pb and its daughter $^{210}$Po under varying humidity conditions. Our results show that both $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Po diffuse significantly in nylon under high relative humidity, which can potentially lead to internal contamination and increased background in low-background detectors. The diffusivity of $^{210}$Pb was found to be lower than 1.14 $\times$ 10$^{-15}$ cm$^2$/s at 40$\%$ relative humidity (RH), and to be (4.03 $\pm$ 1.01) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$/s at 95$\%$ RH. The diffusivity of $^{210}$Po at 95$\%$ RH was measured to be (3.94 $\pm$ 0.98) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$/s. These findings underscore the importance of controlling environmental humidity and material exposure to radon in the design of ultra-low background experiments.</description>

Abstract: Searches are presented for $B_{c}^{+} \to D h^+ h^-$ decays, where $D$ is a charmed meson and $h^{\pm}$ is a charged pion or kaon, using $pp$ collision data collected by the LHCb experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9~\text{fb}^{-1}$. The decays $B_c^+\to D^+ K^+\pi^-$, $B_c^+\to D^{*+} K^+\pi^-$ and $B_c^+\to D_s^+ K^+ K^-$ are observed for the first time. Their branching fractions, expressed as ratios relative to that of the $B_c^+\to B_s^0\pi^+$ decay, are determined to be \begin{align*} \mathcal{R}(B_c^+\to D^+ K^+\pi^-) =(1.96 \pm 0.23\pm 0.08 \pm 0.10)\times 10^{-3},&amp;\\ \mathcal{R}(B_c^+\to D^{*+} K^+\pi^-) =(3.67 \pm 0.55 \pm 0.24\pm 0.20)\times 10^{-3},&amp;\\ \mathcal{R}(B_c^+\to D_s^+ K^+ K^-) =(1.61 \pm 0.35\pm 0.13\pm 0.07)\times 10^{-3}, \end{align*} where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is due to the limited precision on the $D$-meson branching fractions. The decay channels proceed primarily through excited $K^0$ or $D^0$ resonances or $\phi$ mesons, and open a new avenue for studies of charge-parity violation in beauty mesons.</description>

      <title>Dielectron production in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11995</link>

Abstract: The first measurements of dielectron production at midrapidity ($|\eta_{\rm e}|&lt;0.8$) in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV at the LHC are presented. The dielectron cross section is measured with the ALICE detector as a function of the invariant mass $m_{\rm{ee}}$ and the pair transverse momentum $p_{\rm{T,ee}}$ in the ranges $m_{\rm{ee}}$ &lt; 3.5 GeV/$c^{2}$ and $p_{\rm{T,ee}}$ &lt; 8.0 GeV/$c^{2}$, in both collision systems. In proton-proton collisions, the charm and beauty cross sections are determined at midrapidity from a fit to the data with two different event generators. This complements the existing dielectron measurements performed at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 13 TeV. The slope of the $\sqrt{s}$ dependence of the three measurements is described by FONLL calculations. The dielectron cross section measured in proton-lead collisions is in agreement, within the current precision, with the expected dielectron production without any nuclear matter effects for $\rm{e}^{+}\rm{e}^{-}$ pairs from open heavy-flavor hadron decays. For the first time at LHC energies, the dielectron production in proton-lead and proton-proton collisions are directly compared at the same $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ via the dielectron nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm{pPb}}$.

      <title>Common femtoscopic hadron-emission source in pp collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The femtoscopic study of pairs of identical pions is particularly suited to investigate the effective source function of particle emission, due to the resulting Bose-Einstein correlation signal. In small collision systems at the LHC, pp in particular, the majority of the pions are produced in resonance decays, which significantly affect the profile and size of the source. In this work, we explicitly model this effect in order to extract the primordial source in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV from charged $\pi - \pi$ correlations measured by ALICE. We demonstrate that the assumption of a Gaussian primordial source is compatible with the data and that the effective source, resulting from modifications due to resonances, is approximately exponential, as found in previous measurements at the LHC. The universality of hadron emission in pp collisions is further investigated by applying the same methodology to characterize the primordial source of K$-$p pairs. The size of the primordial source is evaluated as a function of the transverse mass ($m_{\rm T}$) of the pairs, leading to the observation of a common scaling for both $\pi - \pi$ and K$-$p, suggesting a collective effect. Further, the present results are compatible with the $m_{\rm T}$ scaling of the p$-$p and p$-\Lambda$ primordial source measured by ALICE in high multiplicity pp collisions, providing additional evidence for the presence of a common emission source for all hadrons in small collision systems at the LHC. This will allow the determination of the source function for any hadron-hadron pairs with high precision, granting access to the properties of the possible final-state interaction among pairs of less abundantly produced hadrons, such as strange or charmed particles.</description>

      <title>EFT at JADE: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As we use the standard model effective field theory to search for signs of new physics beyond the direct reach of the LHC, we often wonder what we may learn from the effective field theory, and what it would look like to make a discovery via effective field theory. This article presents a case study that provides some answers to these questions. We apply the low-energy effective field theory to $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-$ data below the Z boson mass from the JADE experiment at DESY. The low-energy effective field theory allows the observation of physics beyond QED in the JADE data and furthermore, by matching the Wilson coefficients to the electroweak theory, a rough measurement of the masses of the W and Z bosons is possible. The ability to make this rough measurement challenges the conventional wisdom that an observation of new physics via EFT tells us nothing about the nature of that new physics. A measurement of this quality would have been sufficient to guide the construction of colliders such as the super proton-antiproton synchrotron or the large electron-positron collider, and so we anticipate that a discovery of new physics via effective field theory at the LHC would be similarly sufficient to guide the construction of future colliders.</description>

      <title>Measurement of isolated prompt photon production in pp and p-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the measurement of the isolated prompt photon inclusive production cross section in pp and p-Pb collisions by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The measurement is performed in p-Pb collisions at centre-of-mass energies per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV and $8.16$ TeV, as well as in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV and $8$ TeV. The cross section is obtained at midrapidity $(|y|&lt;0.7)$ using a charged-track based isolation momentum $p_{\rm T}^{\rm{iso, ch}} &lt; 1.5$ GeV/$c$ in a cone with radius $R=0.4$. The data for both collision systems are well reproduced by perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) using recent parton distribution functions for free (PDF) and bound (nPDF) nucleons. Furthermore, the nuclear modification factor $R_{\text{pA}}$ for both collision energies is consistent with unity for $p_{\rm T} &gt; 20$ GeV/$c$. However, deviations from unity ($R_{\rm pA}&lt;1$) of up to 20% are observed for $p_{\rm T} &lt; 20$ GeV/$c$ with limited significance, indicating the possible presence of nuclear effects in the initial state of the collision. The suppression increases with decreasing \pt with a significance of $2.3\sigma$ for a non-zero slope and yields $R_{\rm pA}&lt;1$ with a significance of $1.8\sigma$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 8.16$ TeV for $p_{\rm T} &lt; 20$ GeV/$c$. In addition, a significance of $1.1\sigma$ is observed for $R_{\rm pA}&lt;1$ at the lower collision energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV for $p_{\rm T} &lt; 14$ GeV/$c$. The magnitude and shape of the suppression are consistent with pQCD predictions at NLO using nPDFs that incorporate nuclear shadowing effects in the Pb nucleus.</description>

      <title>Observation of deuteron and antideuteron formation from resonance-decay nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy hadronic collisions generate environments characterized by temperatures above 100 MeV [1,2], about 100,000 times hotter than the center of the Sun. It is therefore currently unclear how light (anti)nuclei with mass number A of a few units, such as the deuteron, $^3$He, or $^4$He, each bound by only a few MeV, can emerge from these collisions [3,4]. The ALICE collaboration reports that deuteron-pion momentum correlations in proton-proton (pp) collisions provide model-independent evidence that about 90% of the observed (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear reactions [5] following the decay of short-lived resonances, such as the $\Delta (1232)$. These findings, obtained by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) resolve a gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in ultra-relativistic hadronic collisions. Beyond offering insights on how (anti)nuclei are formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be employed in the modeling of the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays [6] and dark matter decays [7,8].</description>

      <title>Linearly Polarized Photon Fusion as a Precision Probe of the Tau Lepton Dipole Moments at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ($a_\tau$) and electric dipole moment ($d_\tau$) of the $\tau$ lepton using the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ process at future lepton colliders, with the Super Tau-Charm Facility serving as a benchmark. By employing transverse-momentum-dependent factorization, we introduce novel observables derived from $\cos2\phi$, $\sin2\phi$, and $\cos4\phi$ azimuthal asymmetries to precisely probe the $\tau$ lepton's electromagnetic structure. Our analysis significantly enhances the precision of $a_\tau$ constraints within the photon-photon fusion process, yielding $\mathrm{Re}(a_\tau) \in [-4.6, 7.0] \times 10^{-3}$ at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, which approaches the precision of the Standard Model prediction. These findings highlight the considerable potential of azimuthal asymmetry measurements for high-precision determinations of fundamental particle properties at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>$\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ production in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum spectra and integrated yields of anti-$\Sigma$ hyperons ($\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$) have been measured in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE experiment. Measurements are performed via the newly accessed decay channel $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm} \rightarrow {\rm\overline{n}}\pi^{\pm}$. A new method of antineutron reconstruction with the PHOS electromagnetic spectrometer is developed and applied to this analysis. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ are measured in the range $0.5 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 3$ GeV/$c$ and compared to predictions of the PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. The EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models provide the best descriptions of the measured spectra both in pp and p-Pb collisions, while models which do not account for multiparton interactions provide a considerably worse description at high $p_{\rm T}$. The total yields of $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ in both pp and p-Pb collisions are compared to predictions of the Thermal-FIST model and dynamical models PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4. All models reproduce the total yields in both colliding systems within uncertainties. The nuclear modification factors $R_\mathrm{pPb}$ for both $\overline{\Sigma}^{+}$ and $\overline{\Sigma}^{-}$ are evaluated and compared to those of protons, $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ hyperons, and predictions of EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. No deviations of $R_\mathrm{pPb}$ for $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ from the model predictions or measurements for other hadrons are found within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of f$_0$(980) production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dependence of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production on the final-state charged-particle multiplicity is reported for proton-proton (pp) collisions at the centre-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The production of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) is measured with the ALICE detector via the $\mathrm{f}_0 (980) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel in a midrapidity region of $|y|&lt;0.5$. The evolution of the integrated yields and mean transverse momentum of f$_{0}$(980) as a function of charged-particle multiplicity measured in pp at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV follows the trends observed in pp at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. Particle yield ratios of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) to $\pi^{\pm}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ are found to decrease with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. These particle ratios are compared with calculations from the canonical statistical thermal model as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. The thermal model calculations provide a better description of the decreasing trend of particle ratios when no strange or antistrange quark composition for f$_{0}$(980) is assumed, which suggests that the data do not support significant hidden strangeness in the f$_{0}$(980).</description>

      <title>$\Sigma^{+}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of $\Sigma^{+}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV is presented. The measurement is performed at midrapidity in both minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The $\Sigma^{+}$ is reconstructed via its weak-decay topology in the decay channel $\Sigma^{+} \rightarrow \rm{p} + \pi^{0}$ with $\pi^{0} \rightarrow \gamma + \gamma$. In a novel approach, the neutral pion is reconstructed by combining photons that convert in the detector material with photons measured in the calorimeters. The transverse-momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distributions of the $\Sigma^{+}$ and its rapidity densities ${\rm d}N$/${\rm d}y$ in both event classes are reported. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectrum in minimum-bias collisions is compared to QCD-inspired event generators. The ratio of $\Sigma^{+}$ to previously measured $\Lambda$ baryons is in good agreement with calculations from the Statistical Hadronization Model. The high efficiency and purity of the novel reconstruction method for $\Sigma^{+}$ presented here will enable future studies of the interaction of $\Sigma^{+}$ with protons in the context of femtoscopic measurements, which could be crucial for understanding the equation of state of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.</description>

      <title>KANEL\'E: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient LUT-based Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency, resource-efficient neural network inference on FPGAs is essential for applications demanding real-time capability and low power. Lookup table (LUT)-based neural networks are a common solution, combining strong representational power with efficient FPGA implementation. In this work, we introduce KANEL\'E, a framework that exploits the unique properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for FPGA deployment. Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs employ learnable one-dimensional splines with fixed domains as edge activations, a structure naturally suited to discretization and efficient LUT mapping. We present the first systematic design flow for implementing KANs on FPGAs, co-optimizing training with quantization and pruning to enable compact, high-throughput, and low-latency KAN architectures. Our results demonstrate up to a 2700x speedup and orders of magnitude resource savings compared to prior KAN-on-FPGA approaches. Moreover, KANEL\'E matches or surpasses other LUT-based architectures on widely used benchmarks, particularly for tasks involving symbolic or physical formulas, while balancing resource usage across FPGA hardware. Finally, we showcase the versatility of the framework by extending it to real-time, power-efficient control systems.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon: status and perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the status of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as a precision probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) after the release of the final results from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Muon $g-2$ experiment and the second White Paper of the Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative. While the SM prediction requires further improvements by a factor of four to fully leverage the sensitivity achieved in experiment, the FNAL measurement will set the standard for many years to come, and we discuss a variety of features of the experimental campaign that made this achievement possible. In going forward, we discuss current efforts to improve the SM prediction, and imagine how an experiment would have to be devised to surpass 124 ppb in precision.</description>
