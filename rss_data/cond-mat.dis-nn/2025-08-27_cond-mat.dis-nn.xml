      <title>Half-Quantized Hall Metal and Marginal Metal in Disordered Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semimagnetic topological insulator -- a heterostructure combining a topological insulator with a ferromagnet -- exhibits a half-quantized Hall effect, characterized by a quantized Hall conductance of $\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2}}{h}$ (where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant), which reinforces the established understanding of topological phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, its stability in realistic, disordered systems remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the robustness of the half-quantized Hall effect in weakly disordered systems, stemming from a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions and coexisting with weak antilocalization due to the $\pi$ Berry phase that suppresses backscattering. Furthermore, we uncover a marginal metallic phase emerging between weak antilocalization and Anderson insulation -- a transition that defies conventional metal-insulator transitions by lacking an isolated critical point -- where both conductance and normalized localization length exhibit scale invariance, independent of system size. The half-quantized Hall metal and the marginal metallic phase challenge existing localization theories and provide insights into disorder-driven topological phase transitions in magnetic topological insulators, opening avenues for exploring quantum materials and next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-value Probabilistic Computing with current-controlled Skyrmion Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic systems are highly promising for implementing probabilistic computing paradigms because of the fitting energy scales and conspicuous non-linearities. While conventional binary probabilistic computing has been realized, implementing more advantageous multi-value probabilistic computing (MPC) remains a challenge. Here, we report the realization of MPC by leveraging the thermally activated diffusion of magnetic skyrmions through an effectively non-flat energy landscape defined by a discrete number of pinning sites. The time-averaged spatial distribution of the diffusing skyrmions directly realizes a discrete probability distribution, which is tunable by current-generated spin-orbit torques, and can be quantified by non-perturbative electrical measurements. Even a very straightforward implementation with global tuning, already allows us to demonstrate the softmax computation - a core function in artificial intelligence. As a key advance, we demonstrate invertible logic without the need to create a network of probabilistic devices, offering major scalability advantages. Our proof of concept can be generalized to multiple skyrmions and can accommodate multiple locally tunable inputs and outputs using magnetic tunnel junctions, potentially enabling the representation of highly complex distribution functions.</description>

      <title>On-chip wave chaos for photonic extreme learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in demand for scalable and energy efficient artificial neural networks has put the focus on novel hardware solutions. Integrated photonics offers a compact, parallel and ultra-fast information processing platform, specially suited for extreme learning machine (ELM) architectures. Here we experimentally demonstrate a chip-scale photonic ELM based on wave chaos interference in a stadium microcavity. By encoding the input information in the wavelength of an external single-frequency tunable laser source, we leverage the high sensitivity to wavelength of injection in such photonic resonators. We fabricate the microcavity with direct laser writing of SU-8 polymer on glass. A scattering wall surrounding the stadium operates as readout layer, collecting the light associated with the cavity's leaky modes. We report uncorrelated and aperiodic behavior in the speckles of the scattering barrier from a high resolution scan of the input wavelength. Finally, we characterize the system's performance at classification in four qualitatively different benchmark tasks. As we can control the number of output nodes of our ELM by measuring different parts of the scattering barrier, we demonstrate the capability to optimize our photonic ELM's readout size to the performance required for each task.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian transport in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>
