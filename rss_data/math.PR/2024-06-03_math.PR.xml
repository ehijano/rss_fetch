      <title>Orderly divergence of Levy Gamma integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Orderly divergence'' deals with limit theorems for weighted stochastic Gamma integrals of otherwise nonintegrable functions. Although for monotonic functions this category usually coincides with the classical notion of weighted limit theorems for sums of i.i.d. random variables but there are exceptions and the lack of monotonicity reveals new aspects that are absent in the discrete case.</description>

      <title>Condensation in scale-free geometric graphs with excess edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the upper large deviation probability for the number of edges in scale-free geometric random graph models as the space volume goes to infinity. Our result covers the models of scale-free percolation, the Boolean model with heavy-tailed radius distribution, and the age-dependent random connection model. In all these cases the mechanism behind the large deviation is based on a condensation effect. Loosely speaking, the mechanism randomly selects a finite number of vertices and increases their power, so that they connect to a macroscopic number of vertices in the graph, while the other vertices retain a degree close to their expectation and thus make no more than the expected contribution to the large deviation event. We verify this intuition by means of limit theorems for the empirical distributions of degrees and edge-lengths under the conditioning. We observe that at large finite volumes, the edge-length distribution splits into a bulk and travelling wave part of asymptotically positive proportions.</description>

      <title>On the principal eigenvalue for compound Poisson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the explicit expression for the principal eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}^{X}(D)$ for a large class of compound Poisson processes $X$ on a bounded open set $D$ by examining its spectral heat content. When the jump density of the compound Poisson process is radially symmetric and strictly decreasing, we demonstrate that balls are the unique minimizers for $\lambda_{1}^{X}(D)$ among all sets with equal Lebesgue measure. Furthermore, we show that this uniqueness fails if the jump density is not strictly decreasing.</description>

      <title>Strong propagation of chaos for systems of interacting particles with nearly stable jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ interacting particles, described by SDEs driven by Poisson random measures, where the coefficients depend on the empirical measure of the system. Every particle jumps with a jump rate depending on its position. When this happens, all the other particles of the system receive a small random kick which is distributed according to a heavy tailed random variable belonging to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha-$ stable law and scaled by $N^{-1/\alpha},$ where $0 &lt; \alpha &lt;2 .$ We call these jumps collateral jumps. Moreover, in case $ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1, $ the jumping particle itself undergoes a macroscopic, main jump. Such systems appear in the modeling of large neural networks, such as the human brain.
  The particular scaling of the collateral jumps implies that the limit of the empirical measures of the system is random and equals the conditional distribution of one typical particle in the limit system, given the source of common noise. Thus the system exhibits the conditional propagation of chaos property. The limit system turns out to be solution of a non-linear SDE, driven by an $ \alpha-$stable process. We prove strong unique existence of the limit system and introduce a suitable coupling to obtain the strong convergence of the finite to the limit system, together with precise error bounds for finite time marginals.</description>

      <title>Stability in quadratic variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of cadlag processes $\{X^n\}_n$, and some fixed function $f$. If $f$ is continuous then under several modes of convergence $X^n\to X$ implies corresponding convergence of $f(X^n)\to f(X)$, due to continuous mapping. We study conditions (on $f$, $\{X^n\}_n$ and $X$) under which convergence of $X^n\to X$ implies $\left[f(X^n)-f(X)\right]\to 0$. While interesting in its own right, this also directly relates (through integration by parts and the Kunita-Watanabe inequality) to convergence of integrators in the sense $\int_0^t Y_{s-}df(X^n_s)\to\int_0^t Y_{s-}df(X_s)$. We use two different types of quadratic variations, weak sense and strong sense which our two main results deal with. For weak sense quadratic variations we show stability when $f\in C^1$, $\{X^n\}_n,X$ are Dirichlet processes defined as in \cite{NonCont} $X^n\xrightarrow{a.s.}X$, $[X^n-X]\xrightarrow{a.s.}0$ and $\{(X^n)^*_t\}_n$ is bounded in probability. For strong sense quadratic variations we are able to relax the conditions on $f$ to being the primitive function of a cadlag function but with the additional assumption on $X$, that the continuous and discontinuous parts of $X$ are independent stochastic processes (this assumption is not imposed on $\{X^n\}_n$ however), and $\{X^n\}_n,X$ are Dirichlet processes with quadratic variations along any stopping time refining sequence. To prove the result regarding strong sense quadratic variation we prove a new It\^o decomposition for this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the weak convergence rate of density-dependent stochastic differential equations with bounded drift driven by $\alpha$-stable processes with $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The well-posedness of these equations has been previously obtained in \cite{wu2023well}. We derive an explicit convergence rate in total variation for the Euler-Maruyama scheme, employing a technique rooted in \cite{hao2023}.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Computing Convergence Rates of Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence rate analysis for general state-space Markov chains is fundamentally important in areas such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and algorithmic analysis (for computing explicit convergence bounds). This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.</description>

      <title>On the randomized Euler scheme for SDEs with integral-form drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of strong approximation of the solution of SDEs in the case when the drift coefficient is given in the integral form. Such drift often appears when analyzing stochastic dynamics of optimization procedures in machine learning problems. We discuss connections of the defined randomized Euler approximation scheme with the perturbed version of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. We investigate its upper error bounds, in terms of the discretization parameter n and the size M of the random sample drawn at each step of the algorithm, in different subclasses of coefficients of the underlying SDE. Finally, the results of numerical experiments performed by using GPU architecture are also reported.</description>

      <title>Robust Decentralized Control of Coupled Systems via Risk Sensitive Control of Decoupled or Simple Models with Measure Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems with local information involve problems where multiple agents and subsystems which are coupled via dynamics and/or cost are present. Typically, however, the dynamics of such couplings is complex and difficult to precisely model, leading to questions on robustness in control design. Additionally, when such a coupling can be modeled, the problem arrived at is typically challenging and non-convex, due to decentralization of information. In this paper, we develop a robustness framework for optimal decentralized control of interacting agents, where we show that a decentralized control problem with interacting agents can be robustly designed by considering a risk-sensitive version of non-interacting agents/particles. This leads to a tractable robust formulation where we give a bound on the value of the cost function in terms of the risk-sensitive cost function for the non-interacting case plus a term involving the ``strength" of the interaction as measured by relative entropy. We will build on Gaussian measure theory and an associated variational equality. A particular application includes mean-field models consisting of (a generally large number of) interacting agents which are often hard to solve for the case with small or moderate numbers of agents, leading to an interest in effective approximations and robustness. By adapting a risk-sensitivity parameter, we also robustly control a non-symmetrically interacting problem with mean-field cost by one which is symmetric with a risk-sensitive criterion, and in the limit of small interactions, show the stability of optimal solutions to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Locally Stationary Distributions: A Framework for Analyzing Slow-Mixing Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural Markov chains fail to mix to their stationary distribution in polynomially many steps. Often, this slow mixing is inevitable since it is computationally intractable to sample from their stationary measure.
  Nevertheless, Markov chains can be shown to always converge quickly to measures that are *locally stationary*, i.e., measures that don't change over a small number of steps. These locally stationary measures are analogous to local minima in continuous optimization, while stationary measures correspond to global minima.
  While locally stationary measures can be statistically far from stationary measures, do they enjoy provable theoretical guarantees that have algorithmic implications? We study this question in this work and demonstrate three algorithmic applications of locally stationary measures:
  1. We show that Glauber dynamics on the hardcore model can be used to find independent sets of size $\Omega\left(\frac{\log d}{d} \cdot n\right)$ in triangle-free graphs of degree at most $d$.
  2. Let $W$ be a symmetric real matrix with bounded spectral diameter and $v$ be a unit vector. Given the matrix $M = \lambda vv^\top + W$ with a planted rank-one spike along vector $v$, for sufficiently large constant $\lambda$, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the vector $v$.
  3. Let $M = A_{\mathbf{G}} - \frac{d}{n}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\top$ be a centered version of the adjacency matrix where the graph $\mathbf{G}$ is drawn from a sparse 2-community stochastic block model.
  We show that for sufficiently large constant $\lambda$, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the hidden community vector $\mathbf{\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>Interfaces of the two-dimensional voter model in the context of SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates various geometrical properties of interfaces of the two-dimensional voter model. Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits dual characteristics, resembling both a critical system with long-range correlations, while also showing a tendency towards order similar to the Ising-Glauber model at zero temperature. This duality is reflected in the geometrical properties of its interfaces, which are examined here from the perspective of Schramm-Loewner evolution. Recent studies have delved into the geometrical properties of these interfaces within different lattice geometries and boundary conditions. We revisit these findings, focusing on a system within a box of linear size $L$ with Dobrushin boundary conditions, where values of the spins are fixed to either $+1$ or $-1$ on two distinct halves of the boundary, in order to enforce the presence of a pinned interface with fixed endpoints (or chordal interface). We also expand the study to compare the geometrical properties of the interfaces of the voter model with those of the critical Ising model and other related models. Scaling arguments and numerical studies suggest that, while locally the chordal interface of the voter model has fractal dimension $d_{\rm f}=3/2$, corresponding to a parameter $\kappa=4$, it becomes straight at large scales, confirming a conjecture made by Holmes et al \cite{holmes}, and ruling out the possibility of describing the chordal interface of the voter model by SLE$_{\kappa}$, for any non zero value of $\kappa$. This contrasts with the critical Ising model, which is described by SLE$_3$, and whose interface fluctuations remain of order $L$, and more generally with related critical models, which are in the same universality class.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on Large Deviations of Dirichlet $L$-functions in the $q$-aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a result on the large deviations of the central values of even primitive Dirichlet $L$-functions with a given modulus. For $V\sim \alpha\log\log q$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, we show that \begin{equation}\nonumber\frac{1}{\varphi(q)} \# \left\{\chi \text{ even, primitive mod }q: \log \left|L\left(\chi,\frac{1}{2}\right)\right| &gt;V\right\}\ll \frac{e^{-\frac{V^2}{\log\log q}}}{\sqrt{\log\log q}}.\end{equation} This yields the sharp upper bound for the fractional moments of central values of Dirichlet $L$-functions proved by Gao, upon noting that the number of even, primitive characters with modulus $q$ is $\frac{\varphi(q)}{2}+O(1).$ The proof is an adaptation to the $q$-aspect of the recursive scheme developed by Arguin, Bourgade and Radziwill for the local maxima of the Riemann zeta function, and applied by Arguin and Bailey to the large deviations in the $t$-aspect. We go further and get bounds on the case where $V=o(\log\log q)$. These bounds are not expected to be sharp, but the discrepancy from the Central Limit Theorem estimate grows very slowly with $q$. The method involves a formula for the twisted mollified second moment of central values of Dirichlet $L$-functions, building on the work of Iwaniec and Sarnak.</description>

      <title>Uniform Spanning Tree in Topological Polygons, Partition Functions for SLE(8), and Correlations in $c=-2$ Logarithmic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find explicit SLE(8) partition functions for the scaling limits of Peano curves in the uniform spanning tree (UST) in topological polygons with general boundary conditions. They are given in terms of Coulomb gas integral formulas, which can also be expressed in terms of determinants involving a-periods of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. We also identify the crossing probabilities for the UST Peano curves as ratios of these partition functions. The partition functions are interpreted as correlation functions in a logarithmic conformal field theory (log-CFT) of central charge $c= -2$. Indeed, it is clear from our results that this theory is not a minimal model and exhibits logarithmic phenomena -- the limit functions have logarithmic asymptotic behavior, that we calculate explicitly. General fusion rules for them could also be inferred from the explicit formulas. The discovered algebraic structure matches the known Virasoro staggered module classification, so in this sense, we give a direct probabilistic construction for correlation functions in a log-CFT of central charge $-2$ describing the UST model.</description>

      <title>Connection Probabilities of Multiple FK-Ising Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the scaling limits of a general class of boundary-to-boundary connection probabilities and multiple interfaces in the critical planar FK-Ising model, thus verifying predictions from the physics literature. We also discuss conjectural formulas using Coulomb gas integrals for the corresponding quantities in general critical planar random-cluster models with cluster-weight $q \in [1,4)$. Thus far, proofs for convergence, including ours, rely on discrete complex analysis techniques and are beyond reach for other values of $q$ than the FK-Ising model ($q=2$). Given the convergence of interfaces, the conjectural formulas for other values of $q$ could be verified similarly with relatively minor technical work. The limit interfaces are variants of $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$ curves (with $\kappa = 16/3$ for $q=2$). Their partition functions, that give the connection probabilities, also satisfy properties predicted for correlation functions in conformal field theory (CFT), expected to describe scaling limits of critical random-cluster models. We verify these properties for all $q \in [1,4)$, thus providing further evidence of the expected CFT description of these models.</description>

      <title>A multitype Galton-Watson model for rejuvenating cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the framework of multitype Galton-Watson processes to model a population of dividing cells. The cellular type is represented by its biological age, defined as the count of harmful proteins hosted by the cell. The stochastic evolution of the biological age of a cell is modeled as a discrete Markov chain with a finite state space $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, where $n$ signifies the absorbing state corresponding to the senescent state of the cell. Consequently, the set of individual types in the multitype Galton-Watson process becomes $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$. In our setting, a dividing cell may undergo rejuvenation meaning that its biological ages reduces due to transfer of harmful proteins to the daughter cell. For the proposed model, we define and study several biologically meaningful features, such as rejuvenation states, expected replicative lifespan, population growth rate, stable biological age distribution, and the population average of the biological age.</description>

      <title>Tournaments and random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between tournaments and random walks. This connection was first observed by Erd\H{o}s and Moser. Winston and Kleitman came close to showing that $S_n=\Theta(4^n/n^{5/2})$. Building on this, and works by Tak\'acs, these asymptotic bounds were confirmed by Kim and Pittel.
  In this work, we verify Moser's conjecture that $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$, using limit theory for integrated random walk bridges. Moreover, we show that $C$ can be described in terms of random walks. Combining this with a recent proof and number-theoretic description of $C$ by the second author, we obtain an analogue of Louchard's formula, for the Laplace transform of the squared Brownian excursion/Airy area measure. Finally, we describe the scaling limit of random score sequences, in terms of the Kolmogorov excursions, studied recently by B\"{a}r, Duraj and Wachtel.
  Our results can also be interpreted as answering questions related to a class of random polymers, which began with influential work of Sina\u{i}. From this point of view, our methods yield the precise asymptotics of a persistence probability, related to the pinning/wetting models from statistical physics, that was estimated up to constants by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, as conjectured by Caravenna and Deuschel.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Sina\u{i} excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of random polymers, introduced by Sina\u{i}, which are related to persistence probabilities in integrated simple random walk bridges. We find the precise asymptotics of these probabilities, and describe their combinatorics, using limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions, and the number-theoretic subset counting formulas of von Sterneck from the early 1900s. Our results sharpen estimates by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, and respond to a conjecture of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the pinning/wetting models, for random linear chains exhibiting entropic repulsion. Our key combinatorial result is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape is a black noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is a black noise in the sense of Tsirelson and Vershik. As a corollary, we show that for any microscopic system in which the height profile converges in law to the directed landscape, the driving noise is asymptotically independent of the height profile. This decoupling result provides one answer to the question of what happens to the driving noise in the limit under the KPZ scaling, and illustrates a type of noise sensitivity for systems in the KPZ universality class. Such decoupling and sensitivity phenomena are not present in the intermediate-disorder or weak-asymmetry regime, thus illustrating a contrast from the weak KPZ scaling regime. Along the way, we prove a strong mixing property for the directed landscape on a bounded time interval under spatial shifts, with a mixing rate $\alpha(N)\leq Ce^{-dN^3}$ for some $C,d&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Decoupling and Multipoint moments for the Inverse of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the decoupling structure and multipoint moment of the inverse of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos. It is also the second part of preliminary work for extending the work in "Random conformal weldings" (by K. Astala, P. Jones, A. Kupiainen, E. Saksman) to the existence of Lehto welding for the inverse. In particular, we prove that the dilatation of the inverse homeomorphism on the positive real line is in $L^{1}([0,1]\times[0,2])$.</description>

      <title>Zeros of the Brownian Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we firstly answer to a question raised by Khoshnevisan in \cite[Open Problem 4]{khoshnevisan2007slices} by proving that almost surely there is no projection of big enough rank changing the Hausdorff dimension of the zeros of the Brownian sheet. Secondly, we prove that almost surely for every projection whose rank isn't matching the aforementioned condition, the projection of the zero set is the entirety of the projective space. Key words: Brownian sheet, zeros set, Hausdorff dimension, orthogonal projection.</description>

      <title>An excursion onto Schr\"odinger's bridges: Stochastic flows with spatio-temporal marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following Schr\"odinger's dictum, by incorporating termination (killing) of stochastic flows. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</description>
