      <title>Differentiable quantum-trajectory simulation of Lindblad dynamics for QGP transport-coefficient inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parameter estimation for the transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma by differentiating open-quantum-system-based Monte Carlo simulations of quarkonium suppression. The underlying simulator requires solving a Lindblad equation in a large Hilbert space, which makes parameter estimation computationally expensive. We approach the problem using gradient-based optimization. Specifically, we apply the score-function gradient estimator to differentiate through discrete jump sampling in the Monte Carlo wave-function algorithm used to solve the Lindblad equation. The resulting stochastic gradient estimator exhibits sufficiently low variance and can still be estimated in an embarrassingly parallel manner, enabling efficient scaling of the simulations. We implement this gradient estimator in the existing open-source quarkonium suppression code QTraj. To demonstrate its utility for parameter estimation, we infer the two transport coefficients $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ using gradient-based optimization on synthetic nuclear modification factor data.</description>

      <title>FEcMD: A multi-physics and multi-scale computational program for dynamic coupling molecular dynamics simulations with transient electric field and heat conduction in metal nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field emission coupled with molecular dynamics simulation (FEcMD) software package is a computational tool for studying atomic structure evolution, structural deformation, phase transitions, recrystallization as well as electron emission characteristics of micro- and nano-protrusions and nanowires consisting of elemental metals or multi-component alloys by means of multi-physics and multi-scale methodology. Current implementations of molecular dynamics simulation coupled with multi-scale electrodynamics (ED) and heat conduction (HC) in FEcMD program are advanced mainly in the two aspects as follows. In electrodynamics, the FEcMD program incorporates the space charge interactions (space charge potential and exchange-correlation effects) in the self-consistent solved Poisson-Schr\"odinger equation with Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) approximation to evaluate the field emission current density and the related resistive heating process more reliably for nanowires or nano-protrusions especially for nano-gaps between two metal electrodes. Meanwhile, the two-temperature heat conduction model is implemented in electrodynamics coupled with molecular dynamics simulations (ED-MD), providing more dedicated descriptions for the hierarchical electron-phonon two-channel heat conduction mechanism and the temperature evolutions of electron and phonon subsystems under the radiofrequency (RF) or pulse electric fields. Benchmark tests are performed for some key implementations in FEcMD software to validate the numerical results, and also to demonstrate the use of program to study the atomic structure evolution of metal nano-structures under electric field and heating processes.</description>

      <title>GPU Acceleration and Portability of the TRIMEG Code for Gyrokinetic Plasma Simulations using OpenMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of plasma physics heavily relies on simulations to model various phenomena, such as instabilities, turbulence, and nonlinear behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to study from a purely theoretical approach. Simulations are fundamental in accurately setting up experiments, which can be extremely costly and complex. As high-fidelity tools, gyrokinetic simulations play a crucial role in discovering new physics, interpreting experimental results, and improving the design of next-generation devices. However, their high computational costs necessitate the use of acceleration platforms to reduce execution time. This work revolves around the TRIangular MEsh based Gyrokinetic (TRIMEG) code, which performs high-accuracy particle-in-cell plasma simulations in tokamak geometries, leveraging a novel finite element approach. The rise of graphical processing units (GPUs) constitutes an occasion to satisfy such computational needs, by offloading the most expensive portion of the code to the accelerators. The chosen approach features GPU offloading with the OpenMP API, which grants portability of the code to different architectures, namely AMD and NVIDIA. The particle pushing as well as the grid-to-particle operations have been ported to GPU platforms. Compiler limitations had to be overcome, and portions of the code were restructured to be suitable for GPU acceleration. Kernel performance was evaluated by carrying out GPU grid size exploration, as well as scalability studies. In addition, the efficiency of hybrid MPI-OpenMP offloading parallelization was assessed. The speedup of the GPU implementation was calculated by comparing it with the pure CPU version using different rationales. The Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) mode was simulated using the GPU-accelerated version, and its correctness was verified in terms of the energy growth rate and the two-dimensional mode structures.</description>

      <title>Variance Reduction in the Fokker-Planck Particle Method for Rarefied Gases using Quasi-Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck (FP) particle method accelerates rarefied-gas simulations by replacing the binary collisions of the commonly used Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with a drift=diffusion process. Like all particle methods, the FP method is inherently stochastic, which leads to statistical fluctuations in macroscopic quantities and necessitates large particle numbers for accurate results. In this work, we investigate the use of quasi-random numbers, which sample distributions more evenly and thereby reduce the variance. To preserve the low-discrepancy structure across time steps, we employ the Array Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo (Array-RQMC) technique. We combine the FP method with Array-RQMC and compare it in homogeneous and inhomogeneous problems with other commonly used variance-reduction techniques. The proposed FP-Array-RQMC approach achieves improved convergence rates compared with pseudo-random sampling and yields smaller estimator errors for sufficiently large particle numbers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDRoSIS is an automated MATLAB-Python software suite for the segmentation and quantification of lipid droplets (LDs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fluorescence microscopy images of irradiated A549 and MCF7 cells exposed to gold-based nanoparticles. It combines classical image processing algorithms with statistical post-analysis through a companion Python tool, StatLysis. The platform enables reproducible, high-throughput analysis of morphological and spectral parameters linked to nanoparticle-enhanced radiobiological responses. By bridging imaging and quantitative analytics, LiDRoSIS provides a robust framework for nanomedicine and radiation biology research.</description>

      <title>QDK/Chemistry: A Modular Toolkit for Quantum Chemistry Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present QDK/Chemistry, a software toolkit for quantum chemistry workflows targeting quantum computers. The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic. This paper describes the design philosophy, current capabilities, and role of QDK/Chemistry as a foundation for reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network for phase-field method in three-phase flow with phase change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to simulate multiphase flows, yet they are limited in modeling phase changes and sharp interfaces due to optimization conflicts in the strongly coupled Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations and the intrinsic smoothness bias of neural representations near discontinuities. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) based on the phase-field method to resolve sharp interfaces and phase changes in multiphase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware network architecture to mitigate spectral bias and automatically detect and model sharp interfacial dynamics, and a learnable local artificial viscosity term to stabilize the calculation near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are employed to reduce long-horizon errors and mitigate gradient conflicts, ensuring accurate capture of phase changes. Numerical experiments on two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems demonstrate that DPINN accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics, while conventional PINNs fail to converge. The method is further extended and tested in a three-phase droplet-icing case, where the viscosity and density ratios between ice, water, and air exceed seven and three orders of magnitude, respectively. The predicted phase change dynamics and sharp pointy-tip formation show excellent agreement with the reference, highlighting the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>
