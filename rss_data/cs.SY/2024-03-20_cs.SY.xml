      <title>Safety-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Electric Vehicle Charging Station Management in Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the grid can pose a significant risk to the distribution system operation in the absence of coordination. In response to the need for effective coordination of EVs within the distribution network, this paper presents a safety-aware reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to manage EV charging stations while ensuring the satisfaction of system constraints. Unlike existing methods, our proposed algorithm does not rely on explicit penalties for constraint violations, eliminating the need for penalty coefficient tuning. Furthermore, managing EV charging stations is further complicated by multiple uncertainties, notably the variability in solar energy generation and energy prices. To address this challenge, we develop an off-policy RL algorithm to efficiently utilize data to learn patterns in such uncertain environments. Our algorithm also incorporates a maximum entropy framework to enhance the RL algorithm's exploratory process, preventing convergence to local optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional RL algorithms in managing EV charging in the distribution network.</description>

      <title>Federated reinforcement learning for robot motion planning with zero-shot generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of learning a control policy for robot motion planning with zero-shot generalization, i.e., no data collection and policy adaptation is needed when the learned policy is deployed in new environments. We develop a federated reinforcement learning framework that enables collaborative learning of multiple learners and a central server, i.e., the Cloud, without sharing their raw data. In each iteration, each learner uploads its local control policy and the corresponding estimated normalized arrival time to the Cloud, which then computes the global optimum among the learners and broadcasts the optimal policy to the learners. Each learner then selects between its local control policy and that from the Cloud for next iteration. The proposed framework leverages on the derived zero-shot generalization guarantees on arrival time and safety. Theoretical guarantees on almost-sure convergence, almost consensus, Pareto improvement and optimality gap are also provided. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Network-Aware Value Stacking of Community Battery via Asynchronous Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community battery systems have been widely deployed to provide services to the grid. Unlike a single battery storage system in the community, coordinating multiple community batteries can further unlock their value, enhancing the viability of community battery solutions. However, the centralized control of community batteries relies on the full information of the system, which is less practical and may even lead to privacy leakage. In this paper, we formulate a value-stacking optimization problem for community batteries to interact with local solar, buildings, and the grid, within distribution network constraints. We then propose a distributed algorithm using asynchronous distributed alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem. Our algorithm is robust to communication latency between community batteries and the grid while preserving the operational privacy. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence of our proposed asynchronous distributed ADMM algorithm. We also evaluate the electricity cost and the contribution of each value stream in the value-stacking problem for community batteries using real-world data.</description>

      <title>Observer-Based Environment Robust Control Barrier Functions for Safety-critical Control with Dynamic Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a safety-critical controller for dynamic and uncertain environments, leveraging a robust environment control barrier function (ECBF) to enhance the robustness against the measurement and prediction uncertainties associated with moving obstacles. The approach reduces conservatism, compared with a worst-case uncertainty approach, by incorporating a state observer for obstacles into the ECBF design. The controller, which guarantees safety, is achieved through solving a quadratic programming problem. The proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated via a dynamic obstacle-avoidance problem for an autonomous vehicle, including comparisons with established baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>A Control-Recoverable Added-Noise-based Privacy Scheme for LQ Control in Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As networked control systems continue to evolve, ensuring the privacy of sensitive data becomes an increasingly pressing concern, especially in situations where the controller is physically separated from the plant. In this paper, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system's state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. Additionally, the proposed privacy-preserving scheme is also proven to satisfy differential privacy. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs. Finally, we verify the validity of our proposed scheme through simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Aggregate Flexibility of EV Charging Stations for Dependable Congestion Management Products: A Dutch Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion. This study analyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands to explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by EV growth and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it analyses the collective ability to provide congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probability of offering specific grid services by different categories of charging stations (CS) is analysed. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. The ability to offer different flexibility products, namely re-dispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed using various dispatch strategies. Next, machine learning models are used to predict the probability of CSs being able to deliver these products, accounting for uncertainties. Results indicate that residential charging locations have significant potential to provide both products during evening peak hours. While shared EVs offer better certainty regarding arrival and departure times, their small fleet size currently restricts their ability to meet the minimum order size of flexible products.</description>

      <title>An Extended Kuramoto Model for Frequency and Phase Synchronization in Delay-Free Networks with Finite Number of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its description of a synchronization between oscillators, the Kuramoto model is an ideal choice for a synchronisation algorithm in networked systems. This requires to achieve not only a frequency synchronization but also a phase synchronization - something the standard Kuramoto model can not provide for a finite number of agents. In this case, a remaining phase difference is necessary to offset differences of the natural frequencies. Setting the Kuramoto model into the context of dynamic consensus and making use of the $n$th order discrete average consensus algorithm, this paper extends the standard Kuramoto model in such a way that frequency and phase synchronization are separated. This in turn leads to an algorithm achieve the required frequency and phase synchronization also for a finite number of agents. Simulations show the viability of this extended Kuramoto model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presented in this article deals with the issue of distributed cooperative formation of multi-agent systems (MASs). It proposes the use of appropriate neural network control methods to address formation requirements (uncertainties dynamic model). It considers an adaptive leader-follower distributed cooperative formation control based on neural networks (NNs) developed for a class of second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems and neural networks Neural networks are used to compute system data that inputs layer (position, velocity), hidden layers, and output layer. Through collaboration between leader-follower approaches and neural networks with complex systems or complex conditions receive an effective cooperative formation control method. The sufficient conditions for the system stability were derived using Lyapunov stability theory, graph theory, and state space methods. By simulation, the results of this study can be obtained from the main data of the multi-agent system in formation control and verified that the system can process consistency, stability, reliability, and accuracy in cooperative formation.</description>

      <title>Augmented Labeled Random Finite Sets and Its Application to Group Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of group target tracking (GTT), wherein multiple closely spaced targets within a group pose a coordinated motion. To improve the tracking performance, the labeled random finite sets (LRFSs) theory is adopted, and this paper develops a new kind of LRFSs, i.e., augmented LRFSs, which introduces group information into the definition of LRFSs. Specifically, for each element in an LRFS, the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of its represented target are incorporated. Furthermore, by means of the labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs, the group structure is iteratively propagated and updated during the tracking process, which achieves the simultaneously estimation of the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of multiple group targets, and further improves the GTT tracking performance. Finally, simulation experiments are provided, which well demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeled multi-Bernoulli filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs for GTT tracking.</description>

      <title>Lattice piecewise affine approximation of explicit model predictive control with application to satellite attitude control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite attitude cotrol is a crucial part of aerospace technology, and model predictive control(MPC) is one of the most promising controllers in this area, which will be less effective if real-time online optimization can not be achieved. Explicit MPC converts the online calculation into a table lookup process, however the solution is difficult to obtain if the system dimension is high or the constraints are complex. The lattice piecewise affine(PWA) function was used to represent the control law of explicit MPC, although the online calculation complexity is reduced, the offline calculation is still prohibitive for complex problems. In this paper, we use the sample points in the feasible region with their corresponding affine functions to construct the lattice PWA approximation of the optimal MPC controller designed for satellite attitude control. The asymptotic stability of satellite attitude control system under lattice PWA approximation has been proven, and simulations are executed to verify that the proposed method can achieve almost the same performance as linear online MPC with much lower online computational complexity and use less fuel than LQR method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Physics-informed Neural Networks for System Identification of Inverter-dominated Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the uncertainty in generation and demand increases, accurately estimating the dynamic characteristics of power systems becomes crucial for employing the appropriate control actions to maintain their stability. In our previous work, we have shown that Bayesian Physics-informed Neural Networks (BPINNs) outperform conventional system identification methods in identifying the power system dynamic behavior under measurement noise. This paper takes the next natural step and addresses the more significant challenge, exploring how BPINN perform in estimating power system dynamics under increasing uncertainty from many Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) connected to the grid. These introduce a different type of uncertainty, compared to noisy measurements. The BPINN combines the advantages of Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), such as inverse problem applicability, with Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification. We explore the BPINN performance on a wide range of systems, starting from a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system and 3-bus system to extract important insights, to the 14-bus CIGRE distribution grid, and the large IEEE 118-bus system. We also investigate approaches that can accelerate the BPINN training, such as pretraining and transfer learning. Throughout this paper, we show that in presence of uncertainty, the BPINN achieves orders of magnitude lower errors than the widely popular method for system identification SINDy and significantly lower errors than PINN, while transfer learning helps reduce training time by up to 80 %.</description>

      <title>3D Directed Formation Control with Global Shape Convergence using Bispherical Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel 3D formation control scheme for directed graphs in a leader-follower configuration, achieving (almost) global convergence to the desired shape. Specifically, we introduce three controlled variables representing bispherical coordinates that uniquely describe the formation in 3D. Acyclic triangulated directed graphs (a class of minimally acyclic persistent graphs) are used to model the inter-agent sensing topology, while the agents' dynamics are governed by single-integrator model. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed decentralized formation controller ensures (almost) global asymptotic stability while avoiding potential shape ambiguities in the final formation. Furthermore, the control laws are implementable in arbitrarily oriented local coordinate frames of follower agents using only low-cost onboard vision sensors, making it suitable for practical applications. Finally, we validate our formation control approach by a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Priority-based Energy Allocation in Buildings for Distributed Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many countries are facing energy shortage today and most of the global energy is consumed by HVAC systems in buildings. For the scenarios where the energy system is not sufficiently supplied to HVAC systems, a priority-based allocation scheme based on distributed model predictive control is proposed in this paper, which distributes the energy rationally based on priority order. According to the scenarios, two distributed allocation strategies, i.e., one-to-one priority strategy and multi-to-one priority strategy, are developed in this paper and validated by simulation in a building containing three zones and a building containing 36 rooms, respectively. Both strategies fully exploit the potential of predictive control solutions. The experiment shows that our scheme has good scalability and achieve the performance of centralized strategy while making the calculation tractable.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic pricing schemes for the utilization of pool ride-hailing vehicles in bus lanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing popularity of ride-hailing services, new modes of transportation are having a significant impact on the overall performance of transportation networks. As a result, there is a need to ensure that both the various transportation alternatives and the spatial network resources are used efficiently. In this work, we analyze a network configuration where part of the urban transportation network is devoted to dedicated bus lanes. Apart from buses, we let pool ride-hailing trips use the dedicated bus lanes which, contingent upon the demand for the remaining modes, may result in faster trips for users opting for the pooling alternative. Under an aggregated modelling framework, we characterize the spatial configuration and the multi-modal demand split for which this strategy achieves a system optimum. For these specific scenarios, we compute the equilibrium when ride-hailing users can choose between solo and pool services, and we provide a pricing scheme for mitigating the gap between total user delays of the system optimum and user equilibrium solutions, when needed.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reconstruction of Nonlinear Systems States via DREM with Perturbation Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new adaptive observer is proposed for a certain class of nonlinear systems with bounded unknown input and parametric uncertainty. Unlike most existing solutions, the proposed approach ensures asymptotic convergence of the unknown parameters, state and perturbation estimates to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the equilibrium point. The solution is based on the novel augmentation of a high-gain observer with the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure enhanced with a perturbation annihilation algorithm. The aforementioned properties of the proposed solution are verified via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On Optimal Management of Energy Storage Systems in Renewable Energy Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable energy communities are legal entities involving the association of citizens, organizations and local businesses aimed at contributing to the green energy transition and providing social, environmental and economic benefits to their members. This goal is pursued through the cooperative efforts of the community actors and by increasing the local energy self-consumption. In this paper, the optimal energy community operation in the presence of energy storage units is addressed. By exploiting the flexibility provided by the storage facilities, the main task is to minimize the community energy bill by taking advantage of incentives related to local self-consumption. Optimality conditions are derived, and an explicit optimal solution is devised. Numerical simulations are provided to assess the performance of the proposed solution.</description>

Abstract: Industrial production processes, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, are complex systems that require continuous monitoring to ensure efficiency, product quality, and safety. This paper presents a hybrid unsupervised learning strategy (HULS) for monitoring complex industrial processes. Addressing the limitations of traditional Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), especially in scenarios with unbalanced data sets and highly correlated process variables, HULS combines existing unsupervised learning techniques to address these challenges. To evaluate the performance of the HULS concept, comparative experiments are performed based on a laboratory batch</description>

      <title>Current-Based Impedance Control for Interacting with Mobile Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robots shift from industrial to human-centered spaces, adopting mobile manipulators, which expand workspace capabilities, becomes crucial. In these settings, seamless interaction with humans necessitates compliant control. Two common methods for safe interaction, admittance, and impedance control, require force or torque sensors, often absent in lower-cost or lightweight robots. This paper presents an adaption of impedance control that can be used on current-controlled robots without the use of force or torque sensors and its application for compliant control of a mobile manipulator. A calibration method is designed that enables estimation of the actuators' current/torque ratios and frictions, used by the adapted impedance controller, and that can handle model errors. The calibration method and the performance of the designed controller are experimentally validated using the Kinova GEN3 Lite arm. Results show that the calibration method is consistent and that the designed controller for the arm is compliant while also being able to track targets with five-millimeter precision when no interaction is present. Additionally, this paper presents two operational modes for interacting with the mobile manipulator: one for guiding the robot around the workspace through interacting with the arm and another for executing a tracking task, both maintaining compliance to external forces. These operational modes were tested in real-world experiments, affirming their practical applicability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Obstacle Avoidance in Robot Manipulators: A Self-Improving Online Training Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution and growing automation of collaborative robots introduce more complexity and unpredictability to systems, highlighting the crucial need for robot's adaptability and flexibility to address the increasing complexities of their environment. In typical industrial production scenarios, robots are often required to be re-programmed when facing a more demanding task or even a few changes in workspace conditions. To increase productivity, efficiency and reduce human effort in the design process, this paper explores the potential of using digital twin combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable robots to generate self-improving collision-free trajectories in real time. The digital twin, acting as a virtual counterpart of the physical system, serves as a 'forward run' for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing the physical system in a safe and cost-effective manner. The physical system sends data to synchronize the digital system through the video feeds from cameras, which allows the virtual robot to update its observation and policy based on real scenarios. The bidirectional communication between digital and physical systems provides a promising platform for hardware-in-the-loop RL training through trial and error until the robot successfully adapts to its new environment. The proposed online training framework is demonstrated on the Unfactory Xarm5 collaborative robot, where the robot end-effector aims to reach the target position while avoiding obstacles. The experiment suggest that proposed framework is capable of performing policy online training, and that there remains significant room for improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an equilibrium-seeking algorithm for finding generalized Nash equilibria of non-cooperative monotone convex quadratic games. Specifically, we recast the Nash equilibrium-seeking problem as variational inequality problem that we solve using a log-domain interior point method and provide a general purpose solver based on this algorithm. This approach is suitable for non-potential, general sum games and does not require extensive structural assumptions. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our method using three benchmark games and demonstrate our algorithm is especially effective on small to medium scale problems.</description>

Abstract: Integrating machine learning into Automated Control Systems (ACS) enhances decision-making in industrial process management. One of the limitations to the widespread adoption of these technologies in industry is the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. This study explores the threats in deploying deep learning models for fault diagnosis in ACS using the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. By evaluating three neural networks with different architectures, we subject them to six types of adversarial attacks and explore five different defense methods. Our results highlight the strong vulnerability of models to adversarial samples and the varying effectiveness of defense strategies. We also propose a novel protection approach by combining multiple defense methods and demonstrate it's efficacy. This research contributes several insights into securing machine learning within ACS, ensuring robust fault diagnosis in industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models for Severity Classification in Traffic Incident Management: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the impact of large language models on enhancing machine learning processes for managing traffic incidents. It examines the extent to which features generated by modern language models improve or match the accuracy of predictions when classifying the severity of incidents using accident reports. Multiple comparisons performed between combinations of language models and machine learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Our research uses both conventional and language model-derived features from texts and incident reports, and their combinations to perform severity classification. Incorporating features from language models with those directly obtained from incident reports has shown to improve, or at least match, the performance of machine learning techniques in assigning severity levels to incidents, particularly when employing Random Forests and Extreme Gradient Boosting methods. This comparison was quantified using the F1-score over uniformly sampled data sets to obtain balanced severity classes. The primary contribution of this research is in the demonstration of how Large Language Models can be integrated into machine learning workflows for incident management, thereby simplifying feature extraction from unstructured text and enhancing or matching the precision of severity predictions using conventional machine learning pipeline. The engineering application of this research is illustrated through the effective use of these language processing models to refine the modelling process for incident severity classification. This work provides significant insights into the application of language processing capabilities in combination with traditional data for improving machine learning pipelines in the context of classifying incident severity.</description>

Abstract: An iterative learning algorithm is presented for continuous-time linear-quadratic optimal control problems where the system is externally symmetric with unknown dynamics. Both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon problems are considered. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is globally convergent to the optimal solution and has some advantages over adaptive dynamic programming, including being unbiased under noisy measurements and having a relatively low computational burden.

      <title>Projection-free computation of robust controllable sets with constrained zonotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing robust controllable sets for discrete-time linear systems with additive uncertainty. We propose a tractable and scalable approach to inner- and outer-approximate robust controllable sets using constrained zonotopes, when the additive uncertainty set is a symmetric, convex, and compact set. Our least-squares-based approach uses novel closed-form approximations of the Pontryagin difference between a constrained zonotopic minuend and a symmetric, convex, and compact subtrahend. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not rely on convex optimization solvers, and is projection-free for ellipsoidal and zonotopic uncertainty sets. We also propose a least-squares-based approach to compute a convex, polyhedral outer-approximation to constrained zonotopes, and characterize sufficient conditions under which all these approximations are exact. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach in several case studies, including the design of abort-safe rendezvous trajectories for a spacecraft in near-rectilinear halo orbit under uncertainty. Our approach can inner-approximate a 20-step robust controllable set for a 100-dimensional linear system in under 15 seconds on a standard computer.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with state estimation of stochastic models with linear state dynamics, continuous or discrete in time. The emphasis is laid on a numerical solution to the state prediction by the time-update step of the grid-point-based point-mass filter (PMF), which is the most computationally demanding part of the PMF algorithm. A novel efficient PMF (ePMF) estimator, unifying continuous and discrete, approaches is proposed, designed, and discussed. By numerical illustrations, it is shown, that the proposed ePMF can lead to a time complexity reduction that exceeds 99.9% without compromising accuracy. The MATLAB code of the ePMF is released with this paper.</description>

      <title>On Continuous Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control with Unknown Apriori Bound on Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims at providing a solution to the problem of designing a continuous and finite-time control for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of matched uncertainty with an unknown apriori bound. First, we propose a Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Manifold (FOITSM) with a conventional (discontinuous) sliding mode to show that it provides the combined attributes of the nonsingular terminal and integral sliding mode algorithms. Secondly, an Adaptive Disturbance Observer (ADO) has been designed to alleviate the effect of the uncertainty acting on the system. On application of the ADO-based Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control (FOITSMC), the chattering phenomenon in control input has been reduced substantially in the presence of conditionally known matched disturbances. Moreover, the adaptive gains of ADO are updated non-monotonically without over-bounding the acting disturbance, yet sustain the global boundedness of state trajectories within a specific bound. %Finally, an application of the proposed algorithm for attitude stabilization of a rigid spacecraft has been successively shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrated development of city clusters has given rise to an increasing demand for intercity travel. Intercity ride-pooling service exhibits considerable potential in upgrading traditional intercity bus services by implementing demand-responsive enhancements. Nevertheless, its online operations suffer the inherent complexities due to the coupling of vehicle resource allocation among cities and pooled-ride vehicle routing. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a two-level framework designed to facilitate online fleet management. Specifically, a novel multi-agent feudal reinforcement learning model is proposed at the upper level of the framework to cooperatively assign idle vehicles to different intercity lines, while the lower level updates the routes of vehicles using an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Numerical studies based on the realistic dataset of Xiamen and its surrounding cities in China show that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the supply and demand imbalances, and achieves significant improvement in both the average daily system profit and order fulfillment ratio.</description>

Abstract: In addressing control problems such as regulation and tracking through reinforcement learning, it is often required to guarantee that the acquired policy meets essential performance and stability criteria such as a desired settling time and steady-state error prior to deployment. Motivated by this necessity, we present a set of results and a systematic reward shaping procedure that (i) ensures the optimal policy generates trajectories that align with specified control requirements and (ii) allows to assess whether any given policy satisfies them. We validate our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments conducted in two representative environments from OpenAI Gym: the Inverted Pendulum swing-up problem and the Lunar Lander. Utilizing both tabular and deep reinforcement learning methods, our experiments consistently affirm the efficacy of our proposed framework, highlighting its effectiveness in ensuring policy adherence to the prescribed control requirements.</description>

      <title>Towards Perturbation-Induced Static Pivoting on GPU-Based Linear Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear system solving is a key tool for computational power system studies, e.g., optimal power flow, transmission switching, or unit commitment. CPU-based linear system solver speeds, however, have saturated in recent years. Emerging research shows that GPU-based linear system solvers are beginning to achieve notable speedup over CPU-based alternatives in some applications. Due to the architecture of GPU memory access, numerical pivoting represents the new bottleneck which prevents GPU-based solvers from running even faster. Accordingly, this paper proposes a matrix perturbation-based method to induce static pivoting. Using this approach, a series of perturbed, well-conditioned, pivot-free linear systems are solved in parallel on GPUs. Matrix expansion routines are then used to linearly combine the results, and the true solution is recovered to an arbitrarily high degree of theoretical accuracy. We showcase the validity of our approach on distributed-slack AC power flow solve iterations associated with the PGLib 300-bus test case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) holds significant importance in smart homes, security, and healthcare. Existing systems face limitations because of the insufficient spatial diversity provided by a limited number of antennas. Furthermore, inefficiencies in noise reduction and feature extraction from sensing data pose challenges to recognition performance. This study presents a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted passive human activity recognition (RISAR) method, compatible with commercial Wi-Fi devices. RISAR leverages a RIS to enhance the spatial diversity of Wi-Fi signals, effectively capturing a wider range of information distributed across the spatial domain. A novel high-dimensional factor model based on random matrix theory is proposed to address noise reduction and feature extraction in the temporal domain. A dual-stream spatial-temporal attention network model is developed to assign variable weights to different characteristics and sequences, mimicking human cognitive processes in prioritizing essential information. Experimental analysis shows that RISAR significantly outperforms existing HAR methods in accuracy and efficiency, achieving an average accuracy of 97.26%. These findings underscore RISAR's adaptability and potential as a robust activity recognition solution in real environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithms for Verification of Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of our techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, instead focussing on particularly relevant areas of the system, guided by heuristics. Our work builds on the previous results of Br{\'{a}}zdil et al., significantly extending it as well as refining several details and fixing errors.
  The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sequencing and Motion Control in a Roundabout with Safety Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a controller for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) traversing a single-lane roundabout. The controller simultaneously determines the optimal sequence and associated optimal motion control jointly minimizing travel time and energy consumption while providing speed-dependent safety guarantees, as well as satisfying velocity and acceleration constraints. This is achieved by integrating (a) Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enable receding horizon optimization with (b) Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (CLBFs) to guarantee convergence to a safe set in finite time, thus providing an extended stability region compared to the use of classic Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). The proposed MPC-CLBF framework addresses both infeasibility and myopic control issues commonly encountered when controlling CAVs over multiple interconnected control zones in a traffic network, which has been a limitation of prior work on CAVs going through roundabouts, while still providing safety guarantees. Simulations under varying traffic demands demonstrate the controller's effectiveness and stability.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Parameter Estimation via DREM with Annihilators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the adaptive control theory, the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure has become widespread as it allows one to describe a variety of adaptive control problems in unified terms of the parameter estimation problem of a regression equation with a scalar regressor. However, when the system/parameterization is affected by perturbations, the estimation laws, which are designed on the basis of such equation, asymptotically provides only biased estimates. In this paper, based on the bias-eliminated least-squares (BELS) approach, a modification of the DREM procedure is proposed that allows one to annihilate perturbations asymptotically and, consequently, asymptotically obtain unbiased estimates. The theoretical results are supported with mathematical modelling and can be used to design adaptive observers and control systems.</description>

      <title>Secure Synchronization of Heterogeneous Pulse-Coupled Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the synchronization of heterogeneous pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs), where some of the oscillators might be faulty or malicious. The oscillators interact through identical pulses at discrete instants and evolve continuously with different frequencies otherwise. Despite the presence of misbehaviors, benign oscillators aim to reach synchronization. To achieve this objective, two resilient synchronization protocols are developed in this paper by adapting the real-valued mean-subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm to pulse-based interactions. The first protocol relies on packet-based communication to transmit absolute frequencies, while the second protocol operates purely with pulses to calculate relative frequencies. In both protocols, each normal oscillator periodically counts the received pulses to detect possible malicious behaviors. By disregarding suspicious pulses from its neighbors, the oscillator updates both its phases and frequencies. The paper establishes sufficient conditions on the initial states and graph structure under which resilient synchronization is achieved in the PCO network. Specifically, the normal oscillators can either detect the presence of malicious nodes or synchronize in both phases and frequencies. Additionally, a comparison between the two algorithms reveals a trade-off between relaxed initial conditions and reduced communication burden.</description>

      <title>Contingency Analyses with Warm Starter using Probabilistic Graphical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyberthreats are an increasingly common risk to the power grid and can thwart secure grid operations. We propose to extend contingency analysis to include cyberthreat evaluations. However, unlike the traditional N-1 or N-2 contingencies, cyberthreats (e.g., MadIoT) require simulating hard-to-solve N-k (with k &gt;&gt; 2) contingencies in a practical amount of time. Purely physics-based power flow solvers, while being accurate, are slow and may not solve N-k contingencies in a timely manner, whereas the emerging data-driven alternatives are fast but not sufficiently generalizable, interpretable, and scalable. To address these challenges, we propose a novel conditional Gaussian Random Field-based data-driven method that performs fast and accurate evaluation of cyberthreats. It achieves speedup of contingency analysis by warm-starting simulations, i.e., improving starting points, for the physical solvers. To improve the physical interpretability and generalizability, the proposed method incorporates domain knowledge by considering the graphical nature of the grid topology. To improve scalability, the method applies physics-informed regularization that reduces model complexity. Experiments validate that simulating MadIoT-induced attacks with our warm starter becomes approximately 5x faster on a realistic 2000-bus system.</description>
