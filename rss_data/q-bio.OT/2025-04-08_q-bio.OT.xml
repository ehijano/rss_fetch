      <title>Addressing ecological challenges from a quantum computing perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increased access to data and the advent of computers, the use of statistical tools and numerical simulations is becoming commonplace for ecologists. These approaches help improve our understanding of ecological phenomena and their underlying mechanisms in increasingly complex environments. However, the development of mathematical and computational tools has made it possible to study high-dimensional problems up to a certain limit. To overcome this issue, quantum computers could be used to study ecological problems on a larger scale by creating new bridges between fields that at first glance appear to be quite different. We introduce the basic concepts needed to understand quantum computers, give an overview of their applications, and discuss their challenges and future opportunities in ecology. Quantum computers will have a significant impact on ecology by improving the power of statistical tools, solve intractable problems in networks, and help understand the dynamics of large systems of interacting species. This innovative computational perspective could redefine our understanding of species interactions, improve predictive modeling of distributions, and optimize conservation strategies, thereby advancing the field of ecology into a new era of discovery and insight.</description>

      <title>Alternatives to the statistical mass confusion of testing for no-effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cell biology, statistical analysis means testing the hypothesis that there was no effect. This weak form of hypothesis testing neglects effect size, is universally misinterpreted, and is disastrously prone to error when combined with high-throughput cell biology. The solution is for analysis of measurements to start and end with an interpretation of effect size.</description>
