      <title>SpiLiFormer: Enhancing Spiking Transformers with Lateral Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on Transformers have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance and high energy efficiency. However, the spiking attention modules of most existing Transformer-based SNNs are adapted from those of analog Transformers, failing to fully address the issue of over-allocating attention to irrelevant contexts. To fix this fundamental yet overlooked issue, we propose a Lateral Inhibition-inspired Spiking Transformer (SpiLiFormer). It emulates the brain's lateral inhibition mechanism, guiding the model to enhance attention to relevant tokens while suppressing attention to irrelevant ones. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10 (+0.45%), CIFAR-100 (+0.48%), CIFAR10-DVS (+2.70%), N-Caltech101 (+1.94%), and ImageNet-1K (+1.6%). Notably, on the ImageNet-1K dataset, SpiLiFormer (69.9M parameters, 4 time steps, 384 resolution) outperforms E-SpikeFormer (173.0M parameters, 8 time steps, 384 resolution), a SOTA spiking Transformer, by 0.46% using only 39% of the parameters and half the time steps. Our code and training checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>A Bird Song Detector for improving bird identification through Deep Learning: a case study from Do\~nana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring with automatic recorders is essential for ecosystem conservation but generates vast unsupervised audio data, posing challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning techniques offer a promising solution. BirdNET, a widely used model for bird identification, has shown success in many study systems but is limited in some regions due to biases in its training data. A key challenge in bird species detection is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations. To overcome these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a region facing significant conservation threats. Our approach included a Bird Song Detector to isolate vocalizations and custom classifiers trained with BirdNET embeddings. We manually annotated 461 minutes of audio from three habitats across nine locations, yielding 3,749 annotations for 34 classes. Spectrograms facilitated the use of image processing techniques. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all classification models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of the Bird Song Detector and fine-tuned BirdNET compared to the baseline without the Bird Song Detector. Our approach demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with fine-tuned classification models for bird identification at local soundscapes. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools for specific ecological challenges, as demonstrated in Do\~nana. Automatically detecting bird species serves for tracking the health status of this threatened ecosystem, given the sensitivity of birds to environmental changes, and helps in the design of conservation measures for reducing biodiversity loss</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Cameras in Astronomy: Unveiling the Future of Celestial Imaging Beyond Conventional Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To deepen our understanding of optical astronomy, we must advance imaging technology to overcome conventional frame-based cameras' limited dynamic range and temporal resolution. Our Perspective paper examines how neuromorphic cameras can effectively address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from the human retina, neuromorphic cameras excel in speed and high dynamic range by utilizing asynchronous pixel operation and logarithmic photocurrent conversion, making them highly effective for celestial imaging. We use 1300 mm terrestrial telescope to demonstrate the neuromorphic camera's ability to simultaneously capture faint and bright celestial sources while preventing saturation effects. We illustrate its photometric capabilities through aperture photometry of a star field with faint stars. Detection of the faint gas cloud structure of the Trapezium cluster during a full moon night highlights the camera's high dynamic range, effectively mitigating static glare from lunar illumination. Our investigations also include detecting meteorite passing near the Moon and Earth, as well as imaging satellites and anthropogenic debris with exceptionally high temporal resolution using a 200mm telescope. Our observations show the immense potential of neuromorphic cameras in advancing astronomical optical imaging and pushing the boundaries of observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>GazeSCRNN: Event-based Near-eye Gaze Tracking using a Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces GazeSCRNN, a novel spiking convolutional recurrent neural network designed for event-based near-eye gaze tracking. Leveraging the high temporal resolution, energy efficiency, and compatibility of Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) cameras with event-based systems, GazeSCRNN uses a spiking neural network (SNN) to address the limitations of traditional gaze-tracking systems in capturing dynamic movements. The proposed model processes event streams from DVS cameras using Adaptive Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (ALIF) neurons and a hybrid architecture optimized for spatio-temporal data. Extensive evaluations on the EV-Eye dataset demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting gaze vectors. In addition, we conducted ablation studies to reveal the importance of the ALIF neurons, dynamic event framing, and training techniques, such as Forward-Propagation-Through-Time, in enhancing overall system performance. The most accurate model achieved a Mean Angle Error (MAE) of 6.034{\deg} and a Mean Pupil Error (MPE) of 2.094 mm. Consequently, this work is pioneering in demonstrating the feasibility of using SNNs for event-based gaze tracking, while shedding light on critical challenges and opportunities for further improvement.</description>

      <title>The Morphology-Control Trade-Off: Insights into Soft Robotic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robotics holds transformative potential for enabling adaptive and adaptable systems in dynamic environments. However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.</description>

      <title>LLM-SR: Scientific Equation Discovery via Programming with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings. We also show that LLM-SR's incorporation of scientific priors enables more efficient equation space exploration than the baselines.

      <title>Neural Networks Trained by Weight Permutation are Universal Approximators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal approximation property is fundamental to the success of neural networks, and has traditionally been achieved by training networks without any constraints on their parameters. However, recent experimental research proposed a novel permutation-based training method, which exhibited a desired classification performance without modifying the exact weight values. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of this permutation training method by proving its ability to guide a ReLU network to approximate one-dimensional continuous functions. Our numerical results further validate this method's efficiency in regression tasks with various initializations. The notable observations during weight permutation suggest that permutation training can provide an innovative tool for describing network learning behavior.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Orthogonal Convolution Scheme for Efficient and Flexible CNN Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are the workhorse of multiple areas in machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitzconstrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions.In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method for constructing orthogonal convolutions, effectively overcoming these limitations. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source library implementing this method, available at https://github.com/thib-s/orthogonium.</description>
