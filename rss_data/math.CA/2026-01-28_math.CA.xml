      <title>Beyond Single-Window Graph Fourier Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-windowed graph Fourier transform (MWGFT) for the joint vertex-frequency analysis of signals defined on graphs. Building on generalized translation and modulation induced by the graph Laplacian, the proposed framework extends the windowed graph Fourier transform by allowing multiple analysis and synthesis windows. Exact reconstruction formulas are derived for complex-valued graph signals, together with sufficient and computable conditions guaranteeing stable invertibility. The associated families of windowed graph Fourier atoms are shown to form frames for the space of graph signals. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world graphs confirm exact reconstruction up to machine precision and demonstrate improved stability and vertex-frequency localization compared to single-window constructions, particularly on irregular graph topologies.</description>

      <title>On the frequency function of Hardy-Littlewood maximal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the frequency function (introduced by Temur) in both the discrete and continuous settings. More precisely, we extend the definition of the frequency function to the higher-dimensional continuous setting and to the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the frequency function and the density of its small values for functions in $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z)}$ and $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ answering some questions posed by Temur. Finally, we study the size of the frequency function for functions in $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ with $p&gt;1$, showing that this case differs significantly from the case $p=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an improved lower bound for the restricted reverse weak-type estimate of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $M$. This result is applied to the $\lambda$-median maximal operator $m_{\lambda}$ acting on a Banach function space $X$. We show that under certain assumptions on $X$, the boundedness properties of $m_{\lambda}$ and $M$ are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Jacobi-Pi\~neiro Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials on the simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that Rodrigues formulas provide a very powerful tool to compute orthogonal polynomials with respect to classical weights. We provide an example of bivariate multiple polynomials on the simplex defined via a Rodrigues formula. This approach offers a natural generalization of Jacobi--Pi\~neiro polynomials to the multivariate setting. Moreover, we apply these polynomials to the study of the bivariate Hermite--Pad\'e problem on the triangle.</description>

      <title>Characterization of eigenfunctions of Laplacian having exponential growth using Fourier multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1993, Robert Strichartz established a characterization for bounded eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $\left\{f_k \right\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}$ be a doubly infinite sequence of functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying $\Delta f_k= f_{k+1}$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. If $\left\{f_k \right\}$'s are uniformly bounded, then Strichartz proved that $\Delta f_0= f_0$, thus generalizing a classical result of Roe on the real line. Recognizing that many physically significant eigenfunctions exhibit unbounded behavior, Howard and Reese extended this result to include functions of polynomial growth. Building upon a refined functional-analytic framework, we recently established a broader extension of Strichartz's theorem encompassing eigenfunctions of exponential growth. In the present article, we further investigate the spectral geometry of the Laplacian by replacing the differential operator with a broader class of Fourier multipliers. Specifically, we focus on radial convolution operators, including the spherical average, the ball average, and the heat operator. The central problem addressed is as follows: For a fixed multiplier $\Theta$, we consider a doubly infinite sequence of exponentially growing functions $\{f_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$ satisfying the recurrence relation $\Theta f_k = A f_{k+1}$ for a complex constant $A$. We demonstrate that under specific spectral conditions, the functions $f_k$ correspond precisely to the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian $\Delta$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. This result provides a unified approach to characterization theorems, linking the growth rate of eigenfunctions to the symbol of the associated multiplier.</description>

      <title>Nikod\'ym maximal function with restricted directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the planar Nikod\'ym maximal operator $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta;\delta}$ associated to a direction set $\Theta \subset \mathbb{S}^{1}$. We show that the quasi-Assouad dimension $s := \dim_{\mathrm{qA}} \Theta$ characterises the essential $L^{p}$-boundedness of $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta;\delta}$ in the following sense. If $s \in [\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, then $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta;\delta}$ is essentially bounded on $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ for $p \geq 1 + s$, and essentially unbounded for $p &lt; 1 + s$. Here essential boundedness means $L^{p}$-boundedness with constant $O_{\epsilon}(\delta^{-\epsilon})$. We also show that the characterisation described above fails for $s &lt; \tfrac{1}{2}$. More precisely, there exists a set $\Theta \subset \mathbb{S}^{1}$ with $\dim_{\mathrm{qA}} \Theta = \tfrac{1}{3}$ such that $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta;\delta}$ is essentially unbounded on $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ for all $p &lt; \tfrac{3}{2}$.
  As an application, we show there exists a convex domain with affine dimension $\tfrac{1}{6}$ such that the $\alpha$-order Bochner-Riesz means converge in $L^6$ for all $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative FUP and spectral gap for quasi-Fuchsian group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the exponent $\beta$ in the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle (FUP) established by Cohen 2023, quantifying its dependence on the porosity parameter $\nu$ of the Fourier support. This quantitative version of FUP yields an explicit essential spectral gap for convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds arising from quasi-Fuchsian groups, thereby refining the result of Tao 2025. Our result extends the earlier work of Jin-Zhang 2020 to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Approximation by linear sampling operators in Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies approximation properties of linear sampling operators in general Banach lattices $X$. We obtain matching direct and inverse approximation estimates, convergence criteria, equivalence results involving special $K$-functionals and their realizations by sampling operators, as well as strong converse inequalities, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously established for sampling operators even in the classical spaces $L_p$. The results extend several classical theorems previously known mainly in $L_p$ and apply to all functions $f\in X$ for which the corresponding sampling operator is well defined, thereby substantially enlarging the class of functions that can be considered in this framework.</description>

      <title>Sharp embeddings between weighted Paley-Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of estimating the operator norm of the embeddings between multidimensional weighted Paley-Wiener spaces. These can be equivalently thought as Fourier uncertainty principles for bandlimited functions. By means of radial symmetrization mechanisms, we show that such problems can all be shifted to dimension one. We provide precise asymptotics in the general case and, in some particular situations, we are able to identify the sharp constants and characterize the extremizers. The sharp constant study is actually a consequence of a more general result we prove in the setup of de Branges spaces of entire functions, addressing the operator given by multiplication by $z^k$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Applications to sharp higher order Poincar\'{e} inequalities and other related extremal problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and some applications in harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets based on Diophantine approximation in the Euclidean space, and consider their applications in several problems in harmonic analysis.
  Our first application is on the Hausdorff dimension of our sets. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang on the ABC sum-product problem is sharp. Higher dimensional cases and the relation to orthogonal projections are also discussed. Some conjectures are proposed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. For every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$, we are able to construct a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that has Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions, i.e.,
  $$\mu(B(x,r))\lesssim_\epsilon r^{s-\epsilon}
  \ \text{and} \ |\hat{\mu}(\xi)|\lesssim_\epsilon |\xi|^{-t/2 +\epsilon}, \ \forall\,\epsilon&gt;0.$$
  It is fundamental but the very first such result in the literature.
  Our last result is to provide a viewpoint of the sharpness of Fourier restriction over general measures from dimensions of sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Strictly Monotone Numerosity on Tame Sets via the Steiner Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses inspiration from Integral Geometry to connect Tame Geometry with Nonstandard Analysis. We omit binomial coefficients from the Steiner polynomial to define the \textit{intrinsic volume polynomial} $\Phi$, a valuation defined on bounded definable sets in an o-minimal structure. We prove that using this normalization gives a strictly monotone valuation on point sets when the codomain $\mathbb{R}[t]$ is interpreted with ordering by end behavior. This leads to an algebraic version of Hadwiger's Theorem: $\Phi$ is the unique conormal continuous, similarity-equivariant homomorphism of ordered rings from $\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^\infty) \to \mathbb{R}[t]$ (up to scaling). Noting that strict monotonicity is mirrored in numerosity theory (a branch of nonstandard analysis), we prove existence for a numerosity that exceptionally approximates the intrinsic volume polynomial. This suggests a connection between disparate fields, allowing each to complement the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cone of non-negative polynomials on generalized elliptic curves. We show that the zero set of every extreme ray has dense real points. If a generalized elliptic curve is embedded via a complete linear system, then we show that the convex hull of its real points (taken inside any affine chart containing all real points) is a spectrahedron. On the way, we generalize a result by Geyer--Martens on 2-torsion points in the Picard group of smooth real curves (of arbitrary genus) to possibly singular and reducible ones.</description>

      <title>Hill-Type Stability Analysis of Periodic Solutions of Fractional-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear) fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however, a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.</description>

      <title>Residue sums for superconformal indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superconformal indices of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry. The usual representation of a gauge theory index involves multiple contour integrals and reflects the BPS spectrum at zero Yang-Mills coupling. To find an alternative, closed form expression, it is natural to attempt an evaluation of the integrals through residues. However, the presence of non-isolated essential singularities prevents a straightforward evaluation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the Macdonald index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(2)$ super Yang--Mills theory, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. We observe that the simplified form encodes features of the BPS spectrum at non-zero coupling and suggests the absence of fortuitous or non-graviton operators in the Macdonald sector. Furthermore, we evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form.</description>

      <title>Blow-up, decay, and convergence to equilibrium for focusing damped cubic Klein-Gordon and Duffing equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study long-time dynamics of the damped focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation on a compact three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, together with its space-independent reduction, the damped focusing Duffing equation. Under the geometric control condition on the damping and an assumption on the set of stationary solutions, we establish a sharp trichotomy for initial data with energy slightly above that of the ground state: every solution either blows up in finite time, decays exponentially to zero, or converges to a ground state. We provide a complete classification of the Duffing dynamics above the energy of the constant solution, use it to construct Klein-Gordon solutions realising each of the three behaviours in the case of a domain without boundary, and derive a simple spectral criterion ensuring that the ground states are nonconstant - and hence that different types of behaviour can indeed occur for solutions with initial energy above that of the ground state.</description>
