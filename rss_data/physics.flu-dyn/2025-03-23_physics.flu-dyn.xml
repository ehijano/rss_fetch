      <title>High-order mesh-free direct numerical simulation of lean hydrogen flames in confined geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we perform the first analysis of high-fidelity simulations of the propagation of lean hydrogen flames through porous media, taking cylindrical arrays a representative example geometry. In this fundamental study we discuss the impact of confinement on both thermodiffusive and thermoacoustic instabilities. Flame propagation in these complex geometries is cannot be performed by leading mesh-based codes, and is instead simulated using a high-order meshfree method, LABFM. Pore scale propagation is shown to be dependent on throat width between cylinders, and this is then related to large-scale flame dynamics, allowing us to give a heuristic explanation for the increased growth rate of the thermodiffusive instability in more confined geometries. Thermoacoustic instabilities are also observed for sufficiently confined geometries. Understanding these instability mechanisms is crucial for improving the design of future combustors, both in terms of controlling flame dynamics and increasing the durability of combustors.</description>

      <title>Modelling Material Injection Into Porous Structures With the Theory of Porous Media Under Non-isothermal Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Theory of Porous Media (TPM) is employed to model percutaneous vertebroplasty, a medical procedure in which acrylic cement is injected into cancellous vertebral bone. Previously, isothermal macroscale models have been derived to describe this material injection and the mechanical interactions which arise. However, the temperature of the injected cement is typically below the human body temperature, necessitating the extension of these models to the non-isothermal case. Following the modelling principles of the TPM and considering local thermal non-equilibrium conditions, our model introduces three energy balances as well as additional constitutive relations. If restricted to local thermal equilibrium conditions, our model equations are in agreement with other examples of TPM-based models. We observe that our model elicits physically reasonable behaviour in numerical simulations which employ parameter values and initial and boundary conditions relevant for our application. Noting that we neglect capillary effects, we claim our model to be thermodynamically consistent despite the employment of simplifying assumptions during its derivation, such as the Coleman and Noll procedure.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Ideal Single Vortex Flows Using the Differentiable Vortex Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the differentiable vortex particle method (DVPM) beyond idealized flow scenarios to encompass more realistic, non-ideal conditions, including viscous flow and flow subjected to non-conservative body forces. We establish the Lamb-Oseen vortex as a benchmark case, representing a fundamental viscous single vortex flow in fluid mechanics. This selection offers significant analytical advantages, as the Lamb-Oseen vortex possesses an exact analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, thereby providing definitive ground truth data for training and validation purposes. Through rigorous evaluation across a spectrum of Reynolds numbers, we demonstrate that DVPM achieves superior accuracy in modeling the Lamb-Oseen vortex compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our results substantiate DVPM's robust capabilities in modeling non-ideal single vortex flows, establishing its distinct advantages over contemporary deep learning methodologies in fluid dynamics applications. The dataset and source code are publicly available on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/jh36714753/Learning_Non-Ideal_Single_Vortex_Flows.</description>

      <title>Evaluating near-surface wind speeds simulated by the CRCM6-GEM5 model using AmeriFlux data over North America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of various configurations of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM6-GEM5) in simulating 10-meter wind speeds using data from 27 AmeriFlux stations across North America. The assessment employs a hierarchy of error metrics, ranging from simple mean bias to advanced metrics that account for the dependence of wind speeds on variables such as friction velocity and stability. The results reveal that (i) the value of roughness length (z0) has a large effect on the simulation of wind speeds, (ii) using a lower limit for the Obhukov length instead of a lower limit for the lowest level wind speed seems to deteriorate the simulation of wind speeds under very stable conditions, (iii) the choice of stability function has a small but noticeable impact on the wind speeds, (iv) the turbulent orographic form drag scheme shows improvement over effective roughness length approach.</description>
