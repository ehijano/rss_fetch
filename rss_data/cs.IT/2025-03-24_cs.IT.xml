      <title>Transformer-based Wireless Symbol Detection Over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Transformers, through in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to adapt to new tasks using example prompts without model update. Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high detection accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose the DEcision Feedback INcontExt Detection (DEFINED) solution as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts as pseudo-labels to improve the detection for subsequent symbols. Furthermore, we proposed another detection method where we combine ICL with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) to extract information from both labeled and unlabeled data during inference, thus avoiding the errors propagated during the decision feedback process of the original DEFINED. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless communication settings demonstrate that a small Transformer trained with DEFINED or IC-SSL achieves significant performance improvements over conventional methods, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair to achieve similar performance of the latter with more than 4 pilot pairs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Code Structure to Improve Soft Output for GRAND, GCD, OSD, and SCL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to a proposed codeword, error correction decoders that provide blockwise soft output (SO) return an estimate of the likelihood that the decoding is correct. Following Forney, such estimates are traditionally only possible for list decoders where the soft output is the likelihood that a decoding is correct given it is assumed to be in the list. Recently, it has been established that Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND), Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD), Ordered Statistics Decoding (OSD), and Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding can provide more accurate soft output, even without list decoding. Central to the improvement is a per-decoding estimate of the likelihood that a decoding has not been found that can be readily calculated during the decoding process. Here we explore how linear codebook constraints can be employed to further enhance the precision of such SO. We evaluate performance by adapting a forecasting statistic called the Brier Score. Results indicate that the SO generated by the approach is essentially as accurate as the maximum a posteriori estimate.</description>

      <title>UAV-Relay Assisted RSMA Fluid Antenna System: Outage Probability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies the impact of fluid antenna system (FAS) technology on the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted multiuser communication networks. Specifically, we consider a scenario where a fixed-position antenna (FPA) base station (BS) serves K FAS-equipped users with the assistance of a UAV acting as an aerial relay. The BS employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), while the UAV operates in half-duplex (HD) mode using the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. For this system, we derive a compact analytical expression for the outage probability (OP) and its asymptotic behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, leveraging the multivariate t-distribution. Our results show how deploying FAS at ground users (GUs) in UAV-aided communications improves overall system performance compared to using FPA GUs.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Blahut-Arimoto Algorithm for Capacity Region Calculation of Gaussian Vector Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the computation of the capacity region of a continuous, Gaussian vector broadcast channel (BC) with covariance matrix constraints. Since the decision variables of the corresponding optimization problem are Gaussian distributed, they can be characterized by a finite number of parameters. Consequently, we develop new Blahut-Arimoto (BA)-type algorithms that can compute the capacity without discretizing the channel. First, by exploiting projection and an approximation of the Lagrange multiplier, which are introduced to handle certain positive semidefinite constraints in the optimization formulation, we develop the Gaussian BA algorithm with projection (GBA-P). Then, we demonstrate that one of the subproblems arising from the alternating updates admits a closed-form solution. Based on this result, we propose the Gaussian BA algorithm with alternating updates (GBA-A) and establish its convergence guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the GBA-P algorithm to compute the capacity region of the Gaussian vector BC with both private and common messages. All the proposed algorithms are parameter-free. Lastly, we present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Random Access in MIMO Quasi-Static Rayleigh Fading Channels: Finite Blocklength and Scaling Law Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the unsourced random access (URA) problem with a random and unknown number of active users in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. We derive non-asymptotic achievability bounds on the probability of incorrectly estimating the number of active users, and provide scaling laws on the gap between the estimated and true numbers of active users. We prove that the error probability reaches a plateau as the power $P$ and blocklength $n$ increase, whereas it decays exponentially with the number $L$ of receive antennas and eventually vanishes. Then, we explore the fundamental limits of URA by deriving non-asymptotic achievability bounds and converse bounds (including two single-user converse bounds and one multi-user ensemble converse bound) on the minimum energy-per-bit required by each active user to transmit $J$ bits with blocklength $n$ under misdetection and false-alarm constraints. Numerical results show that the extra required energy-per-bit due to the uncertainty in the number ${\rm{K}}_a$ of active users decreases as $L$ and $\mathbb{E}[{\rm{K}}_a]$ increase and the error requirement becomes milder. In the non-asymptotic regime, using codewords distributed on a sphere outperforms Gaussian random coding. Existing schemes are shown to exhibit a large gap to our bounds when the number of active users is large, calling for more advanced schemes that perform energy-efficiently in this case. In the asymptotic regime with $n\to\infty$, we establish scaling laws on the minimum required $P$ and $L$ to reliably support ${\rm{K}}_a$ active users as functions of $n$, which highlight the potential of MIMO in enabling low-cost communication and indicate that it is possible for the minimum required $P$ and $L$ to remain on the same order when the number of active users increases but stays below a threshold.</description>

      <title>SuperARC: A Test for General and Super Intelligence Based on First Principles of Recursion Theory and Algorithmic Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an open-ended test grounded in algorithmic probability that can avoid benchmark contamination in the quantitative evaluation of frontier models in the context of their Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence (ASI) claims. Unlike other tests, this test does not rely on statistical compression methods (such as GZIP or LZW), which are more closely related to Shannon entropy than to Kolmogorov complexity. The test challenges aspects related to features of intelligence of fundamental nature such as synthesis and model creation in the context of inverse problems (generating new knowledge from observation). We argue that metrics based on model abstraction and optimal Bayesian inference for planning can provide a robust framework for testing intelligence, including natural intelligence (human and animal), narrow AI, AGI, and ASI. Our results show no clear evidence of LLM convergence towards a defined level of intelligence, particularly AGI or ASI. We found that LLM model versions tend to be fragile and incremental, as new versions may perform worse than older ones, with progress largely driven by the size of training data. The results were compared with a hybrid neurosymbolic approach that theoretically guarantees model convergence from optimal inference based on the principles of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity. The method outperforms LLMs in a proof-of-concept on short binary sequences. Our findings confirm suspicions regarding the fundamental limitations of LLMs, exposing them as systems optimised for the perception of mastery over human language. Progress among different LLM versions from the same developers was found to be inconsistent and limited, particularly in the absence of a solid symbolic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Infinite-fold Quantum Advantage in Classical Correlation Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hypothesis testing problem of detecting the presence of a thermal source emitting coherent quantum states towards an arbitrary but fixed number $K$ of detectors versus the situation where the detectors are presented uncorrelated thermal noise of the same average energy in the setting of asymmetric hypothesis testing. We compare two variations of this theme: In the first one the detectors perform heterodyne or homodyne detection and then transmit their measured results to a central processing unit with unlimited computational resources. In the second one the detectors are able to teleport the quantum states to the central unit, which acts on the received quantum states with unlimited quantum computational resources. We find that when the average received energy per detector goes to zero, the ratio of the error exponents goes to infinity, indicating an infinite-fold quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>A multiscale cavity method for sublinear-rank symmetric matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a statistical model for symmetric matrix factorization with additive Gaussian noise in the high-dimensional regime where the rank $M$ of the signal matrix to infer scales with its size $N$ as $M={\rm o}(\sqrt{\ln N})$. Allowing for an $N$-dependent rank offers new challenges and requires new methods. Working in the Bayes-optimal setting, we show that whenever the signal has i.i.d.~entries, the limiting mutual information between signal and data is given by a variational formula involving a rank-one replica symmetric potential. In other words, from the information-theoretic perspective, the case of a (slowly) growing rank is the same as when $M=1$ (namely, the standard spiked Wigner model). The proof is primarily based on a novel multiscale cavity method allowing for growing rank along with some information-theoretic identities on worst noise for the vector Gaussian channel. We believe that the cavity method developed here will play a role in the analysis of a broader class of inference and spin models where the degrees of freedom are large arrays instead of vectors.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rate Regions for Multi-terminal Quantum Channels via Coset Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over (i) a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and (ii) a $3-$user quantum broadcast channel (QBC). Our focus is on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of both the $3-$user QIC and $3-$user QBC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.</description>

      <title>Noise Variance Estimation Using Asymptotic Residual in Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.13678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In compressed sensing, measurements are typically contaminated by additive noise, and therefore, information about the noise variance is often needed to design algorithms. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the unknown noise variance in compressed sensing problems. The proposed method, called asymptotic residual matching (ARM), estimates the noise variance from a single measurement vector on the basis of the asymptotic result for the $\ell_{1}$ optimization problem. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic residual corresponding to the $\ell_{1}$ optimization and show that it depends on the noise variance. The proposed ARM approach obtains the estimate by comparing the asymptotic residual with the actual one, which can be obtained by empirical reconstruction without the information on the noise variance. For the proposed ARM, we also propose a method to choose a reasonable parameter based on the asymptotic residual. Simulation results show that the proposed noise variance estimation outperforms several conventional methods, especially when the problem size is small. We also show that, by using the proposed method, we can tune the regularization parameter of the $\ell_{1}$ optimization to achieve good reconstruction performance, even when the noise variance is unknown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider extended $1$-perfect codes in Hamming graphs $H(n,q)$. Such nontrivial codes are known only when $n=2^k$, $k\geq 1$, $q=2$, or $n=q+2$, $q=2^m$, $m\geq 1$. Recently, Bespalov proved nonexistence of extended $1$-perfect codes for $q=3$, $4$, $n&gt;q+2$. In this work, we characterize all positive integers $n$, $r$ and prime $p$, for which there exist such a code in $H(n,p^r)$. We also consider $2$-perfect codes in Hamming $H(n,q)$ and Johnson graphs $J(n,w)$ and find new necessary conditions on there existence.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic causal structure emerging through compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression. We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.</description>
