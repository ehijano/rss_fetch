      <title>Simulation of Random LR Fuzzy Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random fuzzy variables join the modeling of the impreciseness (due to their ``fuzzy part'') and randomness. Statistical samples of such objects are widely used, and their direct, numerically effective generation is therefore necessary. Usually, these samples consist of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In this paper, we describe theoretical results and simulation algorithms for another family of fuzzy numbers -- LR fuzzy numbers with interval-valued cores. Starting from a simulation perspective on the piecewise linear LR fuzzy numbers with the interval-valued cores, their limiting behavior is then considered. This leads us to the numerically efficient algorithm for simulating a sample consisting of such fuzzy values.</description>

      <title>Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.</description>

      <title>Utilising Deep Learning to Elicit Expert Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work [ 14 ] has introduced a method for prior elicitation that utilizes records of expert decisions to infer a prior distribution. While this method provides a promising approach to eliciting expert uncertainty, it has only been demonstrated using tabular data, which may not entirely represent the information used by experts to make decisions. In this paper, we demonstrate how analysts can adopt a deep learning approach to utilize the method proposed in [14 ] with the actual information experts use. We provide an overview of deep learning models that can effectively model expert decision-making to elicit distributions that capture expert uncertainty and present an example examining the risk of colon cancer to show in detail how these models can be used.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the impact of outcome delay on the efficiency of two-arm group-sequential trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive designs(AD) are a broad class of trial designs that allow preplanned modifications based on patient data providing improved efficiency and flexibility. However, a delay in observing the primary outcome variable can harm this added efficiency. In this paper, we aim to ascertain the size of such outcome delay that results in the realised efficiency gains of ADs becoming negligible compared to classical fixed sample RCTs. We measure the impact of delay by developing formulae for the no. of overruns in 2 arm GSDs with normal data, assuming different recruitment models. The efficiency of a GSD is usually measured in terms of the expected sample size (ESS), with GSDs generally reducing the ESS compared to a standard RCT. Our formulae measures the efficiency gain from a GSD in terms of ESS reduction that is lost due to delay. We assess whether careful choice of design (e.g., altering the spacing of the IAs) can help recover the benefits of GSDs in presence of delay. We also analyse the efficiency of GSDs with respect to time to complete the trial. Comparing the expected efficiency gains, with and without consideration of delay, it is evident GSDs suffer considerable losses due to delay. Even a small delay can have a significant impact on the trial's efficiency. In contrast, even in the presence of substantial delay, a GSD will have a smaller expected time to trial completion in comparison to a simple RCT. Greater efficiency is lost with increase in the no. of stages. The timing of IAs also can impact the efficiency of a GSDs with delay. Particularly, for unequally spaced IAs, conducting IAs too early in the trial can be harmful for the design with delay.</description>
