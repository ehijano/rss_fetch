      <title>Integrating Base Station with Intelligent Surface for 6G Wireless Networks: Architectures, Design Issues, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent surface (IS) is envisioned as a promising technology for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, which can effectively reconfigure the wireless propagation environment via dynamically controllable signal reflection/transmission. In particular, integrating passive intelligent surface (IS) into the base station (BS) is a novel solution to enhance the wireless network throughput and coverage both cost-effectively and energyefficiently. In this article, we provide an overview of IS-integrated BSs for wireless networks, including their motivations, practical architectures, and main design issues. Moreover, numerical results are presented to compare the performance of different IS-integrated BS architectures as well as the conventional BS without IS. Finally, promising directions are pointed out to stimulate future research on IS-BS/terminal integration in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>dAJC: A 2.02mW 50Mbps Direct Analog to MJPEG Converter for Video Sensor Node using Low-Noise Switched Capacitor MAC-Quantizer with Auto-Calibration and Sparsity-Aware ADC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement in the field of the Internet of Things(IoT) and Internet of Bodies(IoB), video camera applications using Video Sensor Nodes(VSNs) have gained importance in the field of autonomous driving, health monitoring, robot control, and security camera applications. However, these applications typically involve high data rates due to the transmission of high-resolution video signals, resulting from high data volume generated from the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This significant data deluge poses processing and storage overheads, exacerbating the problem. To address this challenge, we propose a low-power solution aimed at reducing the power consumption in Video Sensor Nodes (VSNs) by shifting the computation from the digital domain to the inherently energy-efficient analog domain. Unlike standard architectures where computation and processing are typically performed in digital signal processing (DSP) blocks after the ADCs, our approach eliminates the need for such blocks. Instead, we leverage a switched capacitor-based computation unit in the analog domain, resulting in a reduction in power consumption. We achieve a $\sim4X$ reduction in power consumption compared to digital implementations. Furthermore, we employ a sparsity-aware ADC, which is enabled only for significant compressed samples that contribute to a small fraction ($\le5\%$) of the total captured analog samples, we achieve a $\sim20X$ lower ADC conversion energy without any considerable degradation, contributing to the overall energy savings in the system.</description>

      <title>Design Guidelines and Applications for Dual-Band Rat-Race Couplers and Gysel Power Dividers with Unequal Amplitude Imbalances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the design guidelines for a dual-band rat-race coupler and Gysel power divider with two different amplitude imbalances. The dual-band conditions are established based on the electrical nature of the coupler and dual-band C-section coupled lines/ T-structure/ $\Pi$-structures instead of using the dual-band equivalent transmission lines. It has been shown here that the same design equations can be utilized in the design of the rat-race coupler and Gysel power divider. The design equations are solved numerically to obtain the electrical parameters of the proposed coupler and power divider. The possible application of dual-band different power division ratios is presented for dual-band polarization controlled by a patch antenna. A design tool has been developed to obtain the coupler and power divider's design parameters and circuit analysis results. A design example of the coupler has been provided to validate the proposed concept.</description>

      <title>ECG Signal Denoising Using Multi-scale Patch Embedding and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is a major life-threatening condition that is commonly monitored using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, these signals are often contaminated by various types of noise at different intensities, significantly interfering with downstream tasks. Therefore, denoising ECG signals and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio is crucial for cardiovascular monitoring. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method that combines a one-dimensional convolutional layer with transformer architecture for denoising ECG signals. The convolutional layer processes the ECG signal by various kernel/patch sizes and generates an embedding called multi-scale patch embedding. The embedding then is used as the input of a transformer network and enhances the capability of the transformer for denoising the ECG signal.</description>

      <title>One-Bit MIMO Detection: From Global Maximum-Likelihood Detector to Amplitude Retrieval Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As communication systems advance towards the future 6G era, the incorporation of large-scale antenna arrays in base stations (BSs) presents challenges such as increased hardware costs and energy consumption. To address these issues, the use of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) has gained significant attentions. This paper focuses on one-bit multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection in an uplink multiuser transmission scenario where the BS employs one-bit ADCs. One-bit quantization retains only the sign information and loses the amplitude information, which poses a unique challenge in the corresponding detection problem. The maximum-likelihood (ML) formulation of one-bit MIMO detection has a challenging likelihood function that hinders the application of many high-performance detectors developed for classic MIMO detection (under high-resolution ADCs). While many approximate methods for the ML detection problem have been studied, it lacks an efficient global algorithm. This paper fills this gap by proposing an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm, which is guaranteed to find the global solution of the one-bit ML MIMO detection problem. Additionally, a new amplitude retrieval (AR) detection approach is developed, incorporating explicit amplitude variables into the problem formulation. The AR approach yields simpler objective functions that enable the development of efficient algorithms offering both global and approximate solutions. The paper also contributes to the computational complexity analysis of both ML and AR detection problems. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed formulations and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis for a rotary compressor at high speed: experimental study and mathematical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conducted a comprehensive study on the performance of a rotary compressor over a rotational speed range of 80Hz to 200Hz through experimental tests and mathematical modeling. A compressor performance test rig was designed to conduct the performance tests, with fast-response pressure sensors and displacement sensors capturing the P-V diagram and dynamic motion of the moving components. Results show that the compressor efficiency degrades at high speeds due to the dominant loss factors of leakage and discharge power loss. Supercharging effects become significant at speeds above 160Hz, and its net effects reduce the compressor efficiency, especially at high speeds. This study identifies and analyzes the loss factors on the mass flow rate and power consumption based on experimental data, and hypothesizes possible mechanisms for each loss factor, which can aid in the design of a high-speed rotary compressor with higher efficiency.</description>

      <title>SENTINEL: Securing Indoor Localization against Adversarial Attacks with Capsule Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for edge device powered location-based services in indoor environments, Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting has become popular, given the unavailability of GPS indoors. However, achieving robust and efficient indoor localization faces several challenges, due to RSS fluctuations from dynamic changes in indoor environments and heterogeneity of edge devices, leading to diminished localization accuracy. While advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in mitigating these phenomena, it remains an open problem. Additionally, emerging threats from adversarial attacks on ML-enhanced indoor localization systems, especially those introduced by malicious or rogue access points (APs), can deceive ML models to further increase localization errors. To address these challenges, we present SENTINEL, a novel embedded ML framework utilizing modified capsule neural networks to bolster the resilience of indoor localization solutions against adversarial attacks, device heterogeneity, and dynamic RSS fluctuations. We also introduce RSSRogueLoc, a novel dataset capturing the effects of rogue APs from several real-world indoor environments. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SENTINEL achieves significant improvements, with up to 3.5x reduction in mean error and 3.4x reduction in worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art frameworks using simulated adversarial attacks. SENTINEL also achieves improvements of up to 2.8x in mean error and 2.7x in worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art frameworks when evaluated with the real-world RSSRogueLoc dataset.</description>

      <title>A neural network for forward and inverse nonlinear Fourier transforms for fiber optic communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural network for both forward and inverse continuous nonlinear Fourier transforms, NFT and INFT respectively. We demonstrate the network's capability to perform NFT and INFT for a random mix of NFDM-QAM signals. The network transformations (NFT and INFT) exhibit true characteristics of these transformations; they are significantly different for low and high-power input pulses. The network shows adequate accuracy with an RMSE of 5e-3 for forward and 3e-2 for inverse transforms. We further show that the trained network can be used to perform general nonlinear Fourier transforms on arbitrary pulses beyond the training pulse types.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrocardiogram Signal Analysis Using NLP-Inspired Techniques: A Novel Approach with Embedding and Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A language is made up of an infinite/finite number of sentences, which in turn is composed of a number of words. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most popular noninvasive medical tool for studying heart function and diagnosing various irregular cardiac rhythms. Intuitive inspection of the ECG reveals a marked similarity between ECG signals and the spoken language. As a result, the ECG signal may be thought of as a series of heartbeats (similar to sentences in a spoken language), with each heartbeat consisting of a collection of waves (similar to words in a sentence) with varying morphologies. Just as natural language processing (NLP) is used to help computers comprehend and interpret human natural language, it is conceivable to create NLP-inspired algorithms to help computers comprehend the electrocardiogram data more efficiently. In this study, we propose a novel ECG analysis technique, based on embedding and self attention, to capture the spatial as well as the temporal dependencies of the ECG data. To generate the embedding, an encoder-decoder network was proposed to capture the temporal dependencies of the ECG signal and perform data compression. The compressed and encoded data was fed to the embedding layer as its weights. Finally, the proposed CNN-LSTM-Self Attention classifier works on the embedding layer and classifies the signal as normal or anomalous. The approach was tested using the PTB-xl dataset, which is severely imbalanced. Our emphasis was to appropriately recognise the disease classes present in minority numbers, in order to limit the detection of False Negative cases. An accuracy of 91% was achieved with a good F1-score for all the disease classes. Additionally, the the size of the model was reduced by 34% due to compression, making it suitable for deployment in real time applications</description>

      <title>SSSD-ECG-nle: New Label Embeddings with Structured State-Space Models for ECG generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is vital for identifying cardiac diseases, offering crucial insights for diagnosing heart conditions and informing potentially life-saving treatments. However, like other types of medical data, ECGs are subject to privacy concerns when distributed and analyzed. Diffusion models have made significant progress in recent years, creating the possibility for synthesizing data comparable to the real one and allowing their widespread adoption without privacy concerns. In this paper, we use diffusion models with structured state spaces for generating digital 10-second 12-lead ECG signals. We propose the SSSD-ECG-nle architecture based on SSSD-ECG with a modified conditioning mechanism and demonstrate its efficiency on downstream tasks. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including analyzing convergence speed, the impact of adding positive samples, and assessment with physicians' expert knowledge. Finally, we share the results of physician evaluations and also make synthetic data available to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments described.</description>

      <title>S-RAN: Semantic-Aware Radio Access Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has been a transformative paradigm, emphasizing the precise exchange of meaningful information over traditional bit-level transmissions. However, existing SemCom research, primarily centered on simplified scenarios like single-pair transmissions with direct wireless links, faces significant challenges when applied to real-world radio access networks (RANs). This article introduces a Semantic-aware Radio Access Network (S-RAN), offering a holistic systematic view of SemCom beyond single-pair transmissions. We begin by outlining the S-RAN architecture, introducing new physical components and logical functions along with key design challenges. We then present transceiver design for end-to-end transmission to overcome conventional SemCom transceiver limitations, including static channel conditions, oversimplified background knowledge models, and hardware constraints. Later, we delve into the discussion on radio resource management for multiple users, covering semantic channel modeling, performance metrics, resource management algorithms, and a case study, to elaborate distinctions from resource management for legacy RANs. Finally, we highlight open research challenges and potential solutions. The objective of this article is to serve as a basis for advancing SemCom research into practical wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Unlike traditional SWIPT systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), our FA-assisted system enables dynamic reconfiguration of the radio propagation environment by adjusting the positions of FAs. This capability enhances both energy harvesting and communication performance. The system comprises a base station (BS) equipped with multiple FAs that transmit signals to an energy receiver (ER) and an information receiver (IR), both equipped with a single FA. Our objective is to maximize the communication rate between the BS and the IR while satisfying the harvested power requirement of the ER. This involves jointly optimizing the BS's transmit beamforming and the positions of all FAs. To address this complex convex optimization problem, we employ an alternating optimization (AO) approach, decomposing it into three sub-problems and solving them iteratively using first and second-order Taylor expansions. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed FA-assisted SWIPT system, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional FPA-based systems.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable-Intelligent-Surface Assisted Orbital-Angular-Momentum Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a kind of wavefront with helical phase, orbital angular momentum (OAM) shows the great potential to enhance the security results of wireless communications due to its unique orthogonality and central hollow electromagnetic wave structure. Therefore, in this paper we propose the reconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS) assisted OAM scheme, where RIS is deployed to weaken the information acquisition at eavesdroppers by adjusting the OAM beams pointed to the eavesdropper and artificial noise (AN) is applied to interfere with the eavesdropper, thus significantly increasing the secrecy rates of short-range secure communications. Aiming at obtaining the maximum secrecy rate, we develop the Riemannian manifold conjugate gradient (RMCG) based alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to assign much power to low-order OAM-modes and optimize the OAM beams direction with the programmable RIS, thus respectively enhancing and weakening the received signal strength at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing works in terms of the secrecy rate and the eavesdropper's bit error rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has emerged in recent years as a promising solution to the ever-increasing demand for wireless communication capacity. In practice, however, elements of RIS may suffer from phase deviations, which need to be properly estimated and calibrated. This paper models the problem of over-the-air (OTA) estimation of the RIS elements as a quasi-neural network (QNN) so that the phase estimates can be obtained using the classic backpropagation (BP) algorithm. We also derive the Cram\'{e}r Rao Bounds (CRBs) for the phases of the RIS elements as a benchmark of the proposed approach. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by showing that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the phase estimates are close to the CRBs.</description>

Abstract: Task-Oriented Semantic Communication (TOSC) has been considered as a new communication paradigm to serve various samrt devices that depend on Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks in future wireless networks. The existing TOSC frameworks rely on the Neural Network (NN) model to extract the semantic feature from the source data. The semantic feature, constituted by analog vectors of a lower dimensionality relative to the original source data, reserves the meaning of the source data. By conveying the semantic feature, TOSCs can significantly reduce the amount of data transmission while ensuring the correct execution of the AI-driven downstream task. However, standardized wireless networks depend on digital signal processing for data transmission, yet they necessitate the conveyance of semantic features that are inherently analog. Although existing TOSC frameworks developed the Deep Learning (DL) based \emph{analog approach} or conventional \emph{digital approach} to transmit the semantic feature, but there are still many challenging problems to urgently be solved in actual deployment. In this article, we first propose several challenging issues associated with the development of the TOSC framework in the standardized wireless network. Then, we develop a Digital-Analog transmission framework based TOSC (DA-TOSC) to resolve these challenging issues. Future research directions are discussed to further improve the DA-TOSC.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Driven Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-Oriented Semantic Communication (TOSC) has been regarded as a promising communication framework, serving for various Artificial Intelligence (AI) task driven applications. The existing TOSC frameworks focus on extracting the full semantic features of source data and learning low-dimensional channel inputs to transmit them within limited bandwidth resources. Although transmitting full semantic features can preserve the integrity of data meaning, this approach does not attain the performance threshold of the TOSC. In this paper, we propose a Task-oriented Adaptive Semantic Communication (TasCom) framework, which aims to effectively facilitate the execution of AI tasks by only sending task-related semantic features. In the TasCom framework, we first propose a Generative AI (GAI) architecture based Generative Joint Source-Channel Coding (G-JSCC) for efficient semantic transmission. Then, an Adaptive Coding Controller (ACC) is proposed to find the optimal coding scheme for the proposed G-JSCC, which allows the semantic features with significant contributions to the AI task to preferentially occupy limited bandwidth resources for wireless transmission. Furthermore, we propose a generative training algorithm to train the proposed TasCom for optimal performance. The simulation results show that the proposed TasCom outperforms the existing TOSC and traditional codec schemes on the object detection and instance segmentation tasks at all considered channel conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given partial measurements of a time-varying graph signal, we propose an algorithm to simultaneously estimate both the underlying graph topology and the missing measurements. The proposed algorithm operates by training an interpretable neural network, designed from the unrolling framework. The proposed technique can be used both as a graph learning and a graph signal reconstruction algorithm. This work enhances prior work in graph signal reconstruction by allowing the underlying graph to be unknown; and also builds on prior work in graph learning by tailoring the learned graph to the signal reconstruction task.</description>

      <title>RIMformer: An End-to-End Transformer for FMCW Radar Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar plays a pivotal role in the field of remote sensing. The increasing degree of FMCW radar deployment has increased the mutual interference, which weakens the detection capabilities of radars and threatens reliability and safety of systems. In this paper, a novel FMCW radar interference mitigation (RIM) method, termed as RIMformer, is proposed by using an end-to-end Transformer-based structure. In the RIMformer, a dual multi-head self-attention mechanism is proposed to capture the correlations among the distinct distance elements of intermediate frequency (IF) signals. Additionally, an improved convolutional block is integrated to harness the power of convolution for extracting local features. The architecture is designed to process time-domain IF signals in an end-to-end manner, thereby avoiding the need for additional manual data processing steps. The improved decoder structure ensures the parallelization of the network to increase its computational efficiency. Simulation and measurement experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed RIMformer can effectively mitigate interference and restore the target signals.</description>

      <title>Learning Global and Local Features of Power Load Series Through Transformer and 2D-CNN: An image-based Multi-step Forecasting Approach Incorporating Phase Space Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As modern power systems continue to evolve, accurate power load forecasting remains a critical issue. The phase space reconstruction method can effectively retain the chaotic characteristics of power load from a system dynamics perspective and thus is a promising knowledge-based preprocessing method for power load forecasting. However, limited by its fundamental theory, there is still a gap in implementing a multi-step forecasting scheme in current studies. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a novel multi-step forecasting approach by integrating the PSR with neural networks. Firstly, the useful features in the phase trajectory obtained from the preprocessing of PSR are discussed in detail. Through mathematical derivation, the equivalent characterization of the PSR and another time series preprocessing method, patch segmentation, is demonstrated for the first time. Based on this prior knowledge, an image-based modeling perspective with the global and local feature extraction strategy is introduced. Subsequently, a novel deep learning model, namely PSR-GALIEN, is designed for end-to-end processing, in which the Transformer Encoder and 2D-convolutional neural networks are employed for the extraction of the global and local patterns in the image, and a multi-layer perception based predictor is used for the efficient correlation modeling. Then, extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness as well as to have an insight into the detailed properties. The results show that, comparing it with six state-of-the-art deep learning models, the forecasting performance of PSR-GALIEN consistently surpasses these baselines, which achieves superior accuracy in both intra-day and day-ahead forecasting scenarios. At the same time, a visualization-based method is proposed to explain the attributions of the forecasting results.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses resource allocation challenges in multi-cell wireless systems catering to enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) users. We present a distributed learning framework tailored to O-RAN network architectures. Leveraging a Thompson sampling-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, our approach provides real-time resource allocation decisions, aligning with evolving network structures. The proposed approach facilitates online decision-making for resource allocation by deploying trained execution agents at Near-Real Time Radio Access Network Intelligent Controllers (Near-RT RICs) located at network edges.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of 5G and beyond, cloud-native Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) present a paradigm shift towards intelligent, flexible, and sustainable network operations. This study addresses the intricate challenge of energy efficient (EE) resource allocation that services both enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) users. We propose a novel distributed learning framework leveraging on-policy and off-policy transfer learning strategies within a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)--based model to facilitate online resource allocation decisions under different channel conditions. The simulation results explain the efficacy of the proposed method, which rapidly adapts to dynamic network states, thereby achieving a green resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Communications: A Road to Intelligent Transmission and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior to the era of artificial intelligence and big data, wireless communications primarily followed a conventional research route involving problem analysis, model building and calibration, algorithm design and tuning, and holistic and empirical verification. However, this methodology often encountered limitations when dealing with large-scale and complex problems and managing dynamic and massive data, resulting in inefficiencies and limited performance of traditional communication systems and methods. As such, wireless communications have embraced the revolutionary impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning, giving birth to more adaptive, efficient, and intelligent systems and algorithms. This technological shift opens a road to intelligent information transmission and processing. This overview article discusses the typical roles of machine learning in intelligent wireless communications, as well as its features, challenges, and practical considerations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative deep learning-based method for end-to-end target radial length estimation from HRRP (High Resolution Range Profile) sequences. Firstly, the HRRP sequences are normalized and transformed into GAF (Gram Angular Field) images to effectively capture and utilize the temporal information. Subsequently, these GAF images serve as the input for a pretrained ResNet-101 model, which is then fine-tuned for target radial length estimation. The simulation results show that compared to traditional threshold method and simple networks e.g. one-dimensional CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), the proposed method demonstrates superior noise resistance and higher accuracy under low SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) conditions.</description>

      <title>Batch SLAM with PMBM Data Association Sampling and Graph-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods need to both solve the data association (DA) problem and the joint estimation of the sensor trajectory and the map, conditioned on a DA. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated approach to solve both the DA problem and the batch SLAM problem simultaneously, combining random finite set (RFS) theory and the graph-based SLAM approach. A sampling method based on the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) density is designed for dealing with the DA uncertainty, and a graph-based SLAM solver is applied for the conditional SLAM problem. In the end, a post-processing approach is applied to merge SLAM results from different iterations. Using synthetic data, it is demonstrated that the proposed SLAM approach achieves performance close to the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound, and outperforms state-of-the-art RFS-based SLAM filters in high clutter and high process noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted High Resolution Radar Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes monostatic sensing by a user equipment (UE) for a setting in which the UE is unable to resolve multiple targets due to their interference within a single resolution bin. It is shown how sensing accuracy, in terms of both detection rate and localization accuracy, can be boosted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which can be advantageously used to provide signal diversity and aid in resolving the targets. Specifically, assuming prior information on the presence of a cluster of targets, a RIS beam sweep procedure is used to facilitate the high resolution sensing. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for channel parameter estimation and sensing and an upper bound on the detection probability. The concept of coherence is defined and analyzed theoretically. Then, we propose an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) channel estimation algorithm combined with data association to fuse the information of the non-RIS signal and the RIS signal and perform sensing. Finally, we provide numerical results to verify the potential of RIS for improving sensor resolution, and to demonstrate that the proposed methods can realize this potential for RIS-assisted high resolution sensing.</description>

      <title>Friction and Road Condition Estimation by Combining Cause- and Effect-Based Methods using Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge about the maximum tire-road friction potential is an important factor to ensure the driving stability and traffic safety of the vehicle. Many authors proposed systems that either measure friction related parameters or estimate the friction coefficient directly via a mathematical model. However these systems can be negatively impacted by environmental factors or require a sufficient level of excitation in the form of tire slip, which is often too low under practical conditions. Therefore, this work investigates, if a more robust estimation can be achieved by fusing the information of multiple systems using a Bayesian network, which models the statistical relationship between the sensors and the maximum friction coefficient. First, the Bayesian network is evaluated over its entire domain to compare the inference process to all possible road conditions. After that, the algorithm is applied to data from a test vehicle to demonstrate the performance under real conditions.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao Bound Minimization for Movable Antenna-Assisted Multiuser Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a movable antenna (MA)-assisted multiuser integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the base station (BS) and communication users are all equipped with MA for improving both the sensing and communication performance. We employ the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as the performance metric of sensing, thus a joint beamforming design and MAs' position optimizing problem is formulated to minimize the CRB. However the resulting optimization problem is NP-hard and the variables are highly coupled. To tackle this problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework by adopting semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results reveal that the proposed MA-assisted ISAC system achieves lower estimation CRB compared to the fixed-position antenna (FPA) counterpart.</description>

      <title>Learning Cellular Network Connection Quality with Conformal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of uncertainty quantification for cellular network speed. It is a well-known fact that the actual internet speed experienced by a mobile phone can fluctuate significantly, even when remaining in a single location. This high degree of variability underscores that mere point estimation of network speed is insufficient. Rather, it is advantageous to establish a prediction interval that can encompass the expected range of speed variations. In order to build an accurate network estimation map, numerous mobile data need to be collected at different locations. Currently, public datasets rely on users to upload data through apps. Although massive data has been collected, the datasets suffer from significant noise due to the nature of cellular networks and various other factors. Additionally, the uneven distribution of population density affects the spatial consistency of data collection, leading to substantial uncertainty in the network quality maps derived from this data. We focus our analysis on large-scale internet-quality datasets provided by Ookla to construct an estimated map of connection quality. To improve the reliability of this map, we introduce a novel conformal prediction technique to build an uncertainty map. We identify regions with heightened uncertainty to prioritize targeted, manual data collection. In addition, the uncertainty map quantifies how reliable the prediction is in different areas. Our method also leads to a sampling strategy that guides researchers to selectively gather high-quality data that best complement the current dataset to improve the overall accuracy of the prediction model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Digital Twin and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Network Slicing for 5G-enabled Internet of Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network slicing enables industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks with multiservice and differentiated resource requirements to meet increasing demands through efficient use and management of network resources. Typically, the network slice orchestrator relies on demand forecasts for each slice to make informed decisions and maximize resource utilization. The new generation of Industry 4.0 has introduced digital twins to map physical systems to digital models for accurate decision-making. In our approach, we first use graph-attention networks to build a digital twin environment for network slices, enabling real-time traffic analysis, monitoring, and demand forecasting. Based on these predictions, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a federated multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and employ a deep deterministic policy gradient to determine the resource allocation policy while preserving the privacy of the slices. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can improve the accuracy of demand prediction for network slices and reduce the communication overhead of dynamic network slicing.</description>

      <title>Online Multi-Task Offloading for Semantic-Aware Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides low-latency offloading solutions for computationally intensive tasks, effectively improving the computing efficiency and battery life of mobile devices. However, for data-intensive tasks or scenarios with limited uplink bandwidth, network congestion might occur due to massive simultaneous offloading nodes, increasing transmission latency and affecting task performance. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware multi-modal task offloading framework to address the challenges posed by limited uplink bandwidth. By introducing a semantic extraction factor, we balance the relationship among transmission latency, computation energy consumption, and task performance. To measure the offloading performance of multi-modal tasks, we design a unified and fair quality of experience (QoE) metric that includes execution latency, energy consumption, and task performance. Lastly, we formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and exploit the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) reinforcement learning algorithm to jointly optimize the semantic extraction factor, communication resources, and computing resources to maximize overall QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a reduction in execution latency and energy consumption of 18.1% and 12.9%, respectively compared with the semantic-unaware approach. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to models with different user preferences.</description>

      <title>Purification Of Contaminated Convolutional Neural Networks Via Robust Recovery: An Approach with Theoretical Guarantee in One-Hidden-Layer Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one of the key architectures of deep learning models, have achieved superior performance on many machine learning tasks such as image classification, video recognition, and power systems. Despite their success, CNNs can be easily contaminated by natural noises and artificially injected noises such as backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose a robust recovery method to remove the noise from the potentially contaminated CNNs and provide an exact recovery guarantee on one-hidden-layer non-overlapping CNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. Our theoretical results show that both CNNs' weights and biases can be exactly recovered under the overparameterization setting with some mild assumptions. The experimental results demonstrate the correctness of the proofs and the effectiveness of the method in both the synthetic environment and the practical neural network setting. Our results also indicate that the proposed method can be extended to multiple-layer CNNs and potentially serve as a defense strategy against backdoor attacks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open source simulator for packet routing in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations (LSatCs) considering the dynamic system uncertainties. The simulator, implemented in Python, supports traditional Dijkstra's based routing as well as more advanced learning solutions, specifically Q-Routing and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) from our previous work. It uses an event-based approach with the SimPy module to accurately simulate packet creation, routing and queuing, providing real-time tracking of queues and latency. The simulator is highly configurable, allowing adjustments in routing policies, traffic, ground and space layer topologies, communication parameters, and learning hyperparameters. Key features include the ability to visualize system motion and track packet paths. Results highlight significant improvements in end-to-end (E2E) latency using Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based routing policies compared to traditional methods. The source code, the documentation and a Jupyter notebook with post-processing results and analysis are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Robust Score-Based Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work employs a pair of "least-favorable" distributions to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Mix-and-Conquer: Beamforming Design with Interconnected RIS for Multi-User Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) structure, referred to as interconnected RIS (I-RIS), which allows the RIS elements to be interconnected and share the incident signals using simple binary radio frequency (RF) switches and mix them into the reflecting signals. This structure enables multi-user scaling and requires fewer elements (i.e., a compact structure) compared to standard RIS (S-RIS), which assumes no interconnection between the elements. The I-RIS compact design makes it practical for deployment on space-limited nodes, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Hence, in this work, we propose a beamforming design based on I-RIS in a multi-user network, where we use binary RF switches as RIS elements. We show that our switch-based I-RIS offers a higher gain compared to an S-RIS using phase shifters. Finally, we introduce two optimization methods, sigmoid filled function (SFF) and semi-definite binary optimization (SBO), to optimize the RIS elements and evaluate their performance in terms of sum-rate and complexity.</description>

      <title>Spatial-spectral Cell-free Networks: A Large-scale Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the large-scale cell-free networks where dense distributed access points (APs) serve many users. As a promising next-generation network architecture, cell-free networks enable ultra-reliable connections and minimal fading/blockage, which are much favorable to the millimeter wave and Terahertz transmissions. However, conventional beam management with large phased arrays in a cell is very time-consuming in the higher-frequencies, and could be worsened when deploying a large number of coordinated APs in the cell-free systems. To tackle this challenge, the spatial-spectral cell-free networks with the leaky-wave antennas are established by coupling the propagation angles with frequencies. The beam training overhead in this direction can be significantly reduced through exploiting such spatial-spectral coupling effects. In the considered large-scale spatial-spectral cell-free networks, a novel subchannel allocation solution at sub-terahertz bands is proposed by leveraging the relationship between cross-entropy method and mixture model. Since initial access and AP clustering play a key role in achieving scalable large-scale cell-free networks, a hierarchical AP clustering solution is proposed to make the joint initial access and cluster formation, which is adaptive and has no need to initialize the number of AP clusters. After AP clustering, a subchannel allocation solution is devised to manage the interference between AP clusters. Numerical results are presented to confirm the efficiency of the proposed solutions and indicate that besides subchannel allocation, AP clustering can also have a big impact on the large-scale cell-free network performance at sub-terahertz bands.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Masked Autoencoder and Comprehensive Evaluations for Reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from Arbitrary Single-Lead ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that exhibit an elevated prevalence and mortality, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a popular and standard diagnostic tool for doctors, commonly utilizing a 12-lead configuration in clinical practice. However, the 10 electrodes placed on the surface would cause a lot of inconvenience and discomfort, while the rapidly advancing wearable devices adopt the reduced-lead or single-lead ECG to reduce discomfort as a solution in long-term monitoring. Since the single-lead ECG is a subset of 12-lead ECG, it provides insufficient cardiac health information and plays a substandard role in real-world healthcare applications. Hence, it is necessary to utilize signal generation technologies to reduce their clinical importance gap by reconstructing 12-lead ECG from the real single-lead ECG. Specifically, this study proposes a multi-channel masked autoencoder (MCMA) for this goal. In the experimental results, the visualized results between the generated and real signals can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. At the same time, this study introduces a comprehensive evaluation benchmark named ECGGenEval, encompassing the signal-level, feature-level, and diagnostic-level evaluations, providing a holistic assessment of 12-lead ECG signals and generative model. Further, the quantitative experimental results are as follows, the mean square errors of 0.0178 and 0.0658, correlation coefficients of 0.7698 and 0.7237 in the signal-level evaluation, the average F1-score with two generated 12-lead ECG is 0.8319 and 0.7824 in the diagnostic-level evaluation, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. The open-source code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CHENJIAR3/MCMA}.</description>

      <title>Building Resilience in Wireless Communication Systems With a Secret-Key Budget</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilience and power consumption are two important performance metrics for many modern communication systems, and it is therefore important to define, analyze, and optimize them. In this work, we consider a wireless communication system with secret-key generation, in which the secret-key bits are added to and used from a pool of available key bits. We propose novel physical layer resilience metrics for the survivability of such systems. In addition, we propose multiple power allocation schemes and analyze their trade-off between resilience and power consumption. In particular, we investigate and compare constant power allocation, an adaptive analytical algorithm, and a reinforcement learning-based solution. It is shown how the transmit power can be minimized such that a specified resilience is guaranteed. These results can be used directly by designers of such systems to optimize the system parameters for the desired performance in terms of reliability, security, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Statistical Reachability Analysis of Stochastic Cyber-Physical Systems under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reachability analysis is a popular method to give safety guarantees for stochastic cyber-physical systems (SCPSs) that takes in a symbolic description of the system dynamics and uses set-propagation methods to compute an overapproximation of the set of reachable states over a bounded time horizon. In this paper, we investigate the problem of performing reachability analysis for an SCPS that does not have a symbolic description of the dynamics, but instead is described using a digital twin model that can be simulated to generate system trajectories. An important challenge is that the simulator implicitly models a probability distribution over the set of trajectories of the SCPS; however, it is typical to have a sim2real gap, i.e., the actual distribution of the trajectories in a deployment setting may be shifted from the distribution assumed by the simulator. We thus propose a statistical reachability analysis technique that, given a user-provided threshold $1-\epsilon$, provides a set that guarantees that any reachable state during deployment lies in this set with probability not smaller than this threshold. Our method is based on three main steps: (1) learning a deterministic surrogate model from sampled trajectories, (2) conducting reachability analysis over the surrogate model, and (3) employing {\em robust conformal inference} using an additional set of sampled trajectories to quantify the surrogate model's distribution shift with respect to the deployed SCPS. To counter conservatism in reachable sets, we propose a novel method to train surrogate models that minimizes a quantile loss term (instead of the usual mean squared loss), and a new method that provides tighter guarantees using conformal inference using a normalized surrogate error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on various case studies.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Grouping Index Modulation Design for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Index modulation (IM) significantly enhances the spectral efficiency of fluid antennas (FAs) enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is named FA-IM. However, due to the dense distribution of ports on fluid antennas, the wireless channel exhibits a high spatial correlation, resulting in severe performance degradation in the existing FA-IM scheme. This paper proposes a novel fluid antenna grouping index modulation (FA-GIM) scheme to mitigate the spatial correlation of the FA-IM channel, further enhancing system performance. Based on the spatial correlation model of two-dimensional (2D) fluid antenna surfaces, this paper specifically adopts a block grouping method where adjacent ports are allocated to the same group. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the state-of-the-art scheme, enhancing the robustness of FA-assisted MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for word embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs), which are crucial for language understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming LLM word embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using BERT and RoBERTa models demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and datasets. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the LLM's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.</description>

      <title>Snail-Radar: A large-scale diverse dataset for the evaluation of 4D-radar-based SLAM systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4D radars are increasingly favored for odometry and mapping of autonomous systems due to their robustness in harsh weather and dynamic environments. Existing datasets, however, often cover limited areas and are typically captured using a single platform. To address this gap, we present a diverse large-scale dataset specifically designed for 4D radar-based localization and mapping. This dataset was gathered using three different platforms: a handheld device, an e-bike, and an SUV, under a variety of environmental conditions, including clear days, nighttime, and heavy rain. The data collection occurred from September 2023 to February 2024, encompassing diverse settings such as roads in a vegetated campus and tunnels on highways. Each route was traversed multiple times to facilitate place recognition evaluations. The sensor suite included a 3D lidar, 4D radars, stereo cameras, consumer-grade IMUs, and a GNSS/INS system. Sensor data packets were synchronized to GNSS time using a two-step process: a convex hull algorithm was applied to smooth host time jitter, and then odometry and correlation algorithms were used to correct constant time offsets. Extrinsic calibration between sensors was achieved through manual measurements and subsequent nonlinear optimization. The reference motion for the platforms was generated by registering lidar scans to a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud map using a lidar inertial odometry (LIO) method in localization mode. Additionally, a data reversion technique was introduced to enable backward LIO processing. We believe this dataset will boost research in radar-based point cloud registration, odometry, mapping, and place recognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many parts of human body generate internal sound during biological processes, which are rich sources of information for understanding health and wellbeing. Despite a long history of development and usage of stethoscopes, there is still a lack of proper tools for recording internal body sound together with complementary sensors for long term monitoring. In this paper, we show our development of a wearable electronic stethoscope, coined Patchkeeper (PK), that can be used for internal body sound recording over long periods of time. Patchkeeper also integrates several state-of-the-art biological sensors, including electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. As a wearable device, Patchkeeper can be placed on various parts of the body to collect sound from particular organs, including heart, lung, stomach, and joints etc. We show in this paper that several vital signals can be recorded simultaneously with high quality. As Patchkeeper can be operated directly by the user, e.g. without involving health care professionals, we believe it could be a useful tool for telemedicine and remote diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next generation communication and sensing require enabling technologies for miniaturized and efficient heterogeneous systems while integrating technologies ranging from silicon to compound semiconductors and from photonic chips to micro-sensors. To this end, high frequency and mm-wave (MMW) lossy parasitics and delay between modules need to be significantly reduced to minimize area, loss and thermal heating of inter-chip wiring and power delivery networks. In this work, we propose novel approaches to achieve an efficient wideband MMW array integrations. The proposed techniques are built upon the following: 1) fixed antenna package buildup for every element with differential excitation on two half sides of array to reduce the fabrication cost and the IC-to-antenna routing loss; 2) miniaturized aperture coupled local oscillator (LO) and intermediate frequency (IF) power delivery feed distribution to minimize the packaging stacked layers and their loss. The proposed 16-element antenna array is integrated which 4 dies in 2x2 configurations implemented in a 90-nm SiGe BiCMOS process using compact Weaver image-selection architecture (WISA). The proposed miniaturized and efficient architecture from circuit and chip level to package level results in 1.5 GHz modulation bandwidth for 64 QAM (9 Gb/s) and 2 GHz for 16 QAM with only +-2 dB EVM variation over the 20% FBW (71-86 GHz). The system produces 30-dBm EIRP with enhanced efficiency of 25% EIRP/PDC over the bandwidth</description>

Abstract: SARComm is a novel wireless communication system that enables passive satellite backscatter connectivity using existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals. We demonstrate that SAR signals from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite, used to image Earth's terrain, can be leveraged to enable low-power ground-to-satellite communication. This paper presents the first cooperative, on-the-ground target that modulates SAR backscatter to send information bits and analyzes how to extract them from publicly available Sentinel-1 datasets. To demonstrate the system, we evaluate the effectiveness of modulating the radar cross section of corner reflectors both mechanically and electronically to encode data bits, develop a deployment algorithm to optimize corner reflector placement, and present a SAR processing pipeline to enable communication.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Wave-Number Domain Expression for Near-Field XL-MIMO Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Extremely Large-Scale Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (XL-MIMO) technology advances and carrier frequency rises, the near-field effects in communication are intensifying. A concise and accurate near-field XL-MIMO channel model serves as the cornerstone for investigating the near-field effects. However, existing wave-number domain XL-MIMO channel models under near-field conditions require non-closed-form oscillatory integrals for computation, making it difficult to analyze the channel characteristics in closed-form. To obtain a more succinct channel model, this paper introduces a closed-form approximate expression based on the principle of stationary phase. It was subsequently shown that when the scatterer distance is larger than the array aperture, the closed-form model can be further simplified as a trapezoidal spectrum. We validate the accuracy of the proposed approximation through simulations of power angular spectrum similarity. The results indicate that the proposed approximation can accurately approximate the near-field wave-number domain channel within the effective Rayleigh distance.</description>

Abstract: In Extended Reality (XR) applications, high data rates and low latency are crucial for immersive experiences. Uplink transmission in XR is challenging due to the limited antennas and power of lightweight XR devices. To improve data transmission rates, we investigate a relay-assisted carrier aggregation (RACA) system. The XR device simultaneously transmits data to an access point (AP) and a relay in proximity over low-frequency and high-frequency bands, respectively. Then, the relay down-converts and amplifies the signals to the AP, effectively acting as an additional transmit antenna for the XR device. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to maximize the data rate of the XR device in their respective protocols. In the centralized protocol, the rate maximization problem is equivalently transformed as a weighted mean square error minimization (WMMSE) problem which can be solved iteratively by alternative optimization. In the distributed protocol, the rate maximization problem is decomposed into two independent sub-problems where the rate of the direct link and the rate of the relay link are maximized by singular value decomposition (SVD)-based methods with water-filling (WF). Simulation results show that the rate of the RACA system is improved by $32\%$ compared to that of the conventional carrier aggregation scheme.</description>

Abstract: Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials and their polaritons with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy in recent years. One of the main challenges lies in the ability to retrieve extremely weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information. Here, we present Free-Electron Ramsey Imaging (FERI), a microscopy approach based on light-induced electron modulation that enables coherent amplification of optical near-fields in electron imaging. We provide simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurements of a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane visualizing the sub-cycle dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The phase-resolved measurements reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak field intensities in the order of ~W/cm2, corresponding to field amplitudes of a few kV/m. As a result, our work paves the way for spatio-temporal electron microscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials, exciting yet delicate samples that are currently difficult to investigate.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

      <title>Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</title>

Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements.
  We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</description>
