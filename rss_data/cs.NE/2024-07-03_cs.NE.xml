      <title>Parameter Tuning of the Firefly Algorithm by Standard Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all optimization algorithms have algorithm-dependent parameters, and the setting of such parameter values can significantly influence the behavior of the algorithm under consideration. Thus, proper parameter tuning should be carried out to ensure that the algorithm used for optimization performs well and is sufficiently robust for solving different types of optimization problems. In this study, the Firefly Algorithm (FA) is used to evaluate the influence of its parameter values on its efficiency. Parameter values are randomly initialized using both the standard Monte Carlo method and the Quasi Monte-Carlo method. The values are then used for tuning the FA. Two benchmark functions and a spring design problem are used to test the robustness of the tuned FA. From the preliminary findings, it can be deduced that both the Monte Carlo method and Quasi-Monte Carlo method produce similar results in terms of optimal fitness values. Numerical experiments using the two different methods on both benchmark functions and the spring design problem showed no major variations in the final fitness values, irrespective of the different sample values selected during the simulations. This insensitivity indicates the robustness of the FA.</description>

      <title>Compressed Latent Replays for Lightweight Continual Learning on Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) has been intensely investigated in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, its application in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) has not been explored in depth. In this paper we introduce the first memory-efficient implementation of Latent Replay (LR)-based CL for SNNs, designed to seamlessly integrate with resource-constrained devices. LRs combine new samples with latent representations of previously learned data, to mitigate forgetting. Experiments on the Heidelberg SHD dataset with Sample and Class-Incremental tasks reach a Top-1 accuracy of 92.5% and 92%, respectively, without forgetting the previously learned information. Furthermore, we minimize the LRs' requirements by applying a time-domain compression, reducing by two orders of magnitude their memory requirement, with respect to a naive rehearsal setup, with a maximum accuracy drop of 4%. On a Multi-Class-Incremental task, our SNN learns 10 new classes from an initial set of 10, reaching a Top-1 accuracy of 78.4% on the full test set.</description>

      <title>MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a medical imaging technique that captures scalp electrical activity of brain structures via electrodes, has been widely used in affective computing. The spatial domain of EEG is rich in affective information.However, few of the existing studies have simultaneously analyzed EEG signals from multiple perspectives of geometric and anatomical structures in spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-view Graph Transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations, which integrates information from the temporal, frequency and spatial domains, including geometric and anatomical structures, so as to enhance the expressive power of the model comprehensively.We incorporate the spatial information of EEG channels into the model as encoding, thereby improving its ability to perceive the spatial structure of the channels. Meanwhile, experimental results based on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recent years. In addition, the results also show that the MVGT could extract information from multiple domains and capture inter-channel relationships in EEG emotion recognition tasks effectively.</description>

      <title>Wildfire Autonomous Response and Prediction Using Cellular Automata (WARP-CA)</title>

Abstract: Wildfires pose a severe challenge to ecosystems and human settlements, exacerbated by climate change and environmental factors. Traditional wildfire modeling, while useful, often fails to adapt to the rapid dynamics of such events. This report introduces the (Wildfire Autonomous Response and Prediction Using Cellular Automata) WARP-CA model, a novel approach that integrates terrain generation using Perlin noise with the dynamism of Cellular Automata (CA) to simulate wildfire spread. We explore the potential of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to manage wildfires by simulating autonomous agents, such as UAVs and UGVs, within a collaborative framework. Our methodology combines world simulation techniques and investigates emergent behaviors in MARL, focusing on efficient wildfire suppression and considering critical environmental factors like wind patterns and terrain features.</description>

      <title>Semantically Rich Local Dataset Generation for Explainable AI in Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black box deep learning models trained on genomic sequences excel at predicting the outcomes of different gene regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, interpreting these models may provide novel insights into the underlying biology, supporting downstream biomedical applications. Due to their complexity, interpretable surrogate models can only be built for local explanations (e.g., a single instance). However, accomplishing this requires generating a dataset in the neighborhood of the input, which must maintain syntactic similarity to the original data while introducing semantic variability in the model's predictions. This task is challenging due to the complex sequence-to-function relationship of DNA.
  We propose using Genetic Programming to generate datasets by evolving perturbations in sequences that contribute to their semantic diversity. Our custom, domain-guided individual representation effectively constrains syntactic similarity, and we provide two alternative fitness functions that promote diversity with no computational effort. Applied to the RNA splicing domain, our approach quickly achieves good diversity and significantly outperforms a random baseline in exploring the search space, as shown by our proof-of-concept, short RNA sequence. Furthermore, we assess its generalizability and demonstrate scalability to larger sequences, resulting in a $\approx$30\% improvement over the baseline.</description>

      <title>Combining AI Control Systems and Human Decision Support via Robustness and Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-enabled capabilities are reaching the requisite level of maturity to be deployed in the real world, yet do not always make correct or safe decisions. One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training / learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training / learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time.</description>

      <title>Scaling SNNs Trained Using Equilibrium Propagation to Convolutional Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically plausible local learning algorithm initially developed for convergent recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where weight updates rely solely on the connecting neuron states across two phases. The gradient calculations in EP have been shown to approximate the gradients computed by Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when an infinitesimally small nudge factor is used. This property makes EP a powerful candidate for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are commonly trained by BPTT. However, in the spiking domain, previous studies on EP have been limited to architectures involving few linear layers. In this work, for the first time we provide a formulation for training convolutional spiking convergent RNNs using EP, bridging the gap between spiking and non-spiking convergent RNNs. We demonstrate that for spiking convergent RNNs, there is a mismatch in the maximum pooling and its inverse operation, leading to inaccurate gradient estimation in EP. Substituting this with average pooling resolves this issue and enables accurate gradient estimation for spiking convergent RNNs. We also highlight the memory efficiency of EP compared to BPTT. In the regime of SNNs trained by EP, our experimental results indicate state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, with test errors of 0.97% and 8.89%, respectively. These results are comparable to those of convergent RNNs and SNNs trained by BPTT. These findings underscore EP as an optimal choice for on-chip training and a biologically-plausible method for computing error gradients.</description>
