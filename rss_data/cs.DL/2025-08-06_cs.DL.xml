      <title>Who Gets Cited? Gender- and Majority-Bias in LLM-Driven Reference Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation, yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool. These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into high-stakes academic workflows.</description>

      <title>Towards a Manifesto for Cyber Humanities: Paradigms, Ethics, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated evolution of digital infrastructures and algorithmic systems is reshaping how the humanities engage with knowledge and culture. Rooted in the traditions of Digital Humanities and Digital Humanism, the concept of "Cyber Humanities" proposes a critical reconfiguration of humanistic inquiry for the post-digital era. This Manifesto introduces a flexible framework that integrates ethical design, sustainable digital practices, and participatory knowledge systems grounded in human-centered approaches. By means of a Decalogue of foundational principles, the Manifesto invites the scientific community to critically examine and reimagine the algorithmic infrastructures that influence culture, creativity, and collective memory.
  Rather than being a simple extension of existing practices, "Cyber Humanities" should be understood as a foundational paradigm for humanistic inquiry in a computationally mediated world.

      <title>Arab Spring's Impact on Science through the Lens of Scholarly Attention, Funding, and Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2010-2011 Arab Spring reverberated far beyond politics, reshaping how the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) is studied. Analyzing 3.7 million Scopus-indexed articles published between 2002 and 2019, we find that mentions of ten of these countries in titles or abstracts rose significantly after 2011 relative to the global baseline, with Egypt receiving the greatest attention in the region. We link this surge to two intertwined mechanisms: an increase in research funding directed at the MENA region and the emigration of researchers who continued publishing on their countries of origin. Our analysis reveals that Saudi Arabia has emerged as a regional hub for studying the affected countries, attracting funding and scholars, and thereby playing a significant role in shaping the scientific narrative on the region. These findings demonstrate how political upheaval can reshape global knowledge flows by altering who studies whom, with what resources, and in which disciplines.</description>

      <title>A Foundational Schema.org Mapping for a Legal Knowledge Graph: Representing Brazilian Legal Norms as FRBR Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structuring legal norms for machine readability is a critical prerequisite for building advanced AI and information retrieval systems, such as Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs). Grounded in the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) model, this paper proposes a foundational mapping for the abstract legal Work - which is materialized as the Norm node in our legal Graph RAG framework - to the interoperable schema.org/Legislation vocabulary. Using the Normas.leg.br portal as a practical case study, we demonstrate how to describe this Work entity via JSON-LD, considering stable URN identifiers, inter-norm relationships, and lifecycle properties. This structured, formal approach provides the essential first step toward creating a deterministic and verifiable knowledge graph, which can serve as a formalized "ground truth" for Legal AI applications, overcoming the limitations of purely probabilistic models.</description>
