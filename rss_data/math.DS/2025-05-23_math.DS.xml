      <title>Continuum limit of the Kuramoto model with random natural frequencies on uniform graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) having random natural frequencies and defined on uniform graphs that may be complete, random dense or random sparse. The natural frequencies are independent and identically distributed on a bounded interval. In the previous work, the corresponding continuum limit (CL) was proven to approximate stable motions in the KM well when the natural frequencies are deterministic, even if the graph is not uniform, although it may not do so for unstable motions and bifurcations. We show that the method of CLs is still valid even when the natural frequencies are random, especially uniformly distributed. In particular, an asymptotically stable family of solutions to the CL is proven to behave in the $L^2$ sense as if it is an asymptotically stable one in the KM, under an appropriate uniform random permutation. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with uniformly distributed random natural frequencies.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium States, Zero Temperature Limits and Entropy Continuity for Almost-Additive Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study the equilibrium states for almost-additive potentials defined over topologically mixing countable Markov shifts (that is a non-compact space) without the big images and preimages (BIP) property. Let $\F$ be an almost-additive and summable potential with bounded variation potential. We prove that there exists an unique equilibrium state $\mu_{t\F}$ for each $t&gt;1$ and there exists an accumulation point $\mu_{\infty}$ for the family $(\mu_{t\F})_{t&gt;1}$ as $t\to\infty$. We also obtain that the Gurevich pressure $P_{G}(t\F)$ is $C^1$ on $(1,\infty)$ and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy $h(\mu_{t\F})$ is continuous at $(1,\infty)$. As two applications, we extend completely the results for the zero temperature limit [J. Stat. Phys. ,155 (2014),pp. 23-46] and entropy continuity at infinity [J. Stat. Phys., 126 (2007),pp. 315-324] beyond the finitely primitive case. We also extend the result [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 370 (2018), pp. 8451-8465] for almost-additive potentials.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium steady state for a three-mode energy cascade model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the central phenomenon of energy cascades in wave turbulence theory, we construct non-equilibrium statistical steady states (NESS), or invariant measures, for a simplified model derived from the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation with external forcing and dissipation. This new perspective to studying energy cascades, distinct from traditional analyses based on kinetic equations and their cascade spectra, focuses on the underlying statistical steady state that is expected to hold when the cascade spectra of wave turbulence manifest.
  In the full generality of the (infinite dimensional) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, constructing such invariant measures is more involved than the rigorous justification of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) spectra, which itself remains an outstanding open question despite the recent progress on mathematical wave turbulence. Since such complexity remains far beyond the current knowledge (even for much simpler chain models), we confine our analysis to a three-mode reduced system that captures the resonant dynamics of the NLS equation, offering a tractable framework for constructing the NESS. For this, we introduce a novel approach based on solving an elliptic Feynman-Kac equation to construct the needed Lyapunov function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Echo-State Networks to predict the time series and statistical properties of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model in the chaotic regime. In particular, we demonstrate that Echo-State Networks successfully learn the chaotic attractor of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model and reproduce histograms of dependent variables, including tails and rare events. We use the Generalized Extreme Value distribution to quantify the tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic collocation schemes for Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyse numerical schemes for uncertainty quantification in neural field equations subject to random parametric data in the synaptic kernel, firing rate, external stimulus, and initial conditions. The schemes combine a generic projection method for spatial discretisation to a stochastic collocation scheme for the random variables. We study the problem in operator form, and derive estimates for the total error of the schemes, in terms of the spatial projector. We give conditions on the projected random data which guarantee analyticity of the semi-discrete solution as a Banach-valued function. We illustrate how to verify hypotheses starting from analytic random data and a choice of spatial projection. We provide evidence that the predicted convergence rates are found in various numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear neural field problems.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for Patterson--Sullivan systems with applications to random walks and entropy rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Patterson--Sullivan systems, which consist of a group action on a compact metrizable space and a quasi-invariant measure which behaves like a classical Patterson--Sullivan measure. For such systems we prove a generalization of Tukia's measurable boundary rigidity theorem. We then apply this generalization to (1) study the singularity conjecture for Patterson--Sullivan measures (or, conformal densities) and stationary measures of random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups, and discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups; (2) prove versions of Tukia's theorem for word hyperbolic groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and higher rank symmetric spaces; and (3) prove an entropy rigidity result for pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>The Graded Classification Conjecture holds for graphs with disjoint cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Graded Classification Conjecture (GCC) states that the pointed $K_0^{\operatorname{gr}}$-group is a complete invariant of the Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs when these algebras are considered with their natural grading by $\mathbb Z.$ The conjecture has previously been shown to hold in some special cases. The main result of the paper shows that the GCC holds for a significantly more general class of graphs included in the class of graphs with disjoint cycles. In particular, our result holds for finite graphs with disjoint cycles. We show the main result also for graph $C^*$-algebras. As a consequence, the graded version of the Isomorphism Conjecture holds for the class of graphs we consider.
  Besides showing the conjecture for the class of graphs we consider, we realize the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-group isomorphism by a specific graded $*$-isomorphism. In particular, we introduce a series of graph operations which preserve the graded $*$-isomorphism class of their algebras. After performing these operations on a graph, we obtain well-behaved ``representative'' graphs, which we call canonical forms. We consider an equivalence relation $\approx$ on graphs such that $E\approx F$ holds when there are isomorphic canonical forms of $E$ and $F$. In the main result, we show that the relation $E\approx F$ is equivalent to the existence of an isomorphism $f$ of the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-groups of the algebras of $E$ and $F$ in the appropriate category. As $E\approx F$ can be realized by a finite series of specific graph operations, any such isomorphism $f$ can be realized by {\em an explicit graded $*$-algebra isomorphism}. Thus, our main result describes the graded ($*$-)isomorphism classes of the algebras of graphs we consider. Besides its possible relevance in symbolic dynamics, such a description is relevant for the active program of classification of graph $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we proposed a stochastic version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, and gave a criterion for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the stochastic model on an open submanifold of the Euclidean space, by which we show that the solutions of our stochastic model are well-defined and unique. We also prove the invariance of the submanifold, which is a biologically feasible result. The asymptotic estimates of the solution are obtained, indicating the at most exponential growth of the population. Some numerical experiments are performed and illustrate the discrepancy between the deterministic and stochastic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reactivity, contractivity, and Lyapunov exponents are powerful tools for studying the stability properties of dynamical systems and have been extensively investigated in the literature for decades. In this paper, we review and extend the concepts of reactivity, contractivity, and finite-time Lyapunov exponents for discrete-time dynamical systems and establish connections among them. We focus on time-invariant maps, time-varying linear maps, and certain classes of time-varying nonlinear maps. In particular, we show that if the corresponding $p$-iteration systems (with p &gt; 1) are contractive, then the original systems admit stable attractors such as fixed points or limit cycles. We demonstrate the application of these results to the analysis of synchronization stability in coupled networks and discuss how p-iteration systems can serve as a useful framework for studying network synchronization.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamic Network Model of the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes to model the space environment as a stochastic dynamic network where each node is a group of objects of a given class, or species, and their relationship is represented by stochastic links. A set of stochastic dynamic equations, governing the evolution of the network, are derived from the network structure and topology. It will be shown that the proposed system of stochastic dynamic equations well reproduces existing results on the evolution of the space environment. The analysis of the structure of the network and relationships among node can help to understand which species of objects and orbit regimes are more critical and affect the most the future evolution of the space environment. In analogy with ecological networks, we develop a theory of the carrying capacity of space based on the stability of equilibria of the network dynamics. Some examples are presented starting from the current population of resident objects and different launch traffic forecast models. It will be shown how the proposed network model can be used to study the effect of the adoption of different policies on the execution of collision avoidance and post mission disposal manoeuvres.</description>

Abstract: For the evolutionary Stokes problem with dynamic boundary conditions, we show the maximal regularity of weak solutions in time. Due to the characterization of $R$-sectorial operators on Hilbert spaces, the proof reduces to identifying the appropriate functional analytic setting and proving that the corresponding operator is sectorial, i.e., that it generates an analytic semigroup.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Neighborhood Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize bounded-confidence models (BCMs) of opinion dynamics by incorporating neighborhood effects. In a BCM, interacting agents influence each other through dyadic influence if their opinions are sufficiently similar to each other. In our "neighborhood BCMs" (NBCMs), interacting agents are influenced both by each other's opinions and by the opinions of the agents in each other's neighborhoods. Our NBCMs thus include both the usual dyadic influence between agents and a "transitive influence", which encodes the influence of an agent's neighbors, when determining whether or not an interaction changes the opinions of agents. In this transitive influence, an individual's opinion is influenced by a neighbor when, on average, the opinions of the neighbor's neighbors are sufficiently similar to its own opinion. We formulate both neighborhood Deffuant--Weisbuch (NDW) and neighborhood Hegselmann--Krause (NHK) BCMs.
  We build further on our NBCMs by introducing a neighborhood-based network adaptation in which a network coevolves with agent opinions by changing its structure through "transitive homophily". In this network evolution, an agent breaks a tie to one of its neighbors and then rewires that tie to a new agent, with a preference for agents with a mean neighbor opinion that is closer to its own opinion. Using numerical simulations on a variety of types of networks, we explore how the qualitative opinion dynamics and network properties of our adaptive NDW model change as we adjust the relative proportions of dyadic and transitive influence. In our numerical experiments, we find that incorporating neighborhood effects into the opinion dynamics and the network-adaptation rewiring strategy tends to reduce the spectral gap and degree assortativity of networks.

Abstract: Consider a symplectic surface in a three-dimensional contact manifold with boundary on Reeb orbits (periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field). We assume that the rotation numbers of the boundary Reeb orbits satisfy a certain inequality, and we also make a technical assumption that the Reeb vector field has a particular ``nice'' form near the boundary of the surface. We then show that there exist Reeb orbits which intersect the interior of the surface, with a lower bound on the frequency of these intersections in terms of the symplectic area of the surface and the contact volume of the three-manifold. No genericity of the contact form is assumed. As a corollary of the main result, we obtain a generalization of various recent results relating the mean action of periodic orbits to the Calabi invariant for area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms.</description>
