      <title>Converging/diverging self-similar shock waves: from collapse to reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the continuation problem for the non-isentropic Euler equations following the collapse of an imploding shock wave. More precisely, we prove that the self-similar G\"uderley imploding shock solutions for a perfect gas with adiabatic exponent $\gamma\in(1,3]$ admit a self-similar extension consisting of two regions of smooth flow separated by an outgoing spherically symmetric shock wave of finite strength. In addition, for $\gamma\in(1,\frac53]$, we show that there is a unique choice of shock wave that gives rise to a globally defined self-similar flow with physical state at the spatial origin.</description>

      <title>Long time regularity of the $p$-Gauss curvature flow with flat side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the long time regularity of the interface in the $p$-Gauss curvature flow with flat side in all dimensions for $p&gt;\frac1n$. Here the interface is the boundary of the flat part in the flow. In dimension $2$, this problem was solved in \cite{DL2004} for $p=1$ and in \cite{KimLeeRhee2013} for $p\in(1/2,1)$. We utilize the duality method to transform the Gauss curvature flow to a singular parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation, and prove the regularity of the interface by studying the asymptotic cone of the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation in the polar coordinates.</description>

      <title>Collision of two solitons for $1d$ Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with same mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to several one-dimensional models such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equations in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Cauchy problem for the dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equation where $0&lt;\alpha \leq 1$ \begin{eqnarray*} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \partial_t u+|\partial_x|^{1+\alpha}\partial_x u+uu_x=0,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x), \end{array} \right. \end{eqnarray*} is $C^2$ locally well-posed in the Fourier-Lebesgue space $\widehat{H}^{s}_{r}(\mathbb{R})$. This is proved via Picard iteration arguments using $X^{s,b}$-type space adapted to the Fourier-Lebesgue space, inspired by the work of Gr\"unrock and Vega. We also proved the ill-posedness result that shows the range is sharp. Note that, previously, Molinet, Saut and Tzvetkov \cite{MST2001} proved that the solution map is not $C^2$ in $H^s$ for any $s$ if $0\leq \alpha&lt;1$. However, in the Fourier-Lebesgue space, we have a stronger smoothing effect to handle the $high\times low$ interactions.</description>

      <title>New regularity criteria for NSE and SQG in critical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some priori estimates to provide the critical regularity criteria for incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and super critical surface quasi-geostrophic equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$. Concerning the Navier-Stokes equation, we demonstrate that a Leray-Hopf solution $u$ is regular if $u\in L_T^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}} \dot{B}^{-\alpha}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, or $u$ in Lorentz space $ L_T^{p,r} \dot{B}^{-1+\frac{2}{p}}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, with $4\leq p\leq r&lt;\infty$. Additionally, an alternative regularity condition is expressed as $u\in L_{T}^{\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}
  \dot{B}^{-\alpha}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)+{L_T^\infty\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$($\alpha\in(0,1)$), contingent upon a smallness assumption on the norm $L_T^\infty\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$. For the SQG equation, we derive that a Leray-Hopf weak solution $\theta\in L_T^{\frac{\alpha}{\varepsilon}} \dot{C}^{1-\alpha+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is smooth for any $\varepsilon$ small enough. Similar to the case of Navier-Stokes equation, we derive regularity criterion in more refined spaces, i.e. Lorentz spaces $L_T^{\frac{\alpha}{\epsilon},r}\dot{C}^{1-\alpha+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and addition of two critical spaces $L_{T}^{\frac{\alpha}{\epsilon}}\dot{C}^{1-\alpha+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^2)+{L_T^\infty\dot{C}^{1-\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^2)}$, with smallness assumption on $L_T^\infty\dot{C}^{1-\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^2)$.</description>

      <title>Calculus of variations on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have established a coherent framework for applying variational methods to partial differential equations on hypergraphs, which includes the propositions of calculus and function spaces on hypergraphs. Several results related to the maximum principle on hypergraphs have also been proven. As applications, we demonstrated how these can be used to study partial differential equations on hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Fractional regularity, global persistence, and asymptotic properties of the Boussinesq equations on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the long-time behavior of the 2D Boussinesq system, which consists of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations driven by a non-diffusive density. We construct globally persistent solutions on a smooth bounded domain, when the initial data belongs to $(H^k\cap V)\times H^k$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and $H^s\times H^s$ for $0&lt;s&lt;2$. The proofs use parabolic maximal regularity and specific compatibility conditions at the initial time. Additionally, we also deduce various asymptotic properties of the velocity and density in the long-time limit and present a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence to a steady state.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations towards Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the solutions $\rho_\varepsilon, \mathbf{u}_\varepsilon$ to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in a domain periodically perforated by holes of diameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We focus on the case where the diameter of the holes is of the same order as the distance between neighboring holes. This is the same setting investigated in the paper by Masmoudi [\url{http://www.numdam.org/article/COCV_2002__8__885_0.pdf}], where convergence $\rho_\varepsilon, \mathbf{u}_\varepsilon$ of the system to the porous medium equation has been shown. We prove a quantitative version of this convergence result provided that the solution of the limiting system is sufficiently regular. The proof builds on the relative energy inequality satisfied by the compressible NSE.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and characterisation of local minimisers in higher order Calculus of Variations in $\mathrm L^{\infty}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study variational problems for second order supremal functionals $\mathrm F_\infty(u)= \|F(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm{A}\!:\!\mathrm D^2u)\|_{\mathrm L^{\infty}(\Omega)}$, where $F$ satisfies certain natural assumptions, $\mathrm A$ is a positive matrix, and $\Omega \Subset \mathbb R^n$. Higher order problems are very novel in the Calculus of Variations in $\mathrm L^{\infty}$, and exhibit a strikingly different behaviour compared to first order problems, for which there exists an established theory, pioneered by Aronsson in 1960s. The aim of this paper is to develop a complete theory for $\mathrm F_\infty$. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, ``localised" minimisers can be characterised as solutions to a nonlinear system of PDEs, which is different from the corresponding Aronsson equation for $\mathrm F_\infty$; the latter is only a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for minimality. We also establish the existence and uniqueness of localised minimisers subject to Dirichlet conditions on $\partial \Omega$, and also their partial regularity outside a singular set of codimension one, which may be non-empty even if $n=1$.</description>

      <title>Hardy inequalities for large fermionic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $0&lt;s&lt;\frac d2$ with $s\leq 1$, we are interested in the large $N$-behavior of the optimal constant $\kappa_N$ in the Hardy inequality $\sum_{n=1}^N (-\Delta_n)^s \geq \kappa_N \sum_{n&lt;m} |X_n-X_m|^{-2s}$, when restricted to antisymmetric functions. We show that $N^{1-\frac{2s}d}\kappa_N$ has a positive, finite limit given by a certain variational problem, thereby generalizing a result of Lieb and Yau related to the Chandrasekhar theory of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the stochastic thin-film equation with an interface potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider strictly positive solutions to a class of fourth-order conservative quasilinear SPDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus modeled after the stochastic thin-film equation. Using recent results on quasilinear stochastic evolution equations, we show local well-posedness, blow-up criteria and instantaneous regularization in suitable function spaces under corresponding smoothness conditions on the noise. As a key ingredient, we prove stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimates for thin film-type operators with measurable in time coefficients. With the aid of the above-mentioned results, we obtain global well-posedness of the stochastic thin-film equation with an interface potential by closing $\alpha$-entropy estimates and subsequently an energy estimate in dimension one. In particular, we can treat a wide range of mobility functions including the power laws $u^n$ for $n\in [0,6)$ as long as the interface potential is sufficiently repulsive.</description>

      <title>Generic non-uniqueness of minimizing harmonic maps from a ball to a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study non-uniqueness for minimizing harmonic maps from $B^3$ to $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show that every boundary map can be modified to a boundary map that admits multiple minimizers of the Dirichlet energy by a small $W^{1,p}$-change for $p&lt;2$. This strengthens a remark by the second-named author and Strzelecki. The main novel ingredient is a homotopy construction, which is the answer to an easier variant of a challenging question regarding the existence of a norm control for homotopies between $ W^{1,p} $ maps.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimate of electromagnetic field concentration between two nearly-touching inclusions in the quasi-static regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic field concentration between two nearly-touching inclusions that possess high-contrast electric permittivities in the quasi-static regime. By using layer potential techniques and asymptotic analysis in the low-frequency regime, we derive low-frequency expansions that provide integral representations for the solutions of the Maxwell equations. For the leading-order term $\bE_0$ of the asymptotic expansion of the electric field, we prove that it has the blow up order of $\epsilon^{-1} |\ln \epsilon|^{-1}$ within the radial geometry, where $\epsilon$ signifies the asymptotic distance between the inclusions. By delicate analysis of the integral operators involved, we further prove the boundedness of the first-order term $\bE_1$. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments which not only corroborate the theoretical findings but also provide more discoveries on the field concentration in the general geometric setup. Our study provides the first treatment in the literature on field concentration between nearly-touching material inclusions for the full Maxwell system.</description>

      <title>Smooth helically symmetric transonic flows with nonzero vorticity in a concentric cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the structural stability of smooth cylindrical symmetric transonic flows in a concentric cylinder under helically symmetric perturbation of suitable boundary conditions. The deformation-curl decomposition developed by the second author and his collaborator is utilized to effectively decouple the elliptic-hyperbolic mixed structure in the steady compressible Euler equation. A key parameter in the helical symmetry is the step (denoted by $\sigma$), which denotes the magnitude of the translation along the symmetry axis after rotating one full turn. It is shown that the step determines the type of the first order partial differential system satisfied by the radial and vertical velocity. There exists a critical number $\sigma_{*}$ depending only on the background transonic flows, such that if $0&lt;\sigma&lt;\sigma_{*}$, one can prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth helically symmetric transonic flows with nonzero vorticity.</description>

      <title>Semilinear elliptic degenerate equations with critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are mainly concerned with nontrivial positive solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the degenerate elliptic equation
  \begin{gather}
  -\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} -\left|x\right|^{2k}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=|x|^{2k}u^p+f(x,y,u) \quad\text{ in }\Omega, \
u=0 \quad\text{ on }\partial\Omega,\label{equ0}
  \end{gather} where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary in $\mathbb{R}^2, \Omega \cap \{x=0\}\ne \emptyset,$ $k\in\mathbb N,$ $f(x,y,0)=0,$ and $p=(4+5k)/k$ is the critical exponent. Recently, the equation (1) was investigated in [12] for the subcritical case based on a new result obtained in [17] on embedding theorem of weighted Sobolev spaces. In the critical case considered in this paper we will essentially use the optimal functions and constants found in [17]</description>

      <title>Kinetic-type Mean Field Games with Non-separable Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness of a class of kinetic-type Mean Field Games, which typically arise when agents control their acceleration. Such systems include independent variables representing the spatial position as well as velocity. We consider non-separable Hamiltonians without any structural conditions, which depend locally on the density variable. Our analysis is based on two main ingredients: an energy method for the forward-backward system in Sobolev spaces, on the one hand and on a suitable vector field method to control derivatives with respect to the velocity variable, on the other hand. The careful combination of these two techniques reveals interesting phenomena applicable for Mean Field Games involving general classes of drift-diffusion operators and nonlinearities. While many prior existence theories for general Mean Field Games systems take the final datum function to be smoothing, we can allow this function to be non-smoothing, i.e. also depending locally on the final measure. Our well-posedness results hold under an appropriate smallness condition, assumed jointly on the data.</description>

      <title>An inhomogeneous porous medium equation with non-integrable data: asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior as $t\to+\infty$ of solutions to a weighted porous medium equation in $ \mathbb{R}^N $, whose weight $\rho(x)$ behaves at spatial infinity like $ |x|^{-\gamma} $ with subcritical power, namely $ \gamma \in [0,2) $. Inspired by some results by Alikakos-Rostamian and Kamin-Ughi from the 1980s on the unweighted problem, we focus on solutions whose initial data $u_0(x)$ are not globally integrable with respect to the weight and behave at infinity like $ |x|^{-\alpha} $, for $\alpha\in(0,N-\gamma)$. In the special case $ \rho(x)=|x|^{-\gamma} $ and $ u_0(x)=|x|^{-\alpha} $ we show that self-similar solutions of Barenblatt type, i.e. reminiscent of the usual source-type solutions, still exist, although they are no longer compactly supported. Moreover, they exhibit a transition phenomenon which is new even for the unweighted equation. We prove that such self-similar solutions are attractors for the original problem, and convergence takes place globally in suitable weighted $ L^p $ spaces for $p\in[1,\infty)$ and even globally in $L^\infty$ under some mild additional regularity assumptions on the weight. Among the fundamental tools that we exploit, it is worth mentioning a global smoothing effect for non-integrable data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the long-time behavior of solutions (and their derivatives) to the micropolar equations with nonlinear velocity damping. Additionally, we get a speed-up gain of $ t^{1/2} $ for the angular velocity, consistent with established findings for classic micropolar flows lacking nonlinear damping. Consequently, we also obtain a sharper result regarding the asymptotic stability of the micro-rotational velocity $\ww(\cdot,t)$. Related results of independent interest are also included.</description>

      <title>Boundary Layer Estimates in Stochastic Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove quantitative decay estimates for the boundary layer corrector in stochastic homogenization in the case of a half-space boundary. Our estimates are of optimal order and show that the gradient of the boundary layer corrector features nearly fluctuation-order decay; its expected value decays even one order faster. As a corollary, we deduce estimates on the accuracy of the representative volume element method for the computation of effective coefficients: our understanding of the decay of boundary layers enables us to improve the order of convergence of the RVE method for $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic spreading of predator-prey populations in a shifting environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies associating shifting temperature conditions with changes in the efficiency of predator species in converting their prey to offspring, we propose a predator-prey model of reaction-diffusion type to analyze the consequence of such effects on the population dynamics and spread of species. In the model, the predator conversion efficiency is represented by a spatially heterogeneous function depending on the variable $\xi=x-c_1t$ for some given $c_1&gt;0$. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach, we provide explicit formulas for the spreading speed of the predator species. When the conversion function is monotone increasing, the spreading speed is determined in all cases and non-local pulling is possible. When the function is monotone decreasing, we provide formulas for the spreading speed when the rate of shift of the conversion function is sufficiently fast or slow.</description>

Abstract: We study non-local or fractional capacities in metric measure spaces. Our main goal is to clarify the relations between relative Hajlasz-Triebel-Lizorkin capacities, potentional Triebel-Lizorkin capacities, and metric space variants of Riesz capacities. As an application of our results, we obtain a characterization of a Hajlasz-Triebel-Lizorkin capacity density condition, which is based on an earlier characterization of a Riesz capacity density condition in terms of Hausdorff contents.</description>

Abstract: The approach presented in the second installment of this series is extended to multidimensional systems of conservation laws that are approximated via a Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured (triangular) grids. Special attention is paid to predicting the entropy dissipation from boundaries. The resulting schemes are free of tunable viscosity parameters and tested on the Euler equations. The trinity of testcases is the spreading of thermal energy from a point source, transsonic and supersonic flows around airfoils, and supersonic air inlets.</description>

      <title>To blow-up or not to blow-up for a granular kinetic equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simplified kinetic description of rapid granular media leads to a nonlocal Vlasov-type equation with a convolution integral operator that is of the same form as the continuity equations for aggregation-diffusion macroscopic dynamics. While the singular behavior of these nonlinear continuity equations is well studied in the literature, the extension to the corresponding granular kinetic equation is highly nontrivial. The main question is whether the singularity formed in velocity direction will be enhanced or mitigated by the shear in phase space due to free transport. We present a preliminary study through a meticulous numerical investigation and heuristic arguments. We have numerically developed a structure-preserving method with adaptive mesh refinement that can effectively capture potential blow-up behavior in the solution for granular kinetic equations. We have analytically constructed a finite-time blow-up infinite mass solution and discussed how this can provide insights into the finite mass scenario.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we derive a blow-up result for a semilinear generalized Tricomi equation with damping and mass terms having time-dependent coefficients. We consider these coefficients with critical decay rates. Due to this threshold nature of the time-dependent coefficients (both for the damping and for the mass), the multiplicative constants appearing in these lower-order terms strongly influence the value of the critical exponent, determining a competition between a Fujita-type exponent and a Strauss-type exponent.</description>

      <title>Exponential ergodicity of a degenerate age-size piecewise deterministic process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of the first-moment semigroup of a non conservative piecewise deterministic measure-valued stochastic process with support on R 2 + driven by a deterministic flow between random jump times, with a transition kernel which has a degenerate form. Using a Doob h-transform where the function h is taken as an eigenfunction of the associated generator, we can bring ourselves back to the study of a conservative process whose exponential ergodicity is proven via Harris' Theorem. Particular attention is given to the proof of Doeblin minoration condition. The main difficulty is the degeneracy of one of the two variables, and the deterministic dependency between the two variables, which make it no trivial to uniformly bound the expected value of the trajectories with respect to a non-degenerate measure in a two-dimensional space, which is particularly hard in a non-compact setting. Here, we propose a general method to construct explicit trajectories which explore the space state with positive probability and witch permit to prove a petite-set condition for the compact sets of the state space. An application to an age-structured growthfragmentation process modelling bacterial growth is also shown.</description>

      <title>Stability Results for Novel Serially-connected Magnetizable Piezoelectric and Elastic Smart-System Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the stability of longitudinal vibrations for transmission problems of two smart-system designs are studied: (i) a serially-connected Elastic-Piezoelectric-Elastic design with a local damping acting only on the piezoelectric layer and (ii) a serially-connected Piezoelectric-Elastic design with a local damping acting on the elastic part only. Unlike the existing literature, piezoelectric layers are considered magnetizable, and therefore, a fully-dynamic PDE model, retaining interactions of electromagnetic fields (due to Maxwell's equations) with the mechanical vibrations, is considered. The design (i) is shown to have exponentially stable solutions. However, the nature of the stability of solutions of the design (ii), whether it is polynomial or exponential, is dependent entirely upon the arithmetic nature of a quotient involving all physical parameters. Furthermore, a polynomial decay rate is provided in terms of a measure of irrationality of the quotient. Note that this type of result is totally new (see Theorem 3.6 and Condition $\rm{\mathbf{(H_{Pol})}}$). The main tool used throughout the paper is the multipliers technique which requires an adaptive selection of cut-off functions together with a particular attention to the sharpness of the estimates to optimize the results.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation for all type of potentials, in both the torus $\mathbf{T}^3$ and in the whole space $\mathbf{R}^3$, under the incompressible Navier-Stokes scaling. We first establish the well-posedness and decay of global mild solutions to this rescaled Boltzmann equation in a perturbative framework, that is for solutions close to the Maxwellian, obtaining in particular integrated-in-time regularization estimates. We then combine these estimates with spectral-type estimates in order to obtain the strong convergence of solutions to the non-cutoff Boltzmannn equation towards the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system.</description>

Abstract: Considered herein is a particular nonlinear dispersive stochastic system consisting of Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations. They are coupled by nonlinear terms due to the Yukawa interaction. We consider a case of homogeneous multiplicative noise that seems to be very natural from the perspective of the least action formalism. We are able to show existence and uniqueness of a corresponding Cauchy problem in Bourgain spaces. Moreover, the regarded model implies charge conservation, known for the deterministic analogue of the system, and this is used to prove a global existence result for suitable initial data.</description>

Abstract: The boundary stabilization problem of the Boussinesq KdV-KdV type system is investigated in this paper. An appropriate boundary feedback law consisting of a linear combination of a damping mechanism and a delay term is designed. Then, first, considering time-varying delay feedback together with a smallness restriction on the length of the spatial domain and the initial data, we show that the problem under consideration is well-posed. The proof combines Kato's approach and the fixed-point argument. Last but not least, we prove that the energy of the linearized KdV-KdV system decays exponentially by employing the Lyapunov method.</description>

Abstract: This is an expository article that describes the spectral-theoretic aspects in the study of the stability of self-similar blowup for nonlinear wave equations. The linearization near a self-similar solution leads to a genuinely nonself-adjoint operator which is difficult to analyze. The main goal of this article is to provide an accessible account to the only known method that is capable of providing sufficient spectral information to complete the stability analysis. The exposition is based on a mini course given at the Summer School on Geometric Dispersive PDEs in Obergurgl, Austria, in September 2022.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a survey and a detailed numerical study on a remarkable Boussinesq system describing weakly nonlinear, long surface water waves. In the one-dimensional case, this system can be viewed as a dispersive perturbation of the hyperbolic Saint-Venant (shallow water) system. The asymptotic stability of the solitary waves is numerically established. Blow-up of solutions for initial data not satisfying the non-cavitation condition as well as the appearence of dispersive shock waves are studied.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second of a series devoted to the study of the dynamics of the spectrum of large random matrices. We study general extensions of the partial differential equation arising to characterize the limit spectral measure of the Dyson Brownian motion. We provide a regularizing result for those generalizations. We also show that several results of part I extend to cases in which there is no spectral dominance property. We then provide several modeling extensions of such models as well as several identities for the Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>On the quadratic convergence of Newton's method for Mean Field Games with non-separable Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze asymptotic convergence properties of Newton's method for a class of evolutive Mean Field Games systems with non-separable Hamiltonian arising in mean field type models with congestion. We prove the well posedness of the Mean Field Game system with non-separable Hamiltonian and of the linear system giving the Newton iterations. Then, by forward induction and assuming that the initial guess is sufficiently close to the solution of problem, we show a quadratic rate of convergence for the approximation of the Mean Field Game system by Newton's method. We also consider the case of a nonlocal coupling, but with separable Hamiltonian, and we show a similar rate of convergence.</description>

      <title>Classical-Quantum correspondence in Lindblad evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as in two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>
