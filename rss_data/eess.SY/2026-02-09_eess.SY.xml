      <title>Dynamic Quantum Optimal Communication Topology Design for Consensus Control in Linear Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum framework for the design of communication topologies in consensus-based multi-agent systems. The communication graph is selected online by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that minimizes a cost combining communication and distance penalties with degree-regularization terms, while enforcing exact connectivity through a flow-based formulation. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of this NP-hard problem, we develop a three-block ADMM scheme that decomposes the MIQP into a convex quadratic program in relaxed edge and flow variables, a pure binary unconstrained subproblem, and a closed-form auxiliary update. The binary subproblem is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonian and approximately solved via quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE). The resulting time-varying, optimizer-generated Laplacians are applied to linear first- and second-order consensus dynamics. Numerical simulations on networks demonstrate that the proposed method produces connected topologies that satisfy degree constraints, achieve consensus, and incur costs comparable to those of classical mixed-integer solvers, thereby illustrating how quantum algorithms can be embedded as topology optimizers within closed-loop distributed control architectures.</description>

      <title>A hard-constrained NN learning framework for rapidly restoring AC-OPF from DC-OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hard-constrained unsupervised learning framework for rapidly solving the non-linear and non-convex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem in real-time operation. Without requiring ground-truth AC-OPF solutions, feasibility and optimality are ensured through a properly designed learning environment and training loss. Inspired by residual learning, the neural network (NN) learns the correction mapping from the DC-OPF solution to the active power setpoints of the generators through re-dispatch. A subsequent optimization model is utilized to restore the optimal AC-OPF solution, and the resulting projection difference is employed as the training loss. A replay buffer is utilized to enhance learning efficiency by fully leveraging past data pairs. The optimization model is cast as a differentiable optimization layer, where the gradient is derived by applying the implicit function theorem to the KKT conditions at the optimal solution. Tested on IEEE-118 and PEGASE-9241 bus systems, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NN can obtain strictly feasible and near-optimal solutions with reduced computational time compared to conventional optimization solvers. In addition, aided by the updated DC-OPF solution under varying topologies, the trained NN, together with the PF solver, can rapidly find the corresponding AC solution. The proposed method achieves a $40\times$ time speedup, while maintaining an average constraint violation on the order of $10^{-4}$ and an optimization gap below $1\%$.</description>

      <title>Advances in Battery Energy Storage Management: Control and Economic Synergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing literature on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) predominantly focuses on two main areas: control system design aimed at achieving grid stability and the techno-economic analysis of BESS dispatch on power grid. However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential.
  The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization. This review will identify potential synergies, research gaps, and emerging trends, paving the way for future innovations in BESS management and deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>Safety Controller Synthesis for Stochastic Polynomial Time-Delayed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a theoretical framework for safety controller synthesis in discrete-time stochastic nonlinear polynomial systems subject to time-invariant delays (dt-SNPS-td). While safety analysis of stochastic systems using control barrier certificates (CBC) has been widely studied, developing safety controllers for stochastic systems with time delays remains largely unexplored. The main challenge arises from the need to account for the influence of delayed components when formulating and enforcing safety conditions. To address this, we employ Krasovskii control barrier certificates, which extend the conventional CBC framework by augmenting it with an additional summation term that captures the influence of delayed states. This formulation integrates both the current and delayed components into a unified barrier structure, enabling safety synthesis for stochastic systems with time delays. The proposed approach synthesizes safety controllers under input constraints, offering probabilistic safety guarantees robust to such delays: it ensures that all trajectories of the dt-SNPS-td remain within the prescribed safe region while fulfilling a quantified probabilistic bound. To achieve this, our method reformulates the safety constraints as a sum-of-squares optimization program, enabling the systematic construction of Krasovskii CBC together with their associated safety controllers. We validate the proposed framework through three case studies, including two physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Structured Learning for Electromagnetic Field Modeling and Real-Time Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise magnetic field modeling is fundamental to the closed-loop control of electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) and the analytical Multipole Expansion Model (MPEM) is the current standard. However, the MPEM relies on strict physical assumptions regarding source symmetry and isolation, and requires optimization-based calibration that is highly sensitive to initialization. These constraints limit its applicability to systems with complex or irregular coil geometries. This work introduces an alternative modeling paradigm based on multi-layer perceptrons that learns nonlinear magnetic mappings while strictly preserving the linear dependence on currents. As a result, the field models enable fast, closed-form minimum-norm inversion with evaluation times of approximately 1 ms, which is critical for high-bandwidth magnetic control. For model training and evaluation we use large-scale, high-density datasets collected from the research-grade OctoMag and clinical-grade Navion systems. Our results demonstrate that data-driven models achieve predictive fidelity equivalent to the MPEM while maintaining comparable data efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that straightforward design choices effectively eliminate spurious workspace ill-conditioning frequently reported in MPEM-based calibration. To facilitate future research, we release the complete codebase and datasets open source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of efficient and robust dynamic models is fundamental in the field of systems and control engineering. In this paper, a new formulation for the dynamic model of nonlinear mechanical systems, that can be applied to different automotive and robotic case studies, is proposed, together with a modeling procedure allowing to automatically obtain the model formulation. Compared with the Euler-Lagrange formulation, the proposed model is shown to give superior performances in terms of robustness against measurement noise for systems exhibiting dependence on some external variables, as well as in terms of execution time when computing the inverse dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>UnifSrv: AP Selection for Achieving Uniformly Good Performance of CF-MIMO in Realistic Urban Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the ideal assumption of uniform propagation, cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides uniformly high throughput over the network by effectively surrounding each user with its serving access point (AP) set. However, in realistic non-uniform urban propagation environments, it is difficult to consistently select good limited serving AP sets, resulting in significantly degraded throughput, reintroducing "edge-effect" for the worst-served users. To restore the uniformly good performance of scalable CF-mMIMO in realistic urban networks, we formulate a novel multi-objective optimization problem to jointly achieve high throughput by maximizing the sum data rate, uniform throughput by maximizing Jain's fairness index of the throughput per user, and scalability by minimizing the serving AP set size. We then propose the UnifSrv AP selection algorithms to solve this optimization problem, consisting of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm UnifSrv-DRL and a heuristic algorithm UnifSrv-heu. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of scalable CF-mMIMO under realistic urban network distributions, propagation, and mobility patterns, showing that the prior benchmark AP selection schemes fail to provide uniformly high throughput in practice. By contrast, UnifSrv at least doubles the throughput compared to prior benchmarks, or achieves comparable throughput but with half of the serving AP set size. Importantly, our heuristic algorithm achieves equivalent throughput to our DRL one, but with orders of magnitude lower complexity. We thus for the first time propose an AP selection algorithm that achieves uniformly good CF-mMIMO performance in realistic urban networks with low complexity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Derivative Feedback Control for an Active Magnetic Levitation System: An Experimental Study on Data-Driven Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of data-driven optimal derivative feedback controllers for an active magnetic levitation system. A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Motion/Force Control of Mobile Manipulators via Extended-UDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00443v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators are known for their superior mobility over manipulators on fixed bases, offering promising applications in smart industry and housekeeping scenarios. The dynamic coupling nature between the mobile base and the manipulator presents challenges for force interactive tasks of the mobile manipulator. However, current strategies often fail to account for this coupling in such scenarios. To address this, this paper presents a dynamic coupling-integrated manipulator model that requires only the manipulator dynamics and the mobile base kinematics, which simplifies the modeling process. In addition, embedding the dynamic model, an extended uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) is proposed for the mobile manipulator, which separately estimates the dynamic coupling terms and other unmodeled uncertainties, incorporating them into the feedforward and feedback control loops, respectively. The proposed approach increases the speed of response of the system and improves the dynamic robot-environment interaction (REI) performance of the mobile manipulator. A series of simulations and experiments of a wall-cleaning task are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the motion/force tracking performance when the mobile base is in dynamic motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized collaborative mean estimation (colME) is a fundamental task in heterogeneous networks. Its graph-based variants B-colME and C-colME achieve high scalability of the problem. This paper evaluates the consensus-based C-colME framework, which relies on doubly stochastic averaging matrices to ensure convergence to the oracle solution. We propose CL-colME, a novel variant utilizing Laplacian-based consensus to avoid the computationally expensive normalization processes. Simulation results show that the proposed CL-colME maintains the convergence behavior and accuracy of C-colME while improving computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling, Parameter Identification and Numerical Analysis of Flexible Cables in Flexibly Connected Dual-AUV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a dynamic modeling framework and parameter identification methods for describing the highly nonlinear behaviors of flexibly connected dual-AUV systems. The modeling framework is established based on the lumped mass method, integrating axial elasticity, bending stiffness, added mass and hydrodynamic forces, thereby accurately capturing the time-varying response of the forces and cable configurations. To address the difficulty of directly measuring material-related and hydrodynamic coefficients, this research proposes a parameter identification method that combines the physical model with experimental data. High-precision inversion of the equivalent Youngs modulus and hydrodynamic coefficients is performed through tension experiments under multiple configurations, effectively demonstrating that the identified model maintains predictive consistency in various operational conditions. Further numerical analysis indicates that the dynamic properties of flexible cable exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which are highly dependent on material property variations and AUV motion conditions. This nonlinear dynamic behavior results in two typical response states, slack and taut, which are jointly determined by boundary conditions and hydrodynamic effects, significantly affecting the cable configuration and endpoint loads. In this research, the dynamics of flexible cables under complex boundary conditions is revealed, providing a theoretical foundation for the design, optimization and further control research of similar systems.</description>

      <title>Active Localization of Unstable Systems with Coarse Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization and control for unstable systems under coarse, single-bit sensing. Motivated by understanding the fundamental limitations imposed by such minimal feedback, we identify sufficient conditions under which the initial state can be recovered despite instability and extremely sparse measurements. Building on these conditions, we develop an active localization algorithm that integrates a set-based estimator with a control strategy derived from Voronoi partitions, which provably estimates the initial state while ensuring the agent remains in informative regions. Under the derived conditions, the proposed approach guarantees exponential contraction of the initial-state uncertainty, and the result is further supported by numerical experiments. These findings can offer theoretical insight into localization in robotics, where sensing is often limited to coarse abstractions such as keyframes, segmentations, or line-based features.</description>

      <title>Chasing Tails: How Do People Respond to Wait Time Distributions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a series of pre-registered, incentive-compatible online experiments to investigate how people evaluate and choose among different waiting time distributions. Our main findings are threefold. First, consistent with prior literature, people show an aversion to both longer expected waits and higher variance. Second, and more surprisingly, moment-based utility models fail to capture preferences when distributions have thick-right tails: indeed, decision-makers strongly prefer distributions with long-right tails (where probability mass is more evenly distributed over a larger support set) relative to tails that exhibit a spike near the maximum possible value, even when controlling for mean, variance, and higher moments. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) utility models commonly used in portfolio theory predict these choices well. Third, when given a choice, decision-makers overwhelmingly seek information about right-tail outcomes. These results have practical implications for service operations: (1) service designs that create a spike in long waiting times (such as priority or dedicated queue designs) may be particularly aversive; (2) when informativeness is the goal, providers should prioritize sharing right-tail probabilities or percentiles; and (3) to increase service uptake, providers can strategically disclose (or withhold) distributional information depending on right-tail shape.</description>

      <title>Nipping the Drift in the Bud: Retrospective Rectification for Robust Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires embodied agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through complex continuous 3D environments. However, the dominant imitation learning paradigm suffers from exposure bias, where minor deviations during inference lead to compounding errors. While DAgger-style approaches attempt to mitigate this by correcting error states, we identify a critical limitation: Instruction-State Misalignment. Forcing an agent to learn recovery actions from off-track states often creates supervision signals that semantically conflict with the original instruction. In response to these challenges, we introduce BudVLN, an online framework that learns from on-policy rollouts by constructing supervision to match the current state distribution. BudVLN performs retrospective rectification via counterfactual re-anchoring and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis, using a geodesic oracle to synthesize corrective trajectories that originate from valid historical states, ensuring semantic consistency. Experiments on the standard R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate that BudVLN consistently mitigates distribution shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Success Rate and SPL.</description>

      <title>A Consistency-Improved LiDAR-Inertial Bundle Adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D LiDAR has emerged as a cornerstone for autonomous navigation in robotics. While feature-based SLAM systems have achieved impressive results by leveraging edge and planar structures, they often suffer from the inconsistent estimator associated with feature parameterization and estimated covariance. In this work, we present a consistency-improved LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) with tailored parameterization and estimator. First, we propose a stereographic-projection representation parameterizing the planar and edge features, and conduct a comprehensive observability analysis to support its integrability with consistent estimator. Second, we implement a LiDAR-inertial BA with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) formulation and First-Estimate Jacobians (FEJ) to preserve the accurate estimated covariance and observability properties of the system. Last, we apply our proposed BA method to a LiDAR-inertial odometry.</description>

      <title>Force Generative Imitation Learning: Bridging Position Trajectory and Force Commands through Control Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contact-rich tasks, while position trajectories are often easy to obtain, appropriate force commands are typically unknown. Although it is conceivable to generate force commands using a pretrained foundation model such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, force control is highly dependent on the specific hardware of the robot, which makes the application of such models challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from given position trajectories. However, when dealing with unseen position trajectories, the model struggles to generate accurate force commands. To address this, we introduce a feedback control mechanism. Our experiments reveal that feedback control does not converge when the force generative model has memory. We therefore adopt a model without memory, enabling stable feedback control. This approach allows the system to generate force commands effectively, even for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization for real-world robot writing tasks.</description>

      <title>DUST: A Framework for Data-Driven Density Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of data-driven stochastic optimal control of an unknown LTI dynamical system. Assuming the process noise is normally distributed, we pose the problem of steering the state's mean and covariance to a target normal distribution, under noisy data collected from the underlying system, a problem commonly referred to as covariance steering (CS). A novel framework for Data-driven Uncertainty quantification and density STeering (DUST) is presented that simultaneously characterizes the noise affecting the measured data and designs an optimal affine-feedback controller to steer the density of the state to a prescribed terminal value. We use both indirect and direct data-driven design approaches based on the notions of persistency of excitation and subspace identification to exactly represent the mean and covariance dynamics of the state in terms of the data and noise realizations. Since both the mean and the covariance steering sub-problems are plagued with stochastic uncertainty arising from noisy data collection, we first estimate the noise realization from this dataset and subsequently compute tractable upper bounds on the estimation errors. The first and second moment steering problems are then solved to optimality using techniques from robust control and robust optimization. Lastly, we present an alternative control design approach based on the certainty equivalence principle and interpret the problem as one of CS under multiplicative uncertainty. We analyze the performance and efficacy of each of these data-driven approaches using a case study and compare them with their model-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Exposing Barriers to Flexibility Aggregation in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DER) offers new opportunities for distribution system operators (DSO) to improve network operation through flexibility services. To utilise flexible resources, various DER flexibility aggregation methods have been proposed, such as the concept of aggregated P-Q flexibility areas. Yet, many existing studies assume perfect coordination among DER and rely on single-phase power flow analysis, thus overlooking barriers to flexibility aggregation in real unbalanced systems. To quantify the impact of these barriers, this paper proposes a three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) framework for P-Q flexibility assessment, implemented as an open-source Julia tool 3FlexAnalyser.jl. The framework explicitly accounts for voltage unbalance and imperfect coordination among DER in low voltage (LV) distribution networks. Simulations on an illustrative 5-bus system and a real 221-bus LV network in the UK reveal that over 30% of the theoretical aggregated flexibility potential can be lost due to phase unbalance and lack of coordination across phases. These findings highlight the need for improved flexibility aggregation tools applicable to real unbalanced distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Set-Based Control Barrier Functions for Scalable Safety Filter Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial control applications require high performance under strict constraints. Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide principled safety mechanisms, but constructing CBF-based safety filters for large-scale systems is challenging. We introduce set-based CBFs for linear systems with convex constraints by defining the barrier via the Minkowski functional of a control invariant set. This invariant set can be obtained from scalable computations, including reachability analysis and model predictive control (MPC). The approach yields tunable safety filters with dampened intervention and asymptotic stability of the set of safe states. We derive reformulations embedding set-based CBF constraints into convex optimization for common set representations and present learning-based approximations reducing runtime while preserving safety. We demonstrate the approach through simulations on a high-dimensional system and a motion control task, and validate the method experimentally on an electric drive with short sampling times.</description>

      <title>Reservoir Predictive Path Integral Control for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have found extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems, yet fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain central challenges. To meet these challenges, this paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs)--reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks--and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control--sampling-based variants of model predictive control. The proposed reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics with ESNs and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in MPPI control computation without linearization approximations. This framework is further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which achieves robust stochastic control by treating ESN output weights as random variables and minimizing an expected cost over their distribution to account for identification errors. Experiments on controlling a Duffing oscillator and a four-tank system demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based model predictive control methods.</description>

      <title>Detection and Identification of Sensor Attacks Using Partially Attack-Free Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate data-driven attack detection and identification in a model-free setting. We consider a practically motivated scenario in which the available dataset may be compromised by malicious sensor attacks, but contains an unknown, contiguous, partially attack-free interval. The control input is assumed to include a small stochastic watermarking signal. Under these assumptions, we establish sufficient conditions for attack detection and identification from partially attack-free data. We also develop data-driven detection and identification procedures and characterize their computational complexity. Notably, the proposed framework does not impose a limit on the number of compromised sensors; thus, it can detect and identify attacks even when all sensor outputs are compromised outside the attack-free interval, provided that the attack-free interval is sufficiently long. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-satellite links for 6G networks face critical challenges, including severe path loss, tight size-weight-power limits, and congested spectrum, all of which significantly hinder the performance of traditional radio frequency (RF) front ends. This article introduces the Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receiver (RAQR) for onboard satellite systems, a millimeter-scale front end that converts radio fields to optical signals through atomic electromagnetically induced transparency. RAQR's high sensitivity and high frequency selectivity address link budget, payload, and interference challenges while fitting within space constraints. A hybrid atomic-electronic design and supporting signal model demonstrate enhanced data rate, coverage, and sensing accuracy relative to conventional RF receivers. The article concludes with integration strategies, distributed-satellite concepts, and open research problems for bringing RAQR-enabled satellite payloads into service.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Electricity and Water in Renewable-Colocated Desalination Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the optimal scheduling of flexible water desalination plants (WDPs) as hybrid generator-load resources. WDPs integrate thermal generation, membrane-based controllable loads, and renewable energy sources, offering unique operational flexibility for power system operations. They can simultaneously participate in two markets: selling desalinated water to a water utility, and bidirectionally transacting electricity with the grid based on their net electricity demand. We formulate the scheduling decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis Datasets of Three-phase Asynchronous Motor Under Variable Working Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-phase asynchronous motor are fundamental components in industrial systems, and their failure can lead to significant operational downtime and economic losses. Vibration and current signals are effective indicators for monitoring motor health and diagnosing faults. However, motors in real applications often operate under variable conditions such as fluctuating speeds and loads, which complicate the fault diagnosis process. This paper presents a comprehensive dataset collected from a three-phase asynchronous motor under various fault types and severities, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. The dataset includes both single faults and mechanical-electrical compound faults, such as rotor unbalance, stator winding short circuits, bearing faults, and their combinations. Data were acquired under both steady and transitional conditions, with signals including triaxial vibration, three-phase currents, torque, and key-phase signals. This dataset supports the development and validation of robust fault diagnosis methods for electric motors under realistic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Formalization of Self-Determining Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining agency is an extremely important challenge for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between these and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism remains an ongoing debate. Although we have already proposed a physical agent determinism model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, an index sequence that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans.</description>

      <title>ProOPF: Benchmarking and Improving LLMs for Professional-Grade Power Systems Optimization Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06662v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.</description>

      <title>From a Frequency-Domain Willems' Lemma to Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma has recently received an impressive amount of attention from the data-driven control community. In this paper, we formulate a version of this celebrated result based on frequency-domain data. In doing so, we bridge the gap between recent developments in data-driven control, and the readily-available techniques and expertise for non-parametric frequency-domain identification. We also generalize our results to combine multiple frequency-domain data sets to form a sufficiently rich data set. Building on these results, we propose a data-driven predictive control scheme based on measured frequency-domain data of the plant. This novel scheme provides a frequency-domain counterpart of the well-known data-enabled predictive control scheme DeePC based on time-domain data. Under appropriate conditions, the new frequency-domain data-driven predictive control (FreePC) scheme is equivalent to the corresponding DeePC scheme. We demonstrate the benefits of FreePC and the use of frequency-domain data in several examples and a numerical case study, including the ability to collect data in closed loop, computational benefits, and intuitive visualization of the data.</description>

      <title>REACT: Real-time Entanglement-Aware Coverage Path Planning for Tethered Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspection of underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT (real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a computationally efficient geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we achieve safe and entanglement-free inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe inspection scenario, demonstrating safe navigation and full coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission 20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical tether entanglement.</description>

      <title>Pascal-Weighted Genetic Algorithms: A Binomially-Structured Recombination Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations.
  We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.</description>

      <title>Experimental Sensitivity Enhancement of a Quantum Rydberg Atom-Based RF Receiver with a Metamaterial GRIN Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and improves the microwave electric field measurement sensitivity of the Rydberg atom-based RF receiver over an ultrawide bandwidth of the lens. This experimental validation demonstrates the potential of metamaterial-enhanced quantum RF sensing for a wide range of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Regret of $H_\infty$ Preview Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies preview control in both the $H_\infty$ and regret-optimal settings. The plant is modeled as a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system subject to external disturbances. The performance baseline is the optimal non-causal controller that has full knowledge of the disturbance sequence. We first review the construction of the $H_\infty$ preview controller with $p$-steps of disturbance preview. We then show that the closed-loop $H_\infty$ performance of this preview controller converges as $p\to \infty$ to the performance of the optimal non-causal controller. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal regret of the preview controller converges to zero. These results demonstrate that increasing preview length allows controllers to asymptotically achieve non-causal performance in both the $H_\infty$ and regret frameworks. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical results.</description>
