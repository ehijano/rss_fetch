      <title>SHARP -- A near-IR multi-mode spectrograph conceived for MORFEO@ELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum-enhanced long-baseline optical/near-IR interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microarcsecond resolutions afforded by an optical-NIR array with kilometer-baselines would enable breakthrough science. However significant technology barriers exist in transporting weakly coherent photon states over these distances: primarily photon loss and phase errors. Quantum telescopy, using entangled states to link spatially separated apertures, offers a possible solution to the loss of photons. We report on an initiative launched by NSF NOIRLab in collaboration with the Center for Quantum Networks and Arizona Quantum Initiative at the University of Arizona, Tucson, to explore these concepts further. A brief description of the quantum concepts and a possible technology roadmap towards a quantum-enhanced very long baseline optical-NIR interferometric array is presented. An on-sky demonstration of measuring spatial coherence of photons with apertures linked through the simplest Gottesman protocol over short baselines and with limited phase fluctuations is envisaged as the first step.</description>

      <title>First laboratory and on-sky results of an adaptive secondary mirror with TNO-style actuators on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are developing an adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) that uses a new actuator technology created by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). The TNO hybrid variable reluctance actuators have more than an order of magnitude better efficiency over the traditional voice coil actuators that have been used on existing ASMs and show potential for improving the long-term robustness and reliability of ASMs. To demonstrate the performance, operations, and serviceability of TNO's actuators in an observatory, we have developed a 36-actuator prototype ASM for the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) called IRTF-ASM-1. IRTF-ASM-1 provides the first on-sky demonstration of this approach and will help us evaluate the long-term performance and use of this technology in an astronomical facility environment. We present calibration and performance results with the ASM in a Meniscus Hindle Sphere lens setup as well as preliminary on-sky results on IRTF. IRTF-ASM-1 achieved stable closed-loop performance on-sky with H-band Strehl ratios of 35-40% in long-exposure images under a variety of seeing conditions.</description>

      <title>In-field phasing at the upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06741v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In time-domain radio astronomy with arrays, voltages from individual antennas are added together with proper delay and fringe correction to form the beam in real-time. In order to achieve the correct phased addition of antenna voltages one has to also correct for the ionospheric and instrumental gains. Conventionally this is done using observations of a calibrator source located near to the target field. This scheme is sub-optimal since it does not correct for the variation of the gains with time and position in the sky. Further, since the ionospheric phase variation is typically most rapid at the longest baselines, the most distant antennas are often excluded while forming the beam. We present here a different methodology ("in-field phasing"), in which the gains are obtained in real-time using a model of the intensity distribution in the target field, which overcomes all of these drawbacks. We present observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) which demonstrates that in-field phasing does lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity. We also show, using observations of the millisecond pulsar J1120$-$3618 that this in turn leads to a significant improvement of measurements of the Dispersion Measure and Time of Arrival. Finally, we present test observations of the GMRT discovered eclipsing black widow pulsar J1544+4937 showing that in-field phasing leads to improvement in the measurement of the cut-off frequency of the eclipse.</description>

      <title>Generative models of astrophysical fields with scattering transforms on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering transforms are a new type of summary statistics recently developed for the study of highly non-Gaussian processes, which have been shown to be very promising for astrophysical studies. In particular, they allow one to build generative models of complex non-linear fields from a limited amount of data, and have also been used as the basis of new statistical component separation algorithms. In the context of upcoming cosmological surveys, such as LiteBIRD for the cosmic microwave background polarization or Rubin-LSST and Euclid for study of the large scale structures of the Universe, the extension of these tools to spherical data is necessary. We develop scattering transforms on the sphere and focus on the construction of maximum-entropy generative models of several astrophysical fields. We construct, from a single target field, generative models of homogeneous astrophysical and cosmological fields, whose samples are quantitatively compared to the target fields using common statistics (power spectrum, pixel probability density function and Minkowski functionals). Our sampled fields agree well with the target fields, both statistically and visually. These generative models therefore open up a wide range of new applications for future astrophysical and cosmological studies; particularly those for which very little simulated data is available. We make our code available to the community so that this work can be easily reproduced and developed further.</description>

      <title>Markov Walk Exploration of Model Spaces: Bayesian Selection of Dark Energy Models with Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to model selection is a trade-off between performing a good fit and low model complexity: A model of higher complexity should only be favoured over a simpler model if it provides significantly better fits. In Bayesian terms, this can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices between two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing Markovian random walks for exploring the entire model spaces governed by the logarithmic evidence ratio, in analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in parameter estimation problems. The theory of Markovian model exploration has an analytical description with partition functions, which we derive for both the canonical and macrocanonical case. We apply our methodology to selecting a polynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ fulfilling sensible physical priors, on the basis of data for the supernova distance-redshift relation. We conclude by commenting on the Jeffrey scale for Bayesian evidence ratios, choices of model priors and derived quantities like Shannon entropies for posterior model probabilities.</description>

      <title>DESI Early Data Release Milky Way Survey Value-Added Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the stellar value-added catalogue based on the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. The catalogue contains radial velocity and stellar parameter measurements for $\simeq$ 400,000 unique stars observed during commissioning and survey validation by DESI. These observations were made under conditions similar to the Milky Way Survey (MWS) currently carried out by DESI but also include multiple specially targeted fields, such as those containing well-studied dwarf galaxies and stellar streams. The majority of observed stars have $16&lt;r&lt;20$ with a median signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra of $\sim$ 20. In the paper, we describe the structure of the catalogue, give an overview of different target classes observed, as well as provide recipes for selecting clean stellar samples. We validate the catalogue using external high-resolution measurements and show that radial velocities, surface gravities, and iron abundances determined by DESI are accurate to 1 km/s, $0.3$ dex and $\sim$ 0.15 dex respectively. We also demonstrate possible uses of the catalogue for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way stellar halo and Draco dwarf spheroidal. The value-added catalogue described in this paper is the very first DESI MWS catalogue. The next DESI data release, expected in less than a year, will add the data from the first year of DESI survey operations and will contain approximately 4 million stars, along with significant processing improvements.</description>

      <title>Assessing Exoplanetary System Architectures with DYNAMITE Including Observational Upper Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information gathered from observing planetary systems is not limited to the discovery of planets, but also includes the observational upper limits constraining the presence of any additional planets. Incorporating these upper limits into statistical analyses of individual systems can significantly improve our ability to find hidden planets in these systems by narrowing the parameter space in which to search. Here I include radial velocity (RV), transit, and transit timing variation (TTV) upper limits on additional planets in known multi-planet systems into the DYNAMITE software package and test their impact on the predicted planets for these systems. The tests are run on systems with previous DYNAMITE analysis and with updated known planet parameters in the 2-3 years since the original predictions. I find that the RV limits provide the strongest constraints on additional planets, lowering the likelihood of finding them within orbital periods of ~10-100 days in the inner planetary systems, as well as truncating the likely planet size (radius and/or mass) distributions towards planets smaller than those currently observed. Transit and TTV limits also provide information on the size and inclination distributions of both the known and predicted planets in the system. Utilizing these limits on a wider range of systems in the near future will help determine which systems might be able to host temperate terrestrial planets and contribute to the search for extraterrestrial biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and Computational Studies of Interstellar Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice mantles play a crucial role in shaping the astrochemical inventory of molecules during star and planet formation. Small-scale molecular processes have a profound impact on large-scale astronomical evolution. The areas of solid-state laboratory astrophysics and computational chemistry study these processes. We review the laboratory effort on ice spectroscopy; methodological advances and challenges; and laboratory and computational studies of ice physics and ice chemistry. The latter we put in context with the ice evolution from clouds to disks. Three takeaway messages from this review are
  - Laboratory and computational studies allow interpretation of astronomical ice spectra in terms of identification, ice morphology and, local environmental conditions as well as the formation of the involved chemical compounds.
  - A detailed understanding of the underlying processes is needed to build reliable astrochemical models to make predictions on the abundances in space.
  - The relative importance of the different ice processes studied in the laboratory and computationally changes along the process of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>NEMESISPY: A Python package for simulating and retrieving exoplanetary spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NEMESISPY is a Python package developed to perform parametric atmospheric modelling and radiative transfer calculation for the retrievals of exoplanetary spectra. It is a recent development of the well-established Fortran NEMESIS library (P. G. J. Irwin et al., 2008), which has been applied to the atmospheric retrievals of both solar system planets and exoplanets employing numerous different observing geometries. NEMESISPY can be easily interfaced with Bayesian inference algorithms to retrieve atmospheric properties from spectroscopic observations. Recently, NEMESISPY has been applied to the retrievals of Hubble and Spitzer data of a hot Jupiter (Yang et al., 2023), as well as to JWST/Mid-Infrared Instrument (JWST/MIRI) data of a hot Jupiter (Yang et al., 2024).</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using machine-learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions, given spectro-photometric data. To this end, we build a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra) without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we are able to interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we use high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE, and GES), complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have parallaxes. We achieve median uncertainties (at $G\approx16$) of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeed in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone fitting methods we employed in earlier work, especially for the parameters $A_V$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity. Finally, we showcase some applications of this new catalogue (e.g. extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

      <title>Benefits of adding radial phase dimples on scalar coronagraph phase masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current scalar coronagraph focal plane mask designs are performance-limited by chromaticity. We investigate the effects of adding central Roddier and dual zone phase dimples to scalar vortex masks to improve broadband performance by suppressing the chromatic stellar leakage. We present hybrid designs with radial phase dimples integrated with the sawtooth vortex, wrapped vortex, and cosine phase mask. We show that using these dimples, it is possible to substantially improve the broadband contrast performance of scalar phase masks. We also show that although adding a phase dimple does not increase the sensitivity to low-order aberrations, suppressing the central leakage of scalar vortex coronagraphs does not restore the aberrations sensitivities to their notional state.</description>

      <title>Preliminary results of sky brightness measurements in near-infrared at Lenghu, China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low sky brightness is crucial for ground-based astronomical observations, because it limits the observational capability to detect fainter sources. Lenghu, located on the Tibetan Plateau in China, has been identified as an high-quality astronomical site in China, including dark sky in optical band. In this work, we will report the preliminary results of near-infrared sky brightness measurements at Lenghu. Utilizing a wide-field small telescope equipped with an InGaAs camera, we have been conducting long-term monitoring of near-infrared sky brightness in the J and H' bands, respectively, since January 2024. For each image, photometry and astrometry were performed, then sky background was calibrated by standard stars from the 2MASS catalog. This report includes preliminary results on the sky brightness at zenith in the J and H' bands, as well as their variations with solar elevation at Lenghu. Our initial results indicate that the near-infrared sky brightness at Lenghu is comparable to that of other world-class sites, and long-term monitoring will be continued.</description>

Abstract: We present DE-VAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to search for a compressed representation of dynamical dark energy (DE) models in observational studies of the cosmic large-scale structure. DE-VAE is trained on matter power spectra boosts generated at wavenumbers $k\in(0.01-2.5) \ h/\rm{Mpc}$ and at four redshift values $z\in(0.1,0.48,0.78,1.5)$ for the most typical dynamical DE parametrization with two extra parameters describing an evolving DE equation of state. The boosts are compressed to a lower-dimensional representation, which is concatenated with standard cold dark matter (CDM) parameters and then mapped back to reconstructed boosts; both the compression and the reconstruction components are parametrized as neural networks. Remarkably, we find that a single latent parameter is sufficient to predict 95% (99%) of DE power spectra generated over a broad range of cosmological parameters within $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) of a Gaussian error which includes cosmic variance, shot noise and systematic effects for a Stage IV-like survey. This single parameter shows a high mutual information with the two DE parameters, and these three variables can be linked together with an explicit equation through symbolic regression. Considering a model with two latent variables only marginally improves the accuracy of the predictions, and adding a third latent variable has no significant impact on the model's performance. We discuss how the DE-VAE architecture can be extended from a proof of concept to a general framework to be employed in the search for a common lower-dimensional parametrization of a wide range of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models and for different cosmological datasets. Such a framework could then both inform the development of cosmological surveys by targeting optimal probes, and provide theoretical insight into the common phenomenological aspects of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models.</description>

      <title>Simulation of radio signals from cosmic-ray cascades in air and ice as observed by in-ice Askaryan radio detectors</title>

Abstract: A new generation of neutrino observatories will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.</description>
