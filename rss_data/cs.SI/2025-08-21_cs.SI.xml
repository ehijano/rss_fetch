      <title>HDBMS: A Context-Aware Hybrid Graph Traversal Algorithm for Efficient Information Discovery in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-searching algorithms play a crucial role in various computational domains, enabling efficient exploration and pathfinding in structured data. Traditional approaches, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), follow rigid traversal patterns -- DFS explores branches exhaustively, while BFS expands level by level. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Depth-Breadth Meaningful Search (HDBMS) algorithm, a novel graph traversal method that dynamically adapts its exploration strategy based on probabilistic node transitions. Unlike conventional methods, HDBMS prioritizes traversal paths by estimating the likelihood that a node contains the desired information, ensuring a more contextually relevant search. Through extensive experimentation on diverse directed graphs with varying structural properties, we demonstrate that HDBMS not only maintains competitive computational efficiency but also outperforms traditional algorithms in identifying meaningful paths. By integrating probabilistic decision-making, HDBMS constructs an adaptive and structured traversal order that balances exploration across depth and breadth, making it particularly effective in applications such as information retrieval, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. Our results highlight the robustness of HDBMS in scenarios where the most valuable connections emerge unpredictably, positioning it as a powerful alternative to traditional graph-searching techniques.</description>

      <title>Non-Dissipative Graph Propagation for Non-Local Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.</description>

      <title>CoBAD: Modeling Collective Behaviors for Human Mobility Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge. Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences (CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

      <title>The Small-World Beneath LEO Satellite Coverage: Ground Hubs in Multi-Shell Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large-scale Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has introduced unprecedented opportunities for global connectivity. However, routing efficiency and inter-shell communication remain key challenges in multi-shell architectures. This paper investigates the structural properties and network dynamics of a representative six-shell mega-constellation composed of 10,956 satellites and 198 gateway stations (GSs). Leveraging tools from complex network analysis, we identify several critical findings: (1) the constellation exhibits strong small-world characteristics, enabling efficient routing despite large network diameters; (2) GS relays play a pivotal role in enhancing inter-shell connectivity by bridging otherwise disconnected components; (3) feeder links significantly reduce average path length, making long-haul communication more feasible; (4) betweenness analysis reveals load imbalances among GSs, indicating the need for traffic-aware management strategies; (5) the architecture offers excellent spatial coverage and resilience, maintaining connectivity and low routing costs even under GS failures. These insights not only explain the design rationale behind current mega-constellations like SpaceX Starlink, but also provide valuable guidance for the evolution of future satellite network infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Messengers: Breaking Echo Chambers in Collective Opinion Dynamics with Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective estimation is a variant of collective decision-making where agents reach consensus on a continuous quantity through social interactions. Achieving precise consensus is complex due to the co-evolution of opinions and the interaction network. While homophilic networks may facilitate estimation in well-connected systems, disproportionate interactions with like-minded neighbors lead to the emergence of echo chambers and prevent consensus. Our agent-based simulations confirm that, besides limited exposure to attitude-challenging opinions, seeking reaffirming information entrap agents in echo chambers. To overcome this, agents can adopt a stubborn state (Messengers) that carry data and connect clusters by physically transporting their opinion. We propose a generic approach based on a Dichotomous Markov Process, which governs probabilistic switching between behavioral states and generates diverse collective behaviors. We study a continuum between task specialization (no switching), to generalization (slow or rapid switching). Messengers help the collective escape local minima, break echo chambers, and promote consensus.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Barycentre of a Set of Graphs with Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of barycentre graph is of crucial importance for machine learning algorithms that process graph-valued data. The barycentre graph is a "summary graph" that captures the mean topology and connectivity structure of a training dataset of graphs. The construction of a barycentre requires the definition of a metric to quantify distances between pairs of graphs. In this work, we use a multiscale spectral distance that is defined using the eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian. The eigenvalues -- but not the eigenvectors -- of the normalized Laplacian of the barycentre graph can be determined from the optimization problem that defines the barycentre. In this work, we propose a structural constraint on the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian of the barycentre graph that guarantees that the barycentre inherits the topological structure of the graphs in the sample dataset. The eigenvectors can be computed using an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases. When the graphs are random realizations of a balanced stochastic block model, then our algorithm returns a barycentre that converges asymptotically (in the limit of large graph size) almost-surely to the population mean of the graphs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator; we conduct experiments on real-life graphs that suggest that our approach works beyond the controlled environment of stochastic block models.</description>

      <title>Towards a general diffusion-based information quality assessment model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid and unregulated dissemination of information in the digital era has amplified the global "infodemic," complicating the identification of high quality information. We present a lightweight, interpretable and non-invasive framework for assessing information quality based solely on diffusion dynamics, demonstrated here in the context of academic publications. Using a heterogeneous dataset of 29,264 sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and social science papers from ArnetMiner and OpenAlex, we model the diffusion network of each paper as a set of three theoretically motivated features: diversity, timeliness, and salience. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on these features achieved Pearson correlations of 0.8468 for next-year citation gain and up to 97.8% accuracy in predicting high-impact papers. Feature relevance studies reveal timeliness and salience as the most robust predictors, while diversity offers less stable benefits in the academic setting but may be more informative in social media contexts. The framework's transparency, domain-agnostic design, and minimal feature requirements position it as a scalable tool for global information quality assessment, opening new avenues for moving beyond binary credibility labels toward richer, diffusion-informed evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</description>
