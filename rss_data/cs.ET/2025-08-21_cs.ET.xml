      <title>Money in Motion: Micro-Velocity and Usage of Ethereums Liquid Staking Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a micro-velocity framework for analysing the on-chain circulation of Lidos liquid-staking tokens, stETH, and its wrapped ERC-20 form, wstETH. By reconstructing full transfer and share-based accounting histories, we compute address-level velocities and decompose them into behavioural components. Despite their growing importance, the micro-level monetary dynamics of LSTs remain largely unexplored. Our data reveal persistently high velocity for both tokens, reflecting intensive reuse within DeFi. Yet activity is highly concentrated: a small cohort of large addresses, likely institutional accounts, are responsible for most turnover, while the rest of the users remain largely passive. We also observe a gradual transition in user behavior, characterized by a shift toward wstETH, the non-rebasing variant of stETH. This shift appears to align with DeFi composability trends, as wstETH is more frequently deployed across protocols such as AAVE, Spark, Balancer, and SkyMoney.
  To make the study fully reproducible, we release (i) an open-source pipeline that indexes event logs and historical contract state, and (ii) two public datasets containing every Transfer and TransferShares record for stETH and wstETH through 2024-11-08. This is the first large-scale empirical characterisation of liquid-staking token circulation. Our approach offers a scalable template for monitoring staking asset flows and provides new, open-access resources to the research community.</description>

      <title>Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum Simulator: A novel quantum simulation system for efficient scaling and cost optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators are essential tools for developing and testing quantum algorithms. However, the high-frequency traversal characteristic of quantum simulators represents an unprecedented demand in the history of IT, and existing distributed technologies is unable to meet this requirement, resulting in a single-node bottleneck of quantum simulator. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum Simulator (DSLSQS). By leveraging an innovative distributed architecture in which multiple computational nodes share data storage directly, together with De-TCP/IP networking technology, DSLSQS effectively eliminates East-West data flow in distributed systems. This approach mitigates the bottleneck of distributed quantum simulation clusters and enhances the scalability. Moreover, the system employs layered storage technology, which reduces usage of expensive high-performance memory and substantially lowers simulation costs. Furthermore, this paper systematically analyzes the performance and cost constraints of distributed quantum simulator cluster, identifying distributed networking as the primary performance bottleneck and highlighting that minimizing storage costs is crucial to reducing the total cost. Finally, experimental evaluations with a 27-qubit simulation confirm the successful implementation of layered storage within the quantum simulator. DSLSQS significantly enhances simulation efficiency, yielding a performance improvement of over 350% compared to existing distributed technologies. These results underscore the superior performance and scalability of the proposed architecture in managing complex quantum computing tasks. This paper provides crucial insights for the practical deployment of quantum computing and presents an effective framework for the development of distributed quantum simulation clusters.</description>

      <title>QVecOpt: An Efficient Storage and Computing Opti-mization Framework for Large-scale Quantum State Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the challenges in large-scale quantum state simulation on classical computing platforms, including memory limits, frequent disk I/O, and high computational complexity, this study builds upon a previously proposed hierarchical storage-based quantum simulation system and introduces an optimization framework, the Quantum Vector Optimization Framework (QVecOpt). QVecOpt integrates four strategies: amplitude pairing, cache optimization, block storage optimization, and parallel optimization. These collectively enhance state vector storage and computational scheduling. The amplitude pairing mechanism locates relevant amplitude pairs via bitwise XOR, reducing traversal complexity of single-qubit gates from $O(2^n)$ to $O(1)$. Cache optimization pre-allocates buffers and loads only required data, cutting disk I/O. Block storage optimization partitions the state vector for on-demand loading and local updates, reducing redundant access. Parallel optimization distributes the state vector across nodes for collaborative computation, achieving near-linear speedup. Complexity analysis shows that, compared with hierarchical storage simulation, the method reduces state vector traversals for single-qubit gates from $2^n$ to 1, removing the main bottleneck. It also lowers computational and I/O complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^n/C)$ and $O(2^n/B)$. In simulations of 16-29 qubits, efficiency improves nearly tenfold, breaking the memory bottleneck of existing tools and enabling high-bit quantum circuit simulations beyond traditional methods. This work provides an efficient, scalable solution for classical simulation of large-scale quantum computation with significant academic and practical value.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Control of Resistance Switching Transitions in First-Order Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Evolving Quantum Key Distribution Network Architecture Using Model-Based Systems Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realisation of significant advances in capabilities of sensors, computing, timing, and communication enabled by quantum technologies is dependent on engineering highly complex systems that integrate quantum devices into existing classical infrastructure. A systems engineering approach is considered to address the growing need for quantum-secure telecommunications that overcome the threat to encryption caused by maturing quantum computation. This work explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks, specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures. Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as candidate modelling languages, the study creates traceable artefacts to promote modular architectures that are reusable for future studies. We propose a variability-driven framework for managing fast-evolving network architectures with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations. The result contributes to the systematic development of viable quantum key distribution networks and supports the investigation of similar integration challenges relevant to the broader context of quantum systems engineering.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Filtering using Variational Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning (QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques, presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to 0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Long Short-term Memory with Differentiable Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning.</description>

      <title>A Solvable Molecular Switch Model for Stable Temporal Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus, the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.</description>

      <title>Fortifying the Agentic Web: A Unified Zero-Trust Architecture Against Logic-layer Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Unified Security Architecture that fortifies the Agentic Web through a Zero-Trust IAM framework. This architecture is built on a foundation of rich, verifiable agent identities using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), with discovery managed by a protocol-agnostic Agent Name Service (ANS). Security is operationalized through a multi-layered Trust Fabric which introduces significant innovations, including Trust-Adaptive Runtime Environments (TARE), Causal Chain Auditing, and Dynamic Identity with Behavioral Attestation. By explicitly linking the LPCI threat to these enhanced architectural countermeasures within a formal security model, we propose a comprehensive and forward-looking blueprint for a secure, resilient, and trustworthy agentic ecosystem. Our formal analysis demonstrates that the proposed architecture provides provable security guarantees against LPCI attacks with bounded probability of success.</description>
