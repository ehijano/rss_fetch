      <title>Transition from adiabatic inspiral to plunge for eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be critical targets for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. They also serve as useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass ratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral can be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic orbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence is determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of motion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any moment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a ``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion. This restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the backreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body approaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and the backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO, its trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly connect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and the final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for circular systems. Here, we study the transition for binaries with eccentricity. A well-defined eccentric transition will make it possible to develop small-mass-ratio binary waveform models that terminate in a physically reasonable way, rather than abruptly terminating as an inspiral-only model ends. A model that can explore the parameter space of eccentricity may also be useful for understanding the final cycles of eccentric binaries at less extreme mass ratios, such as those likely to be observed by ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Effects of Null Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize earlier solutions of gravitational shocks sourced by distributional null stress-energy and analyze their observable effects. A systematic method is proposed to demonstrate consistency between the gravitational effects of a null perfect fluid, i.e. a photon gas, and a collection of gravitational shock waves from point null particles. The anisotropy and time dependence of observable gravitational shifts produced by individual null shocks on a spherically arranged system of clocks relative to a central observer are derived. Shock solutions are used to characterize the angular and temporal spectra of gravitational fluctuations from a photon gas, inherited from the microstructure of the individual null particles. Angular and temporal frequency spectra and correlation functions of gravitational redshift are computed as functions of the ratio of particle impact parameter and transverse size to the size of the measuring sphere. These results are applied to estimate observable large-scale correlations of gravitational fluctuations produced by thermal states of null particles. A pure-phase component of anisotropy is computed from differential gravitational time shifts. It is argued that this component may provide clues to the angular and temporal structure of measurable gravitational vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Direct Limits on Stochastic Length Fluctuations at Radio Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum-Enhanced Space-Time (QUEST) experiment consists of a pair of co-located Power Recycled Michelson Interferometers, each designed to have a broadband, shot-noise limited displacement sensitivity of $2\times10^{-19}$ $\mathrm{m/\sqrt{Hz}}$ from 1 to 200 MHz. Here we present the first results of QUEST that set new upper limits on correlated length fluctuations from 13 to 80 MHz, constituting the first broadband constraints for a stochastic gravitational wave background at these frequencies. In a coincident observing run of $10^{4}$ s the averaging of the cross-correlation spectra between the two interferometer signals resulted in a strain sensitivity of $3\times10^{-20}$ $\mathrm{1/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 40 MHz, making QUEST the most sensitive table-top interferometric system to date.</description>

      <title>Shadows and parameter estimation of rotating quantum corrected black holes and constraints from EHT observation of M87* and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of quantum gravity (QG) inspired rotating black holes limits the progress of testing QG through observational data, such as that from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Recently, the EHT imaged the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, revealing an angular shadow diameter of $d_{sh} = 48.7 \pm 7 \mu$as with a black hole mass of $M = 4.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1} \times 10^6 M\odot$. For M87*, with a mass of $M = (6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$, the EHT measured an angular diameter of $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3 \mu$as. These observations, consistent with Kerr black hole shadows in general relativity, provide opportunities to test gravity and quantum corrections. In this work, we present rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) spacetimes with an additional QC parameter $\alpha$, examine its effect on the shadow properties, and constrain it by EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*. The angular shadow diameter ($d_{sh}$ ) for Sgr A* at $\theta_o = 50^0$, the limits are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.443 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.8066 M)$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the limits are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.447 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.894 M)$. While for M87* at inclination $\theta_o = 17^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 0.8985 M^2$ and $a \in (0.6157M, 0.8511 M)$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the limits are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 0.4141 M^2$ and $a \in (0.8262M, 0.9799 M)$. These results demonstrate that $\alpha$ enormously impacts the shadow's size and shape, providing essential constraints on quantum gravity models. In conjunction with the EHT constraints on the Sgr A* and M87* observables, the RQCBHs and Kerr black holes are indiscernible in the substantial regions of the EHT-constrained parameter space.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Covariant Horava-Lifshitz Gravity from precision measurement of planetary gravitomagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalization of Einstein's theory, Horava-Lifshitz has attracted significant interests due to its healthy ultraviolet behavior. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the Horava-Lifshitz corrections on the gravitomagnetic field. We propose a new planetary gravitomagnetic field measurement method with the help of the space-based laser interferometry, which is further used to constrain the Horava-Lifshitz parameters. Our analysis shows that the high-precision laser gradiometers can indeed limit the parameters in Horava-Lifshitz gravity and improve the results by one or two orders when compared with the existing theories. Our novel method provides insights into constraining the parameters in the modified gravitational theory, which facilitates a deeper understanding of this complex framework and paving the way for potential technological advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Traversability of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter Wormhole in f(T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the traversability of static and evolving Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter wormholes. The wormhole metric under consideration is not asymptotically flat. Hence one can only embed this metric into the Euclidean space for a limited radius $r_{max}$. For $r&gt;r_{max}$, an exterior vacuum spacetime should be matched to the wormhole spacetime. In the framework of $f(T)$ gravities, we discuss the null energy condition that the matter supporting the wormhole should satisfy and find that the nontrivial form of $f(T)$ is necessary. For the wormholes to be suitable for human to traverse, we consider the tidal force that a traveler would have felt during his trip. This leads to an upper bound of the traveler's velocity. Utilizing the velocity allowed, we will estimate the travel time through the wormhole. In the evolving cases, the wormhole should not be expanding too fast, otherwise the traveler may not be able to arrive at the other side of the wormhole. Besides this, for static wormholes, we briefly discuss the geodesics in the plane $\theta=\pi/2$.</description>

      <title>Novel inner shadows of the Kerr black hole illuminated by a tilted thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner shadow of a black hole, as a projection of the event horizon, is regarded as a potential tool for testing gravitational theories and constraining system parameters. Whether this holds in the case of a tilted accretion disk warrants further investigation. In this paper, we employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate images of the Kerr black hole illuminated by a tilted thin accretion disk, with particular attention to the relationship between the inner shadow and system parameters. Our findings reveal that in the case of an equatorial accretion disk, the Kerr black hole exhibits a minimum inner shadow size of $S_{\textrm{min}} = 13.075$ M$^{2}$, where M denotes the black hole mass. This minimum is achieved when the viewing angle is $0^{\circ}$ and the spin parameter approaches $1$. However, with a non-zero disk tilt, the inner shadow exhibits novel configurations--taking on petal, crescent, or eyebrow shapes--significantly smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ across various parameter spaces. This indicates that the inner shadow is highly sensitive to the accretion environment, suggesting that caution is needed when using it as a diagnostic tool for black holes. Notably, an observed inner shadow smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ would either indicate the presence of a tilted accretion disk or support the viability of modified gravity. Moreover, in certain parameter spaces, we identify the emergence of a dual-shadow structure, which could also serve as a probe for the tilted accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Effects of orbital eccentricity on continuous gravitational waveforms from triaxially-deformed precessing neutron stars in tight binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful detection of continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from spinning neutron stars (NSs) will shape our understanding of the physical properties of dense matter under extreme conditions. Binary population synthesis simulations show that forthcoming space-borne GW detectors may be capable of detecting some tight Galactic double NSs (DNSs) with 10-minute orbital periods. Successfully searching for continuous GWs from such a close DNS demands extremely precise waveform templates considering the interaction between the NS and its companion. Unlike the isolated formation channel, the DNSs from the dynamical formation channel have moderate to high orbital eccentricities. To accommodate these systems, we generalize the analytical waveforms from triaxial nonaligned NSs under spin-orbit coupling derived by Feng et al. [Phys. Rev. D 108, 063035 (2023) {https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063035}] to incorporate the effects of the orbital eccentricity. Our findings suggest that for DNSs formed through isolated binary evolution, the impact of eccentricity on the continuous GWs of their NSs can be neglected. In contrast, for DNSs formed through dynamical processes, it is necessary to consider eccentricity, as high-eccentricity orbits can result in a fitting factor of $\lesssim 0.97$ within approximately 0.5 to 2 years of a coherent search. Once the GWs from spinning NSs in tight binaries are detected, the relative measurement accuracy of eccentricity can reach $\Delta e / e \sim O(10^{-7})$ for a signal-to-noise ratio of $O(100)$ based on the Fisher information matrix, bearing significant implications for understanding the formation mechanisms of DNSs.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings in the background of perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter embedded in a cloud of strings. The effects of its surroundings on thermodynamics, timelike and null geodesics, shadows, and quasinormal modes are analyzed. It is demonstrated that changes in spacetime, induced by the surrounding environment, significantly influence the stability, thermal phases, energy dynamics, particle trajectories, and observable features of the black hole's shadow, as well as the oscillation frequency and decay rate.</description>

      <title>Study of Compact Stars and their Properties based on General Relativistic Core-Envelope Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores compact objects, particularly neutron stars, focusing on their properties, classification, and stability within the framework of general relativity. Two distinct studies are presented.
  The first study examines the properties of compact stars, including neutron stars, using an equation of state from a core-envelope model. By solving Einstein's equations with pseudo-spheroidal and spherically symmetric geometries, the mass-radius relationship is derived, leading to the classification of compact stars into three categories: highly compact self-bound stars (radii $&lt;$ 9 km), normal neutron stars (radii 9--12 km), and soft matter neutron stars (radii 12--20 km). Other parameters such as Keplerian frequency, surface gravity, and gravitational redshift are also computed, offering insights into highly compact neutron stars with exotic compositions.
  The second study investigates the impact of density perturbations and local anisotropy on stellar stability. Using the cracking concept and a core-envelope model with anisotropic pressure in the envelope, we explore the potential of these configurations as progenitors for starquakes. The buildup of strain energy in the envelope, linked to anisotropy, can reach up to $10^{50}$ erg -- comparable to energy released in giant gamma-ray bursts. This study thus contributes to understanding the relationship between starquakes and gamma-ray bursts.
  Overall, this work advances the understanding of neutron stars by classifying them based on their radii and investigating the stability of their matter structures, providing new insights into starquakes and their possible connections with gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>A relativistic model of b-EMRI systems and their gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (b-EMRI) is a hierarchical triple system consisting of a stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) orbiting a central Kerr supermassive black hole (SMBH). Although predicted by several astrophysical models, b-EMRIs pose a challenge in waveform modeling due to their complex three-body dynamics and strong relativistic effects. Here we take advantage of the hierarchical nature of b-EMRI systems to transform the internal motion of the small binary into global trajectories around the SMBH. This allows us to use black hole perturbation theory to calculate both the low-frequency gravitational waveform due to its EMRI nature and the high-frequency waveform generated by the inner motion of the BBH. When the inner binary's separation vanishes, our calculation recovers the standard relativistic adiabatic EMRI waveform. Furthermore, by including the high-frequency perturbation, we find a correction to the waveform as large as the adiabatic order when the frequency matches the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the SMBH, therefore supporting an earlier proof-of-concept study claiming that the small BBH can resonantly excite the QNMs of the SMBH. More importantly, we find that b-EMRIs can evolve faster than regular EMRIs due to this resonant dissipation through the high-frequency modes. These characteristics distinguish b-EMRI waveform templates from regular EMRI templates for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The semiclassical propagator for coherent state on twisted geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new set of twisted geometric variables is introduced to parametrize the holonomy-flux phase space in loop quantum gravity. It is verified that these new geometric variables, after symplectic reduction with respect to the Gauss constraint, form a Poisson algebra which is analogue to that in quantum mechanics. This property ensures that these new geometric variables provide a simple path measure, upon which a new formulation of coherent state path integral based on twisted geometry coherent state is established in loop quantum gravity. Especially, this path integral is analytically computable by expanding the corresponding effective action around the complex evolution trajectories at second order, and the result gives the semi-classical approximation of the quantum propagator between twisted geometry coherent state in LQG.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider smooth Gowdy-symmetric generalised Taub-NUT solutions, a class of inhomogeneous cosmological models with spatial three-sphere topology. They are characterised by existence of a smooth past Cauchy horizon and, with the exception of certain singular cases, they also develop a regular future Cauchy horizon. Several examples of exact solutions were previously constructed, where the initial data (in form of the initial Ernst potentials) are polynomials of low degree. Here, we generalise to polynomial initial data of arbitrary degree. Utilising methods from soliton theory, we obtain a simple algorithm that allows us to construct the resulting Ernst potential with purely algebraic calculations. We also derive an explicit formula in terms of determinants, and we illustrate the method with two examples.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations of a relativistic MOND theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic MOND theory, promising in reproducing cosmology as well as the MOND phenomenology in the low acceleration regime, was recently proposed. We present the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and relativistic perturbation equations of this theory in cosmological context. The PN equations are presented to 1PN order and perturbation equations are presented in fully-nonlinear and exact forms. The gauge issues are clarified. The 1PN equations and linear perturbation equations are presented without imposing temporal gauge conditions. The MOND field can be interpreted as a fluid with specific equation of state without anisotropic stress, and the Jeans criterion is derived for the MOND field.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Unequal Noises and Foreground Modeling on SGWB Reconstruction with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) of cosmological origin with LISA, it is crucial to account for realistic complications in the noise and astrophysical foreground modeling that may impact the signal reconstruction. To address these challenges, we updated the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code to incorporate both variable noise levels across LISA arms and more complex foreground spectral shapes. Our findings suggest that, while moderate variations of the noise amplitudes have a minimal impact, poor foreground modeling (i.e., templates requiring many free parameters) significantly degrades the reconstruction of cosmological signals. This underlines the importance of accurate modeling and subtraction of the astrophysical foregrounds to characterize possible cosmological components. To perform this more challenging analysis, we have integrated the $\texttt{JAX}$ framework, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of the code, in the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code, enabling faster Bayesian likelihood sampling and more effective exploration of complex SGWB signals.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory spacelike singularities: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ vacuum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$, $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$ vacuum models all have 4-dimensional Hubble-normalized state spaces and are expected to have a generic initial oscillatory singularity, but the invariant boundary sets responsible for the oscillations are much more complicated for type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ than those of type $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$. For the first time, we explicitly solve the equations on these type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ boundary sets and also introduce a new graphic representation of the associated network of heteroclinic chains (i.e. sequences of solutions describing the oscillations). In particular, we give examples of networks of entangled cyclic heteroclinic chains and show that only some of these cyclic heteroclinic chains are asymptotically relevant.</description>

      <title>Circumventing Quantum Gravity: Black Holes Evaporating into Macroscopic Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, metrics that describe regular black holes, extreme black holes, or traversable wormholes have been widely discussed. These spacetimes, appearing in scenarios such as the brane world, are contingent on the values of the parameters, with each metric encompassing all three objects. We are considering various known models for these black hole/wormhole interpolating spacetimes and showing that, starting from the macroscopic black holes, all of them must evaporate into macroscopic wormholes, thus avoiding existential problems related to the final stages of black hole evaporation and issues of quantum gravity and black hole remnants. For this purpose, we are calculating the energy emission rates of black holes and the appropriate lifetimes. We argue that some of our conclusions should hold regardless of the specific model, as long as it permits an extremal black hole state with zero temperature at a particular value of the coupling constant.</description>

Abstract: In this article we address the mystery of dark matter. We expound the various evidences, astrophysical and cosmological, leading to hypothesize the existence of an invisible form of matter, whose attempts at detecting it have so far all failed. We also discuss some alternative suggestions that replace the hypothesis of exotic matter with the assumption of modifications of the gravitational dynamics. For each of the various proposals we also discuss the strong and weak points.</description>

We will expound in detail the motivations that led to hypothesise the existence of dark energy, the importance of understanding its nature, its main possible theoretical explanations and a list of the many attempts at modelling it. We conclude with a description of the most recent and future missions on Earth and in space devised to shed light on this mystery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact solutions for the cosmological embedding of a broad class of non-singular black holes, demonstrating that these objects exhibit an apparent horizon. The evolution of the latter is analyzed as a function of the cosmological redshift $z$. We show that its size exceeds that of the event horizon of an isolated black hole and increases monotonically with increasing $z$. Explicit formulas and numerical results are provided for the specific cases of the Hayward and Fan $\&amp;$ Wang non-singular black-hole models. Furthermore, we explore the distinct dynamical roles of the event and apparent horizons, highlighting connection between the latter and the recently identified cosmological mass shift in non-singular black holes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Power Law and Exponential models in $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we observationally test the \( f(Q) \) gravity model at both background and perturbation levels using Pantheon$^+$, Hubble measurements, and Redshift Space Distortion Data. We obtain the best-fit parameters by solving numerically the modified Friedmann equations for two distinct cosmological models of \( f(Q) \) gravity namely the Power law and Exponential models. This involves performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for these specific forms of \( f(Q) \). To evaluate the statistical significance of the \( f(Q) \) gravity models, we use the Bayesian and corrected Akaike Information Criteria. Our results indicate that the Exponential model in \( f(Q) \) gravity is statistically favored over both the Power-law model and the \( \Lambda \)CDM model.</description>

      <title>Some singular spacetimes and their possible alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a brief review article of a seminar given at the International Conference on Gravitation, Astrophysics and Cosmology 2024 (ICGAC-2024), Mathura, India. We begin with a historical survey of some singular solutions in the theory of gravitation, as well as a very brief discussion of how black holes could physically form. Some possible scenarios which could perhaps eliminate these singularities are then reviewed and discussed. Due to the vastness of the field the coverage is not exhaustive, but instead the concentration is on a small subset of topics such as possible quantum gravity effects, non-commutative geometry, and gravastars. A simple singularity theorem is also presented in the appendix. Although parts of the manuscript assume some familiarity with relativistic gravitation or differential geometry, the aim is for the broad picture to be accessible to non-specialists of other physical sciences and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein static Universe with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de Sitter state and the static Einstein Universe are the unique states, which have constant Ricci scalar curvature ${\cal R}$. Earlier it was shown that such unique symmetry of the de Sitter state leads to the special thermodynamic properties of this state, which are determined by the local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$, where $R$ is the radius of the cosmological horizon. Then, what happens in static Universe? We consider the Einstein Universe, which has boundary. This can be the real physical boundary, or the border between two halves of the $R\times S^3$ Universe, if there is no contact between the halves. It appears that the static Einstein Universe with boundary is characterized by the same local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$ as the de Sitter state. The thermodynamics of the bounded Einstein Universe is also similar to that of de Sitter. If this Universe contains Zel'dovich stiff matter, there is the holographic connection between the entropy of the Universe and the surface entropy $A/4G$ of the boundary. This means that in thermodynamics the physical boundary of the static Einstein Universe plays the role of the de Sitter cosmological horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Effective Field Theory techniques to derive the quadrupole-quadrupole part of the gravitational wave, obtaining a waveform in agreement with previous results found within the multipolar-post-Minkowskian method. In particular we emphasize the role of radiation-reaction terms, which affect the energy-momentum balance between source and radiation. An in-in effective action is then derived along the same principles and it is shown to provide energy and angular momentum balance equations in agreement with the corresponding fluxes carried at infinity by gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Black Holes: Apparent Horizon Versus Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical black holes have an apparent horizon as one of their characteristics. The later might be null, time-like, or space-like surfaces that define the evolution of a black hole. Our study examines how an apparent horizon's behavior is influenced by the null energy condition in spherically-symmetric spacetime. If the location of an apparent horizon and the NEC horizon coincide, it is proven to be null surface. The outer apparent horizon may appear time-like despite the growth of the black hole mass, which must be astrophysical important because the shadow of a black hole always decreases. We show that if NEC is satisfied everywhere in spacetime, then the dynamical black hole asymptotically tends to Vaidya black hole. Our research demonstrates that evaporation of a regular black hole consistently results in a horizonless object with a regular center, which opens the possibility of elucidating the information loss paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological models based on an asymmetric scalar Higgs doublet (canonical $\Phi$ and phantom $\phi$ fields) with potential interaction between the components are proposed. A qualitative analysis of the corresponding dynamic systems is performed and their transformation properties with respect to similarity transformations of fundamental constants are revealed. Asymptotic behavior of this class of cosmological models near cosmological singularities is investigated. Numerical simulations revealed a number of interesting features of these models, in particular, the possibility of a fairly long ``waiting phase'', during which the Universe is almost Euclidean, as well as the presence of bounce points, in the vicinity of which strong oscillations of scalar potentials occur. Keywords: Asymmetric scalar Higgs doublet, cosmological models, qualitative analysis, asymptotic behavior, waiting phase, bounces.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation relation of test masses in classical stochastic gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on pulsar timing arrays has provided preliminary evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational background, which, either being primordial or of astrophysical origin, will interact universally with matter distributions in our universe and affect their evolutions. This work, based on general relativity and stochastic dynamics theory, investigates the fluctuation-dissipation relation of isolated celestial bodies within a classical stochastic gravitational wave background. We employ the generalized Langevin model to analyze the fluctuating forces exerted on test masses by random spacetime and how energy dissipation occurs. Through the assumption of equilibrium, we derive the necessary conditions that should be satisfied by the stochastic gravitational wave background in the long wavelength limit, which, as we found, is a result of the back-reactions of the test mass system to the stochastic field. Additionally, as the establishment of the fluctuation-dissipation relation for such a system, certain thermodynamic quantities related to the statistical properties of the stochastic gravitational wave background could be defined and the characteristic of the diffusion process of test masses is obtained.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum and linear perturbations of ghost-free multi-spin-2 theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the spin-2 nature of gravity, we consider a theory of N interacting spin-2 fields, formulated in terms of vielbeins which have been argued to be free of the Boulware-Deser ghost. This is the only known such theory with nontrivial multi-field interactions. We develop an all-order expansion of the vielbein in terms of the metric and Lorentz field perturbations, enabling an expansion of the action in arbitrary backgrounds to any order. The mass matrix is then analysed around proportional vielbein solutions corresponding to vacuum Einstein spacetimes. It is shown that the theory exhibits a non-tachyonic spectrum with one massless and N-1 massive spin-2 modes, regardless of the sign of the cosmological constant. While the massless mode is universal, the non-zero masses cannot generally be determined analytically, but we obtain the lower and upper bounds on each mass eigenvalue in terms of the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Connecting Inflation to the NANOGrav 15-year Data Set via Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) missions have reported convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background within their latest datasets. This background could originate from an astrophysical source, though there are multiple possibilities for its origin to be cosmological. Focusing on the NANOGrav signal, which was in good agreement with other PTAs, we evaluate the possibility of an inflationary source for the background. However, we'll consider a time-dependent minimal theory of massive gravity instead of standard general relativity for our analysis. We find that an inflationary interpretation will require a strongly blue spectrum, characterized by $n_T = 1.8 \, \pm \, 0.54$, while Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits will require a low reheating scale of $T_\text{rh} \simeq 4000 \ \text{GeV}$. Though these constraints make it difficult for inflation to be the source of the NANOGrav signal, we find that the massive gravity model allows for a greater reheating temperature than standard general relativity, making an inflationary interpretation slightly less cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Solar Plasma Noise in TianQin Laser Propagation: An Extreme Case and Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TianQin proposes to detect gravitational wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TianQin. In this work, we used MHD simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the magnetohydrodynamic simulation result, we investigate laser propagation noise for TianQin. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination; While the laser propagation noise is still about 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and $D$st, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure is strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15\%. In addition, we find that time-delay interferometry can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30\% of TianQin's requirement to less than 1\%.</description>

      <title>State-space analysis of a continuous gravitational wave source with a pulsar timing array: inclusion of the pulsar terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays can detect continuous nanohertz gravitational waves emitted by individual supermassive black hole binaries. The data analysis procedure can be formulated within a time-domain, state-space framework, in which the radio timing observations are related to a temporal sequence of latent states, namely the intrinsic pulsar spin frequency. The achromatic wandering of the pulsar spin frequency is tracked using a Kalman filter concurrently with the pulse frequency modulation induced by a gravitational wave from a single source. The modulation is the sum of terms proportional to the gravitational wave strain at the Earth and at every pulsar in the array. Here we generalize previous state-space formulations of the pulsar timing array problem to include the pulsar terms; that is, we copy the pulsar terms from traditional, non-state-space analyses over to the state-space framework. The performance of the generalized Kalman filter is tested using astrophysically representative software injections in Gaussian measurement noise. It is shown that including the pulsar terms corrects for previously identified biases in the parameter estimates (especially the sky position of the source) which also arise in traditional matched-filter analyses that exclude the pulsar terms. Additionally, including the pulsar terms decreases the minimum detectable strain by $14\%$. Overall, the study verifies that the pulsar terms do not raise any special extra impediments for the state-space framework, beyond those studied in traditional analyses. The inspiral-driven evolution of the wave frequency at the Earth and at the retarded time at every pulsar in the array is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from $N_{\text{eff}}$ : scalar induced gravitational waves as an extra radiation component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In June 2023, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. Scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, \acp{PBH} inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\text{eff}}$. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of $N_{\text{eff}}$ to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of \acp{PBH}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shear viscoelasticity in a simple holographic axion model with broken translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in space via the perturbation computation. We find that, in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the broken translations and anisotropy both enhance the shear elasticity of the system. While in all cases, they introduce a double suppression on the shear viscosity, which is in contrast to the result from the study of the p-wave holographic superfluid where the shear viscosity is enhanced when the rotational symmetry is broken spontaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently suggested (arxiv:2410.06604) that the small value of the dark energy of the universe could be explained in terms of the scale of neutrino masses through a simple quantum field theoretic mechanism. I clarify that the quantity computed is only a threshold correction to the vacuum energy at the low $m_\nu$ scale, and therefore cannot explain the magnitude of the vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations.</description>

      <title>Testing interacting dark energy with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys through differentiable neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a novel framework for accelerated cosmological inference, based on neural emulators and gradient-based sampling methods, to forecast constraints on dark energy models from Stage IV cosmic shear surveys. We focus on dark scattering (DS), an interacting dark energy model with pure momentum exchange in the dark sector, and train COSMOPOWER emulators to accurately and efficiently model the DS non-linear matter power spectrum produced by the halo model reaction framework, including the effects of baryon feedback and massive neutrinos. We embed the emulators within a fully-differentiable pipeline for gradient-based cosmological inference for which the batch likelihood call is up to $O(10^5)$ times faster than with traditional approaches, producing parameter constraints from simulated Stage IV cosmic shear data running on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). We also perform model comparison on the output chains from the inference process, employing the learnt harmonic mean estimator implemented in the software HARMONIC. We investigate degeneracies between dark energy and systematics parameters and assess the impact of scale cuts on the final constraints. Assuming a DS model for the mock data vector, we find that a Stage IV survey cosmic shear analysis can constrain the DS amplitude parameter $A_{\mathrm{ds}}$ with an uncertainty roughly an order of magnitude smaller than current constraints from Stage III surveys, even after marginalising over baryonic feedback, intrinsic alignments and redshift distribution uncertainties. These results show great promise for constraining DS with Stage IV data; furthermore, our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>The primordial non-Gaussianities for non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have acquired and analyzed the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and the corresponding non-Gaussianities in the particular model of the contracting Universe with strong gravity in the past within the framework of the Horndeski theory. The found shape function of the bispectrum did not correspond to the widely used local, equilateral, orthogonal or enfolded shapes. We also evaluate non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ for different wave numbers $\vec{k}_1$, $\vec{k}_2$, $\vec{k}_3$ configurations. The convenient ones in our case are: (i) $k_1=k_2$, $k_3\to 0$ (local configuration of wave numbers); (ii) $k_1=k_2=k_3$ (equilateral configuration); (iii) the enfolded one, where $k_1=k_2+k_3$, what is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal configurations. For each configuration it is possible to satisfy the current observational bounds for non-linear parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ even under the restrictions of the applicability of regime, where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory at all times. However, the region of healthy parameters in our model is arranged so that one can not satisfy experimental constraints for all different non-linear parameters $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{local}}$, $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{equil}}$, and $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{enfold}}$ at once.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that various dynamical gauge theories in two, three and four dimensions, which are obtained as Manin deformations of topological Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theories, are equivalent to gravitational theories. Since gravity is topological in two and three dimension, this equivalence requires a diffeorphism breaking background source term. In four dimensions, however, the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant is obtained identically via the Manin deformation of a particular Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider a bulk plus boundary extension of Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity (JT) coupled with Yang-Mills fields. The generalization is performed in the Poisson Sigma Model formulation. We discuss the role of boundary conditions in relation to the symmetries of the boundary dynamics and we show that the boundary action can be written in terms of coadjoint orbits of an appropriate Virasoro-Kac-Moody group. We obtain a Schwarzian action and interaction terms with additional edge modes that matches the effective low energy action of recent SYK-like tensor models. Finally, we discuss the duality relations also from a three dimensional perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geodesic motion in a Lorentzian spacetime can be described by trajectories in a $3-$dimensional Riemannian metric. In this article we present a generalized Jacobi metric obtained from projecting a Lorentzian metric over the directions of its Killing vectors. The resulting Riemannian metric inherits the geodesics for asymptotically flat spacetimes including the stationary and axisymmetric ones. The method allows us to find Riemannian metrics in three and two dimensions plus the radial geodesic equation when we project over three different directions. The $3-$dimensional Riemannian metric reduces to the Jacobi metric when static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes are considered. However, it can be calculated for a larger variety of metrics in any number of dimensions. We show that the geodesics of the original spacetime metrics are inherited by the projected Riemannian metric. We calculate the Gaussian and geodesic curvatures of the resulting $2-$dimensional metric, we study its near horizon and asymptotic limit. We also show that this technique can be used for studying the violation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in the context of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the nonrelativistic approximation in the curved-space Dirac equation, the analog of the Pauli equation is derived for a weak gravitational field with a gauge fixing condition related to the synchronous gauge, in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Different from the previous works which were employing either the exact or conventional Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations, here we perform calculations by directly performing nonrelativistic approximation which reduced in the power series expansion in the inverse mass of the spinning particle. On top of that, the equations of motion for the massive spin-$1/2$ charged particle are obtained. The two particular cases of the previously explored backgrounds, namely a) plane gravitational wave and b) homogeneous static gravitational field are considered for control. In the case a) we meet correspondence with the previous results. On the other hand, in case b), there is no correspondence with neither perturbative nor with exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations, which we also recalculate and agree with the previous works. The disagreement is a kind of a theoretical challenge and most likely occurs because the potential energy, in the particular case of Newtonian approximation, is proportional to the mass of the particle.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal Love numbers of Kerr-like compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework to compute the tidal response of a Kerr-like compact object in terms of its reflectivity, compactness, and spin, both in the static and the frequency-dependent case. Here we focus on the low-frequency regime, which can be solved fully analytically. We highlight some remarkable novel features, in particular: i) Even in the zero-frequency limit, the tidal Love numbers (TLNs) depend on the linear-in-frequency dependence of the object's reflectivity in a nontrivial way. ii) Intriguingly, the static limit of the frequency-dependent TLNs is discontinuous, therefore the static TLNs differ from the static limit of the (phenomenologically more interesting) frequency-dependent TLNs. This shows that earlier findings regarding the static TLNs of ultracompact objects correspond to a measure-zero region in the parameter space, though the logarithmic behavior of the TLNs in the black hole limit is retained. iii) In the non-rotating case, the TLNs generically vanish in the zero-frequency limit (just like for a black hole), except when the reflectivity is ${\cal R}=1+{\cal O}(M\omega)$, in which case they vanish with a model-dependent scaling, which is generically logarithmic, in the black-hole limit. The TLNs initially grow with frequency, for any nonzero reflectivity, and then display oscillations and resonances tied up with the quasi-normal modes of the object. iv) For rotating compact objects, the TLNs decrease when the reflectivity decreases or the rotation parameter increases. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork to develop model-independent tests of the nature of compact objects using tidal effects in gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Effects of gravity rainbow on scalar bosonic and oscillator fields in Bonnor-Melvin space-time with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relativistic quantum motion of spin-zero scalar charge-free particles influenced by rainbow gravity's (RG's) in Bonnor-Melvin magnetic space-time, a four-dimensional solution featuring a positive cosmological constant. We solve the Klein-Gordon equation in this scenario by using two sets of rainbow function: (i) $f(\chi)=\frac{1}{(1-\beta\,\chi)}$,\,\, $h(\chi)=1$ and (ii) $f(\chi)=\frac{1}{(1-\beta\,\chi)}=h(\chi)$, where $0 &lt; \chi\left(=\frac{|E|}{E_p}\right) \leq 1$ with $E_p$ being the Planck's energy, $E$ is the particle's energy, and $\beta$ is the rainbow parameter. Furthermore, we study the relativistic quantum oscillator through the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation in the same Bonnor-Melvin magnetic space-time under RG effects. Employing the first pair of rainbow function, we obtain an approximate eigenvalue solution of the quantum oscillator fields. Notably, we demonstrate that the relativistic energy profile of scalar and oscillator particles are influenced by the topology of the geometry and the cosmological constant which is related with the magnetic field strength lies along the symmetry axis. Additionally, we see the impact of rainbow parameter on these approximate relativistic energy profiles in both quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints and Cosmographic Analysis of $f({T},{T}_{{G}})$ Gravity and Cosmology</title>

Abstract: We perform observational confrontation and cosmographic analysis of $f(T,T_G)$ gravity and cosmology. This higher-order torsional gravity is based on both the torsion scalar, as well as on the teleparallel equivalent of the Gauss--Bonnet combination, and gives rise to an effective dark-energy sector which depends on the extra torsion contributions. We employ observational data from the Hubble function and supernova Type Ia Pantheon datasets, applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique, and we provide the iso-likelihood contours, as well as the best-fit values for the parameters of the power-law model, an ansatz which is expected to be a good approximation of most realistic deviations from general relativity. Additionally, we reconstruct the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, which exhibits a quintessence-like behavior, while in the future the Universe enters into the phantom regime, before it tends asymptotically to the cosmological constant value. Furthermore, we perform a detailed cosmographic analysis, examining the deceleration, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters, showing that the transition to acceleration occurs in the redshift range $ 0.52 \leq z_{tr} \leq 0.89 $, as well as the preference of the scenario for quintessence-like behavior. Finally, we apply the Om</description>

      <title>Existence and absence of Killing horizons in static solutions with symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Without specifying a matter field nor imposing energy conditions, we study Killing horizons in $n(\ge 3)$-dimensional static solutions in general relativity with an $(n-2)$-dimensional Einstein base manifold. Assuming linear relations $p_{\rm r}\simeq\chi_{\rm r} \rho$ and $p_2\simeq\chi_{\rm t} \rho$ near a Killing horizon between the energy density $\rho$, radial pressure $p_{\rm r}$, and tangential pressure $p_2$ of the matter field, we prove that any non-vacuum solution satisfying $\chi_{\rm r}&lt;-1/3$ ($\chi_{\rm r}\ne -1$) or $\chi_{\rm r}&gt;0$ does not admit a horizon as it becomes a curvature singularity. For $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$, non-vacuum solutions admit Killing horizons, on which there exists a matter field only for $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $-1/3$, which are of the Hawking-Ellis type~I and type~II, respectively. Differentiability of the metric on the horizon depends on the value of $\chi_{\rm r}$, and non-analytic extensions beyond the horizon are allowed for $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$. In particular, solutions can be attached to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-type vacuum solution at the Killing horizon in at least a $C^{1,1}$ regular manner without a lightlike thin shell. We generalize some of those results in Lovelock gravity with a maximally symmetric base manifold.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the gravitational emission from particles scattering via the Yukawa interaction, presenting both classical and approximate quantum results. We also estimate the contribution from the tensor part of the internucleon interaction. This emission is the main source of a very-high frequency component to the stochastic background in the Solar System and in neutron stars. The emission from the Sun (allowing for Debye screening) and from a typical neutron star are obtained. The gravitational wave luminosity of the Sun is $41 \pm 10$ MW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive study of wormhole configurations in $\kappa(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})$ gravity with linear and non-linear functions. The model assumed Morrison-Thorne spacetime where the redshift and shape functions linked with the matter contain and geometry of the spacetime through non-covariant conservation equation of the stress-energy tensor. The first solution was explored assuming a constant redshift function that leads to a wormhole (WH) which is asymptotically non-flat. The remaining solutions were explored in two cases. Firstly, assuming a linear equation of state $p(r)=\omega \rho(r)$ along with different forms of $\kappa(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})-$function. This proved enough to derive a shape function of the form $b(r)=r_{0}\left(\frac{r_{0}}{r}\right)^{1/\omega}$. Secondly, by assuming specific choices of the shape function consistent with the wormhole configuration requirements. All the solutions fulfill flare-out condition, asymptotically flat and supported by phantom energy. Further, the embedding surface and its revolution has been generated using numerical method to see how the length of the throat is affected of the coupling parameters through $\kappa(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})$ function. At the end, we have also calculated the average null energy condition, which is satisfied by all the WH models signifying minimum exotic matter is required to open the WH throats.</description>

      <title>Investigating cosmic histories with a stiff era through Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of gravitational-wave background searches to constrain cosmic histories characterised by a stiff equation of state, preceded by a period of matter domination. Such a scenario leads to a characteristic peak in the primordial gravitational-wave spectrum originating from cosmological inflation. Assuming instant transitions between distinct epochs, which allows an analytical treatment of the gravitational-wave spectrum, we perform a Bayesian inference analysis to derive constraints from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Additionally, we consider a smooth transition, employing an axion-like particle physics model, and highlight the difference with the instant transition approximation. We then forecast detection prospects for such a cosmic history through future gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the influence of graviton fluctuations on the inflationary spectrum with a Kucha\v{r}-Torre clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the search for a coherent and consistent formulation to describe quantum gravity corrections to Quantum Field Theory. We implement two fundamental ingredients discussed in previous analyses: on one hand, the construction of the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin and Born-Oppenheimer picture for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory of gravity and matter by using a reference fluid as physical clock; on the other hand, we explicitly separate in the metric field its own purely classical contribution from the quantum graviton degrees of freedom. This allows to derive, by the expansion in a Planckian parameter, a unitary theory properly evaluating the Quantum Field Theory modifications in the considered regime. More specifically, we recover at zero order the standard theory on curved space-time after averaging over the graviton sector. The physical corrections are induced at first order by (quantum) gravitons, thought as the slow-varying component of the system, as opposed to the fast quantum matter and reference fluid. The genuine contribution due to gravitons, non-factorizable into an independent phase, provides a coherent quantum gravity modification on Quantum Field Theory. We show this by determining the predicted inflationary spectrum during an exact de Sitter phase of the primordial Universe, finding a breaking of the scale invariant morphology even when the inflation potential is modelled by a cosmological constant term. Remarkably, the behavior of such non-scale-invariant spectrum overlaps predictions previously obtained in literature by neglecting non-unitary terms emerging in those formulations. In this respect, the present model provides a satisfactory regularization of such approaches, by virtue of a more realistic construction of the physical clock for the total (gravity + matter) quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes with subcell finite volume limiter and adaptive mesh refinement for a monolithic first-order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein-Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme with subcell finite volume (FV) limiter to solve a monolithic first--order hyperbolic BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The numerical scheme runs with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in three space dimensions, is endowed with time-accurate local time stepping (LTS) and is able to deal with both conservative and non-conservative hyperbolic systems. The system of governing partial differential equations was shown to be strongly hyperbolic and is solved in a monolithic fashion with one numerical framework that can be simultaneously applied to both the conservative matter subsystem as well as the non-conservative subsystem for the spacetime. Since high order unlimited DG schemes are well-known to produce spurious oscillations in the presence of discontinuities and singularities, our subcell finite volume limiter is crucial for the robust discretization of shock waves arising in the matter as well as for the stable treatment of puncture black holes. We test the new method on a set of classical test problems of numerical general relativity, showing good agreement with available exact or numerical reference solutions. In particular, we perform the first long term evolution of the inspiralling merger of two puncture black holes with a high order ADER-DG scheme.</description>

      <title>Structural Implications of the Chameleon Mechanism on White Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of the chameleon mechanism on the structure of white dwarfs. Using a shooting method of our design, we solve the corresponding scalar-tensor equilibrium equations for a Chandrasekhar equation of state, exploring various energy scales and couplings of the chameleon field to matter. For the considered parameter ranges, we find the chameleon field to be in a thick-shell configuration, identifying for the first time in the literature a similarity relation of the theory for the radially normalised scalar field gradient. Our analysis reveals that the chameleon mechanism alters the internal pressure of white dwarfs, leading to a reduction in the stellar radii and masses and shifting the mass-radius curves below those predicted by Newtonian gravity. This lowers also the specific heat of white dwarfs, accelerating their cooling process. Finally, we derive parametric expressions from our results to expedite future analyses of white dwarfs in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

Abstract: We study closed string evolution in the pp-wave spacetime assuming different pulse shapes (square and sech-squared) in the exact gravitational wave metric. It is shown that the shape of a circular closed string deforms permanently, after the pulse has departed. The worldsheet geometry also displays characteristic permanent changes caused by the gravitational wave pulse. The above effects collectively demonstrate features akin to what is known as `memory' in gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Is the type-D NUT C-metric really "missing" from the most general Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains a long-standing problem, unsettled for almost two decades in General Relativity (GR) community, ever since Griffiths and Podolsky demonstrated in Ref. [J.B. Griffiths and J. Podolsky, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, 3467 (2005)] that the type-D NUT C-metric seems to be absent from the most general family of the type-D Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski (P-D) solution. However, Astorino [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084038 (2024)] presented a different form of rotating and accelerating black holes and showed that all known four-dimensional type-D accelerating black holes (without the NUT charge) can be recovered via various different limits in a definitive fashion. In particular, he provided, for the first time, the correct expressions for the type-D static accelerating black holes with a nonzero NUT charge, which was previously impossible using the traditional parametrization of the familiar P-D solution. Nevertheless, it still remains elusive that how these two different forms of the four-dimensional rotating and accelerating solutions are related. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by finding the obvious coordinate transformations and parameter identifications between the vacuum metrics after two different parameterizations of the generated solution via the inverse scattering method from the seed metric -- the Rindler vacuum background. We then resolve this ``missing" puzzle by providing another M\"{o}bius transformation and linear combinations of the Killing coordinates, which clearly cast the type-D NUT C-metric into the familiar form of the P-D solution. Additionally, we propose an alternative new routine for the normalization of the obtained metric derived via the inverse scattering method from the vacuum seed solution, which could be potentially useful for the construction of higher-dimensional solutions using the trivial vacuum background as the seed metric.</description>

Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, static and spherically symmetric solutions of the general relativity coupled to linear/nonlinear electrodynamics and a dust fluid (GR-ED-DF) are studied. We demonstrate that these solutions can be categorized into two sets, both having an electromagnetically charged metric, but with the following conditions: (i) a variable redshift function, without a dust fluid as source, and (ii) a constant redshift function, with a dust fluid as source. Using (i), we provide a simple proof of the nonexistence of static and spherically symmetric traversable Morris-Thorne wormhole solutions with variable redshift functions in GR-ED-DF. Whereas using (ii), we construct several static and spherically symmetric traversable Morris-Thorne wormholes with constant redshift function in GR-ED-DF, where the source of gravity consists of a dust fluid having negative energy density and an electromagnetic field described by a physically reasonable model of linear/nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F})$ depending only on the electromagnetic invariant $\mathcal{F}\!=\!F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}\!/4$, where $F_{\alpha\beta}$ are the components of the electromagnetic field tensor. We show that in the limit of the weak electromagnetic field, each of our solutions become a traversable wormhole of the electromagnetically charged Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole type. Additionally, we present a theorem that establishes when an electrically and magnetically charged Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, with null $\mathcal{F}$, can be supported by a GR-ED-DF theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of quark stars with two different equations of state in generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. This theory corresponds to a bi-scalar gravitational theory in which there are two non-minimally-coupled scalar fields. The field equations of the metric tensor and scalar fields are derived by varying the action with respect to the dynamical fields. We obtain the field equations for static spherically symmetric geometry interior of compact objects. The numerical solutions for two types of quark stars, the MIT bag and CFL model are studied. The solutions reveal the structure of the compact objects. The solutions are obtained for different values of the model parameters. All considered cases show that compact objects are more massive than their general relativity counterpart. The surface redshift and compactness are also obtained which shows that the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini quark stars have higher surface redshift and are more compact than general relativity quark stars.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of charged gravastars in torsion-based $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity in the presence of noncommutative geometry. We have taken the interior from noncommutative motivated space-time, noting that why, from a physical point of view, such a choice is justified, then we have taken the thin shell as stiff matter and taken three different exterior metrics (Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N), Bardeen and Ayon-Beato-Garcia (ABG) metric) to construct the gravastar model. We have studied the physical properties like proper length, entropy, energy, and EoS for these models, and we have also used Israel junction conditions to study the effective pressure, energy density, and potential of the thin shell. Finally, we comment on the stability of such a thin shell and the deflection angle caused by such a thin shell, which could, in principle, be tested by future radio telescopes like the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Multicomponent Dark Energy Model and the Possibility of Early Dark Energy Like Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics and phase-space behavior of a multicomponent dark energy model, where the dark sector consists of a minimally coupled canonical scalar field and the cosmological constant, using a dynamical system analysis setup for various types of potentials for which a general parameterisation of the scalar field potentials has been considered. Several fixed points with different cosmological behaviours have been identified. A detailed stability analysis has been done and possible late-time attractors have been found. For this multi-component dark energy model, the late-time attractors are either fully dominated by the cosmological constant or represent a scenario where a combination of the scalar field and the cosmological constant dominates the universe. We have also shown that for this type of model, the scalar field can show early dark energy (EDE) like behaviour. However, our analysis indicates that this EDE like behaviour occurs naturally deep in the matter-dominated era, not before the recombination era.</description>

      <title>The (1+3)-dimensional 'quantum principle of relativity' is Einstein's principle of relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer, travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator together with an arbitrary relabeling. Physically, it corresponds to staying put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as `space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes \cite{Dragan:2019grn}, to ordinary Minkowski space \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, is simply Einstein's principle of relativity, proposed in 1905.</description>

      <title>Validity of black hole complementarity in an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity has been well understood in spherically symmetric black holes. To study its validity for an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole, which has a preferred direction, we perform the thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius and further investigate the criteria set by Hayden and Preskill. First, we derive thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Using these quantities, we conduct thought experiments based on the Page time and the scrambling time, which show that black hole complementarity remains valid, although the energy required for the duplication of information depends on the angle due to the axisymmetric metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of quantum theory over discrete systems is extended in two significant ways. First, quantum evolutions are generalized to act over entire network configurations, so that nodes may find themselves in a quantum superposition of being connected or not, and be allowed to merge, split and reconnect coherently in a superposition. Second, tensors and traceouts are generalized, so that systems can be partitioned according to almost arbitrary logical predicates in a robust manner. The hereby presented mathematical framework is anchored on solid grounds through numerous lemmas. Indeed, one might have feared that the familiar interrelations between the notions of unitarity, complete positivity, trace-preservation, non-signalling causality, locality and localizability that are standard in quantum theory be jeopardized as the neighbourhood and partitioning between systems become both quantum, dynamical, and logical. Such interrelations in fact carry through, albeit two new notions become instrumental: consistency and comprehension.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>The expected kinematic matter dipole is robust against source evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements using catalogues of quasars and radio galaxies have shown that the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is about twice as large as is expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, indeed in any cosmology based on the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. This expectation is based on the kinematic interpretation of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background,~i.e. as arising due to our local peculiar velocity. The effect of aberration and Doppler boosting on the projected number counts on the sky of cosmologically distant objects in a flux-limited catalogue can then be calculated and confronted with observations. This fundamental consistency test of FLRW models proposed by Ellis\&amp;Baldwin in 1984 was revisited recently arguing that redshift evolution of the sources can significantly affect the expected matter dipole. In this note we demonstrate that the Ellis\&amp;Baldwin test is in fact robust to such effects, hence the $&gt;5\sigma$ dipole anomaly uncovered recently remains an outstanding challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Testing the standardizability of, and deriving cosmological constraints from, a new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst data compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Warped CFT duals of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski family of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the symmetry properties of the complete family of type D spacetimes generalized form the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution in four dimensions holographically in terms of a warped CFT. The generalized Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions are black hole-like spacetimes characterized by seven physical parameters. Most of the black holes in four dimensions are included within this family. Generically consider a solution with horizon in this family, we figure out the possible warped conformal symmetry attached to the horizon. The horizon can be either extremal or non-extremal. In the extremal case, the near horizon region can be mapped to an infinite spacetime with geometry given by a warped and twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$. The new boundary conditions for AdS$_2$ as well as their higher dimensional uplifts are applied here to manifest the asymptotic symmetry as the warped conformal symmetry. In the non-extremal case, the global warped conformal symmetry is singled out by analyzing the scalar wave equation with constant frequency. The local warped conformal symmetries are represented by the charge algebra associated to the vector fields which preserve the scalar wave equation as well as its frequency. In defining the variation of the covariant charges, a proper counterterm is introduced for consistency conditions which is supposed to be suitable for all the solutions within the family. As a consistency check, the horizon entropy is reproduced by the entropy formula of the warped CFT by using its modular covariance and the central terms derived in the bulk spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The interplay of WGC and WCCC via charged scalar field fluxes in the RPST framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) for the Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N) AdS black hole in a restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST). Also here, we consider energy flux and equivalence mass-energy principle and examine the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. The incoming and outgoing energy flux leads to changes in the black hole. In that case, by applying the first law, we examined whether the second law of thermodynamics is valid. And also one can say that, in the case where absorption and superradiance are in the saturated to an equilibrium. Also, by using the thermodynamics of black holes in the restricted phase space, we show that if the black hole is in an extreme or close to an extreme state with radiation and particle absorption, the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is established. In addition, with the help of equivalence mass and energy principle and second-order approximation, in the near extremity, we find that when the black hole radiates and its central charge is greater than the scaled electric charge, the superradiance particles obey the weak gravity conjecture, and this causes the black hole to move further away from its extreme state. But when the particles that obey the weak gravity conjecture are attracted to the black hole when the black hole is very small. Then, in this case, we note that the black hole becomes closer to its extreme state.</description>

      <title>A new observable for holographic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double-cone geometry is a saddle of the gravitational path integral, which explains the chaotic statistics of the spectrum of black hole microstates. This geometry is the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, but with a periodic identification of the time coordinate; the resulting singularity at the black hole horizon is regulated by making the geometry slightly complex. Here, we consider generalizations of the double-cone geometry which include the Lorentzian cosmology that sits between the event horizon and the black hole singularity. We analyze this in two and three dimensions, where the cosmology has compact spatial sections and big bang/crunch singularities. These singularities are regulated in the same way by slightly complexifying the metric. We show that this is possible while satisfying the Kontsevich-Segal criterion, implying that these geometries can be interpreted as perturbatively stable saddle points in general relativity. This procedure leads to a novel description of the cosmology in terms of standard observables in the dual boundary CFT. In three dimensions, the cosmological solution gives a new contribution to the two-point function of the density of states in the boundary CFT. Unlike the usual double cone, it describes correlations between black hole microstates with different masses, and in a limit describes correlations between the statistics of heavy states and states near the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carrollian field theories have recently emerged as a candidate dual to flat space quantum gravity. We carefully quantize simple two-derivative Carrollian theories, revealing a strong sensitivity to the ultraviolet. They can be regulated upon being placed on a spatial lattice and working at finite inverse temperature. Unlike in conventional field theories, the details of the lattice-regulated Carrollian theories remain important at long distances even in the limit that the lattice spacing is sent to zero. We use that limit to define interacting continuum models with a tractable perturbative expansion. The ensuing theories are those of generalized free fields, with non-Gaussian correlations suppressed by positive powers of the lattice spacing, and an unbroken supertranslation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Gravitational Vector Modes and their Magnetogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>
