      <title>Dynamic Energy-Saving Design for Double-Faced Active RIS Assisted Communications with Perfect/Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paves a new way for next-generation wireless communications, it suffers from inherent flaws, i.e., double-fading attenuation effects and half-space coverage limitations. The state-of-the-art double-face active (DFA)-RIS architecture is proposed for significantly amplifying and transmitting incident signals in full-space. Despite the efficacy of DFA-RIS in mitigating the aforementioned flaws, its potential drawback is that the complex active hardware also incurs intolerable energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, in this paper we propose a novel dynamic energy-saving design for the DFA-RIS, called the sub-array based DFA-RIS architecture. This architecture divides the DFA-RIS into multiple sub-arrays, where the signal amplification function in each sub-array can be activated/deactivated dynamically and flexibly. Utilizing the above architecture, we develop the joint optimization scheme based on transmit beamforming, DFA-RIS configuration, and reflection amplifier (RA) operating pattern to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the DFA-RIS assisted multiuser MISO system considering the perfect/imperfect channel state information (CSI) case. Then, the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and the constrained stochastic majorization-minimization (CSMM) based AO algorithm address non-convex problems in the perfect/imperfect CSI case, respectively. Simulation results verified that our proposed sub-array based DFA-RIS architecture can benefit the EE of the system more than other RIS architectures.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Design for Personalized Federated Multi-Modal Learning over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Multi-Modal Learning (FMML) is an emerging field that integrates information from different modalities in federated learning to improve the learning performance. In this letter, we develop a parameter scheduling scheme to improve personalized performance and communication efficiency in personalized FMML, considering the non-independent and nonidentically distributed (non-IID) data along with the modality heterogeneity. Specifically, a learning-based approach is utilized to obtain the aggregation coefficients for parameters of different modalities on distinct devices. Based on the aggregation coefficients and channel state, a subset of parameters is scheduled to be uploaded to a server for each modality. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the personalized performance of FMML.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Wideband Beam Training Based on Distance-Dependent Beam Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field beam training is essential for acquiring channel state information in 6G extremely large-scale multiple input multiple output (XL-MIMO) systems. To achieve low-overhead beam training, existing method has been proposed to leverage the near-field beam split effect, which deploys true-time-delay arrays to simultaneously search multiple angles of the entire angular range in a distance ring with a single pilot. However, the method still requires exhaustive search in the distance domain, which limits its efficiency. To address the problem, we propose a distance-dependent beam-split-based beam training method to further reduce the training overheads. Specifically, we first reveal the new phenomenon of distance-dependent beam split, where by manipulating the configurations of time-delay and phase-shift, beams at different frequencies can simultaneously scan the angular domain in multiple distance rings. Leveraging the phenomenon, we propose a near-field beam training method where both different angles and distances can simultaneously be searched in one time slot. Thus, a few pilots are capable of covering the whole angle-distance space for wideband XL-MIMO. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the superiority of the proposed method on beamforming gain and training overhead.</description>

      <title>Unlabeled Compressed Sensing from Multiple Measurement Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithmic solution to a broader class of unlabeled sensing problems with multiple measurement vectors (MMV). The goal is to recover an unknown structured signal matrix, $\mathbf{X}$, from its noisy linear observation matrix, $\mathbf{Y}$, whose rows are further randomly shuffled by an unknown permutation matrix $\mathbf{U}$. A new Bayes-optimal unlabeled compressed sensing (UCS) recovery algorithm is developed from the bilinear approximate message passing (Bi-VAMP) framework using non-separable and coupled priors on the rows and columns of the permutation matrix $\mathbf{U}$. In particular, standard unlabeled sensing is a special case of the proposed framework, and UCS further generalizes it by neither assuming a partially shuffled signal matrix $\mathbf{X}$ nor a small-sized permutation matrix $\mathbf{U}$. For the sake of theoretical performance prediction, we also conduct a state evolution (SE) analysis of the proposed algorithm and show its consistency with the asymptotic empirical mean-squared error (MSE). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UCS algorithm and its advantage over state-of-the-art baseline approaches in various applications. We also numerically examine the phase transition diagrams of UCS, thereby characterizing the detectability region as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Joint Multi-User MISO Power Allocation and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks has led to an increased need for wireless resource management solutions that provide higher data rates, wide coverage, low latency, and power efficiency. Yet, many of existing traditional approaches remain non-practical due to computational limitations, and unrealistic presumptions of static network conditions and algorithm initialization dependencies. This creates an important gap between theoretical analysis and real-time processing of algorithms. To bridge this gap, deep learning based techniques offer promising solutions with their representational capabilities for universal function approximation. We propose a novel unsupervised deep learning based joint power allocation and beamforming design for multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system. The objective is to enhance the spectral efficiency by maximizing the sum-rate with the proposed joint design framework, NNBF-P while also offering computationally efficient solution in contrast to conventional approaches. We conduct experiments for diverse settings to compare the performance of NNBF-P with zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF), minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming, and NNBF, which is also our deep learning based beamforming design without joint power allocation scheme. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of NNBF-P compared to ZFBF, and MMSE while NNBF can have lower performances than MMSE and ZFBF in some experiment settings. It can also demonstrate the effectiveness of joint design framework with respect to NNBF.</description>

      <title>A Unified Pilot Design for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a unified pilot signal design in an orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system. The novel designed two-dimensional (2D) pilot signal is generated on the delay-Doppler (DD) plane for sensing, while its time-frequency (TF) plane transformation acts as the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) for the OFDM data. The well-designed pilot signal preserves orthogonality with the data in terms of resource occupancy in the TF plane and quasi-orthogonality in terms of codeword in the DD plane. Leveraging these nice properties, we are allowed to implement sensing detection in the DD plane using a simple 2D correlation, taking advantage of the favorable auto-correlation properties of the 2D pilot. In the communication part, the transformed pilot in the TF plane serves as a known DMRS for channel estimation and equalization. The 2D pilot design demonstrates good scalability and can adapt to different delay and Doppler resolution requirements without violating the OFDM data detection and can overcome the fractional Doppler with limited sensing resources. Experimental results show the effective sensing performance of the proposed pilot, with only a small fraction of power shared from the OFDM data,while maintaining satisfactory symbol detection performance in communication.</description>

      <title>Minimal Communication-Cost Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A client device which has access to $n$ training data samples needs to obtain a statistical hypothesis or model $W$ and then to send it to a remote server. The client and the server devices share some common randomness sequence as well as a prior on the hypothesis space. In this problem a suitable hypothesis or model $W$ should meet two distinct design criteria simultaneously: (i) small (population) risk during the inference phase and (ii) small 'complexity' for it to be conveyed to the server with minimum communication cost. In this paper, we propose a joint training and source coding scheme with provable in-expectation guarantees, where the expectation is over the encoder's output message. Specifically, we show that by imposing a constraint on a suitable Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditional distribution induced by a compressed learning model $\widehat{W}$ given $W$ and the prior, one guarantees simultaneously small average empirical risk (aka training loss), small average generalization error and small average communication cost. We also consider a one-shot scenario in which the guarantees on the empirical risk and generalization error are obtained for every encoder's output message.</description>

      <title>Interference Mitigation using Optimized Angle Diversity Receiver in LiFi Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-fidelity (LiFi) is an emerging technology for high-speed short-range mobile communications. Inter-cell interference (ICI) is an important issue that limits the system performance in an optical attocell network. Angle diversity receivers (ADRs) have been proposed to mitigate ICI. In this paper, the structure of pyramid receivers (PRs) and truncated pyramid receivers (TPRs) are studied. The coverage problems of PRs and TPRs are defined and investigated, and the lower bound of field of view (FOV) for each PD is given analytically. The impact of random device orientation and diffuse link signal propagation are taken into consideration. The performances of PRs and TPRs are compared and then optimized ADR structures are proposed. The performance comparison between the select best combining (SBC) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) is given under different noise levels. It is shown that SBC will outperform MRC in an interference limited system, otherwise, MRC is a preferred scheme. In addition, the double source system, where each LiFi AP consists of two sources transmitting the same information signals but with opposite polarity, is proved to outperform the single source (SS) system under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Storage codes on coset graphs with asymptotically unit rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A storage code on a graph $G$ is a set of assignments of symbols to the vertices such that every vertex can recover its value by looking at its neighbors. We consider the question of constructing large-size storage codes on triangle-free graphs constructed as coset graphs of binary linear codes. Previously it was shown that there are infinite families of binary storage codes on coset graphs with rate converging to 3/4. Here we show that codes on such graphs can attain rate asymptotically approaching 1. Equivalently, this question can be phrased as a version of hat-guessing games on graphs (e.g., P.J. Cameron e.a., \emph{Electronic J. Comb.} 2016). In this language, we construct triangle-free graphs with success probability of the players approaching one as the number of vertices tends to infinity. Furthermore, finding linear index codes of rate approaching zero is also an equivalent problem. Another family of storage codes on triangle-free graphs of rate approaching 1 was constructed earlier by A. Golovnev and I. Haviv (36th Computational Complexity Conf., 2021) relying on a different family of graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved Energy-Based Signal Detection for Ambient Backscatter Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems, passive tags connect to a reader by reflecting an ambient radio frequency (RF) signal. However, the reader may not know the channel states and RF source parameters. The traditional energy detector (TED) appears to be an ideal solution. However, it performs poorly under these conditions. To address this, we propose two new detectors: (1) A joint correlation-energy detector (JCED) based on the first-order correlation of the received samples and (2) An improved energy detector (IED) based on the p-th norm of the received signal vector. We compare the performance of IED and TED under the generalized noise model using McLeish distribution and derive a general analytical formula for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Based on our results, both detectors outperform TED. For example, the probability of detection with a false alarm rate of 1\% for JCED and IED is 22.97\% and 5.41\% higher, respectively, compared to TED for a single-antenna reader. Using the direct interference cancellation (DIC) technique, these gains are 34.92\% and 3.7\%, respectively. With a four-antenna array at the reader and a 5\% false alarm rate, the JCED shows a significant BER improvement of 28.68\% without DIC and 48.21\% with DIC.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Superposition Coded Modulation for Hierarchical Semantic Communications over Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multi-user semantic communications over broadcast channels. While most existing works consider that each receiver requires either the same or independent semantic information, this paper explores the scenario where the semantic information desired by different receivers is different but correlated. In particular, we investigate semantic communications over Gaussian broadcast channels where the transmitter has a common observable source but the receivers wish to recover hierarchical semantic information in adaptation to their channel conditions. Inspired by the capacity achieving property of superposition codes, we propose a deep learning based superposition coded modulation (DeepSCM) scheme. Specifically, the hierarchical semantic information is first extracted and encoded into basic and enhanced feature vectors. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then developed to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is uncorrelated with the basic features. Finally, the basic features and their refinement are superposed for broadcasting after probabilistic modulation. Experiments are conducted for two-receiver image semantic broadcasting with coarse and fine classification as hierarchical semantic tasks. DeepSCM outperforms the benchmarking coded-modulation scheme without a superposition structure, especially with large channel disparity and high order modulation. It also approaches the performance upperbound as if there were only one receiver.</description>

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic lower bound for the problem of parameter estimation with time-uniform coverage guarantees. Via a new a reduction to sequential testing, we obtain stronger lower bounds that capture the hardness of the time-uniform setting. In the case of location model estimation, logistic regression, and exponential family models, our $\Omega(\sqrt{n^{-1}\log \log n})$ lower bound is sharp to within constant factors in typical settings.</description>

      <title>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for the oil and gas industry: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is set to profoundly impact the oil and gas industry by introducing unprecedented efficiencies and innovations. This paper explores AGI's foundational principles and its transformative applications, particularly focusing on the advancements brought about by large language models (LLMs) and extensive computer vision systems in the upstream sectors of the industry. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already begun reshaping the oil and gas landscape, offering enhancements in production optimization, downtime reduction, safety improvements, and advancements in exploration and drilling techniques. These technologies streamline logistics, minimize maintenance costs, automate monotonous tasks, refine decision-making processes, foster team collaboration, and amplify profitability through error reduction and actionable insights extraction. Despite these advancements, the deployment of AI technologies faces challenges, including the necessity for skilled professionals for implementation and the limitations of model training on constrained datasets, which affects the models' adaptability across different contexts. The advent of generative AI, exemplified by innovations like ChatGPT and the Segment Anything Model (SAM), heralds a new era of high-density innovation. These developments highlight a shift towards natural language interfaces and domain-knowledge-driven AI, promising more accessible and tailored solutions for the oil and gas industry. This review articulates the vast potential AGI holds for tackling complex operational challenges within the upstream oil and gas industry, requiring near-human levels of intelligence. We discussed the promising applications, the hurdles of large-scale AGI model deployment, and the necessity for domain-specific knowledge in maximizing the benefits of these technologies.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of Reed-Solomon Codes and Random Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the list-decodability and list-recoverability of two code ensembles: random linear codes and random Reed-Solomon codes. Inspired by the existing research about local properties of random code ensembles over small alphabets, we develop a new framework to study a similar family of properties over larger alphabets, such as in the case of Reed-Solomon codes. We introduce the notion of local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, which encompasses various natural properties including list-decodability and list-recoverability.
  Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we establish a threshold theorem for LCL properties of random linear codes, identifying a critical rate below which these codes almost surely satisfy a given property and above which they almost surely do not; (2) we use this framework to prove that random linear codes are essentially optimally list-decodable and list-recoverable in the large alphabet regime; and (3) we demonstrate a reduction from random linear codes to random Reed-Solomon codes, showing that Reed-Solomon codes inherit the LCL properties of linear codes with similar rates. We conclude that random Reed-Solomon codes, with alphabet size that may be as small as linear in the code length, are also optimally list-decodable and list-recoverable.
  For list-recovery, our results about both ensembles constitute a significant leap from the best previously known bounds. For list-decodability, we recover recent theorems via a more direct approach, avoiding reliance on complex external results.</description>

Abstract: Assume that an interferer behaves according to a parametric model but one does not know the value of the model parameters. Sensing enables to improve the model knowledge and therefore perform a better link adaptation. However, we consider a half-duplex scenario where, at each time slot, the communication system should decide between sensing and communication. We thus propose to investigate the optimal policy to maximize the expected sum rate given a finite-time communication. % the following question therefore arises: At a given time slot, should one sense or communicate? We first show that this problem can be modelled in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We then demonstrate that the optimal open-loop and closed-loop policies can be found significantly faster than the standard backward-induction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum cyclic redundancy check codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that certain classical cyclic redundancy check codes can be used for classical error correction and not just classical error detection. We extend the idea of classical cyclic redundancy check codes to quantum cyclic redundancy check codes. This allows us to construct quantum stabiliser codes which can correct burst errors where the burst length attains the quantum Reiger bound. We then consider a certain family of quantum cyclic redundancy check codes for which we present a fast linear time decoding algorithm.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Submodular Information Measures for Targeted Data Subset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increasing volume of data being used across machine learning tasks, the capability to target specific subsets of data becomes more important. To aid in this capability, the recently proposed Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) has been effectively applied across numerous tasks in literature to perform targeted subset selection with the aid of a exemplar query set. However, all such works are deficient in providing theoretical guarantees for SMI in terms of its sensitivity to a subset's relevance and coverage of the targeted data. For the first time, we provide such guarantees by deriving similarity-based bounds on quantities related to relevance and coverage of the targeted data. With these bounds, we show that the SMI functions, which have empirically shown success in multiple applications, are theoretically sound in achieving good query relevance and query coverage.</description>

      <title>BCAmirs at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Beyond Words: A Multimodal and Multilingual Exploration of Persuasion in Memes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memes, combining text and images, frequently use metaphors to convey persuasive messages, shaping public opinion. Motivated by this, our team engaged in SemEval-2024 Task 4, a hierarchical multi-label classification task designed to identify rhetorical and psychological persuasion techniques embedded within memes. To tackle this problem, we introduced a caption generation step to assess the modality gap and the impact of additional semantic information from images, which improved our result. Our best model utilizes GPT-4 generated captions alongside meme text to fine-tune RoBERTa as the text encoder and CLIP as the image encoder. It outperforms the baseline by a large margin in all 12 subtasks. In particular, it ranked in top-3 across all languages in Subtask 2a, and top-4 in Subtask 2b, demonstrating quantitatively strong performance. The improvement achieved by the introduced intermediate step is likely attributable to the metaphorical essence of images that challenges visual encoders. This highlights the potential for improving abstract visual semantics encoding.</description>

      <title>Co-learning-aided Multi-modal-deep-learning Framework of Passive DOA Estimators for a Heterogeneous Hybrid Massive MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to its excellent performance in rate and resolution, fully-digital (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays has been widely applied in data transmission and direction of arrival (DOA) measurements, etc. But it confronts with two main challenges: high computational complexity and circuit cost. The two problems may be addressed well by hybrid analog-digital (HAD) structure. But there exists the problem of phase ambiguity for HAD, which leads to its low-efficiency or high-latency. Does exist there such a MIMO structure of owning low-cost, low-complexity and high time efficiency at the same time. To satisfy the three properties, a novel heterogeneous hybrid MIMO receiver structure of integrating FD and heterogeneous HAD ($\rm{H}^2$AD-FD) is proposed and corresponding multi-modal (MD)-learning framework is developed. The framework includes three major stages: 1) generate the candidate sets via root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC) or deep learning (DL); 2) infer the class of true solutions from candidate sets using machine learning (ML) methods; 3) fuse the two-part true solutions to achieve a better DOA estimation. The above process form two methods named MD-Root-MUSIC and MDDL. To improve DOA estimation accuracy and reduce the clustering complexity, a co-learning-aided MD framework is proposed to form two enhanced methods named CoMDDL and CoMD-RootMUSIC. Moreover, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the proposed $\rm{H}^2$AD-FD structure is also derived. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed four methods could approach the CRLB for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &gt; 0 dB and the proposed CoMDDL and MDDL perform better than CoMD-RootMUSIC and MD-RootMUSIC, particularly in the extremely low SNR region.</description>
