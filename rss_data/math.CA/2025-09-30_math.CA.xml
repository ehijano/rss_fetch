      <title>Time-frequency representations on Lorentz spaces over locally compact Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact Abelian group with a fixed Haar measure and, denote by $\widehat{G}$ its dual group. In this article, the authors obtain various boundedness of the short-time Fourier transform on Lorentz spaces: $$L^{p_1,u}(G)\times L^{p_2,v}(G)\to L^{q,w}(G\times\widehat{G})$$ with the indexes satisfying appropriate relations. These results are then used to prove the corresponding boundedness of $\tau$-Wigner transforms and $\tau$-Weyl operators. As an application, the Lieb's uncertainty principle in the context of Lorentz spaces is finally investigated. All these results are new even for the case when $G$ is finite.</description>

      <title>Spectrality of Prime Size Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23752v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a tile in $\mathbb Z^d$ has prime size $p$, then it must be spectral. The proof is by contradiction, it is simply shown that the tiling complement of such a tile can not annihilate all $p$-subgroups. In addition, with a simple transformation we prove that any $p$ points in general linear positions in $\mathbb Z^d$ must be both tiling and spectral if $d\ge p-1$.</description>

      <title>Capacitary Muckenhoupt Weights and Weighted Norm Inequalities for Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal H_{\infty}^\delta$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in(0,n]$ defined on subsets of $\mathbb R^n$. The principal problem, considered in this paper, is to characterize the non-negative function $w$ for which the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality on Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators associated with Hausdorff contents hold true. To achieve this, we introduce a class of capacitary Muckenhoupt weights depending on the dimension $\delta$, denoted as $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, which enjoys the strict monotonicity on the dimension index $\delta$. Then we show that, for any $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$, the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{1,\delta}$ by a new approach developed in this paper. As the second objective, applying this new approach, the seminal properties of classical Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights, such as the reverse H\"older inequality (R. R. Coifman and C. Fefferman, Studia Math. 51 (1974), 241-250), the self-improving property (B. Muckenhoupt, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 165 (1972), 207-226), and the Jones factorization theorem (P. W. Jones, Ann. of Math. (2) 111 (1980), 511-530), are all established within the framework of capacitary Muckenhoupt weight class $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$. Finally, we also show that the maximal operator is bounded on the weak weighted Choquet-Lebesgue space $L_w^{p,\infty}(\mathbb R^n,{\mathcal H}_\infty^\delta)$ if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$ with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$.</description>

      <title>Progress in Projection Theory and other dimensional developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide exposition into the field of projection theory, which lies at the intersection of incidence geometry and geometric measure theory. We first give the necessary preliminaries in Chapter 2, focusing on incidences between points and lines and the definition of Hausdorff dimension. With this background in tow, in Chapter 3 we dive into thorough surveys on three topics in projection theory: orthogonal projections, Furstenberg sets, and radial projections. We particularly highlight the interconnectedness of these topics in both the discrete and continuum settings. Through these surveys, we also give the necessary background for discussing applications of projection theory in Chapter 4.
  The first application is on Beck-type problems, first studied in the discrete setting by J\'ozsef Beck in 1983 and in the continuum setting by Orponen, Shmerkin, and Wang in 2022. Given $X\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, these problems seek to understand how large the set of lines that contain at least 2 points of $X$, $\mathcal L(X)$, can be. To this end, we present a continuum Erd\H{o}s--Beck theorem due to myself and Marshall in 2024, which motivates and makes use of a dual Furstenberg set estimate due to myself, Fu, and Ren from the same year.
  The second application is on Falconer-type (distance) problems which have been a prominent topic in both the discrete and continuum settings. Given $X\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, these problems seek to understand how large $X$ must be until the set of distinct "distances" between points of $X$ is large (for a reasonable notion of "distance"). To this end, we present a Falconer-type distance problem for dot products due to myself, Marshall, and Senger in 2024, making use of both standard and modern results for orthogonal and radial projections.</description>

      <title>Domains with globally exponentially integrable parabolic forward-in-time BMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize those open sets of the space time in which parabolic forward-in-time BMO functions are in a certain forward-in-time exponential integrability class. The characterization holds under qualitative connectivity assumptions on the domain and is formulated in terms of a quantitative growth bound on a forward-in-time version of the classical quasihyperbolic distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a simple approach to proving the interlacing properties of positive zeros of Bessel functions of the first kind. The approach relies only on the standard recurrence relations between Bessel functions and characterising intersections between curves, providing a more accessible and intuitive understanding for the interlacing behaviour of the zeros of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Robin Problems of Elliptic Equations on Rough Domains: H\"older Regularity, Green's Functions, and Harmonic Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 2$ and $s\in (n-2,n)$. Assume that $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a one-sided bounded non-tangentially accessible domain with $s$-Ahlfors regular boundary and $\sigma$ is the surface measure on the boundary of $\Omega$, denoted by $\partial \Omega$. Let $\beta$ be a non-negative measurable function on $\partial \Omega$ satisfying $\beta\in L^{q_0}(\partial \Omega,\sigma)~\text{with}~ q_0 \in(\frac{s}{s+2-n},\infty]~\text{and}\ \beta\ge a_0~\text{on}~E_0\subset \partial \Omega, $ where $a_0$ is a given positive constant and $E_0\subset \partial \Omega$ is a $\sigma$-measurable set with $\sigma(E_0)&gt;0$. In this article, for any $f\in L^p(\partial \Omega,\sigma)$ with $p\in(s/(s+2-n),\infty]$, we obtain the existence and uniqueness, the global H\"older regularity, and the boundary Harnack inequality of the weak solution to the Robin problem $$\begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u) = 0~~&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ A\nabla u\cdot \boldsymbol{\nu}+\beta u = f~~&amp;\text{on}~\partial \Omega, \end{cases} $$ where the coefficient matrix $A$ is real-valued, bounded and measurable and satisfies the uniform ellipticity condition and where $\boldsymbol{\nu}$ denotes the outward unit normal to $\partial\Omega$. Furthermore, we establish the existence, upper bound pointwise estimates, and the H\"older regularity of Green's functions associated with this Robin problem. As applications, we further prove that the harmonic measure associated with this Robin problem is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to the surface measure $\sigma$ and also provide a quantitative characterization of mutual absolute continuity at small scales. These results extend the corresponding results established by David et al. [arXiv: 2410.23914] via weakening their assumption that $\beta$ is a given positive constant.</description>

      <title>Controlled rough paths: a general Hopf-algebraic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up controlled rough paths for a class of combinatorial Hopf algebras, encompassing shuffle, Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and Munthe-Kaas--Wright Hopf algebras. The class of controls we consider encompasses both H\"older continuous paths and (not necessarily continuous) paths with bounded $p$-variation. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution of a lifted initial value problem in this general setting by applying the fixed point method in a suitable Banach space of controlled rough paths, and we prove a universal limit theorem addressing the robustness of the solution with respect to the parameters and the initial condition.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova Formula in (Fractional) Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, of nonlocal functionals $$ \mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u) = \iint_{\mathbb{R}^N\times\mathbb{R}^N}
  \rho_{\varepsilon}(y-x)\,|u(x)-u(y)|^p\,dx\,dy,\qquad u\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^N),\quad 1\leqslant p&lt;\infty, $$ associated with a general family of nonnegative measurable kernels $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$. Our primary aim is to single out the weakest moment-type assumptions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$ that are necessary and sufficient for the pointwise convergence $$ \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u)=2\|u\|_{L^p}^p $$ to hold for every $u$ in a prescribed subspace of $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$. In the canonical smooth regime of compactly supported functions ($u\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$) we show that convergence occurs when two optimal conditions are satisfied: (i) a mass-escape condition, and (ii) a short-range attenuation effect, expressed by the vanishing as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the kernels' $p$-moments in any fixed neighborhood of the origin. This general framework recovers the classical Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova theorem for fractional-type kernels and extends the convergence result to a much broader class of interaction profiles, which may be non-symmetric and non-homogeneous. Using a density argument that preserves the moment assumptions, we prove that the same necessary and sufficient conditions remain valid in the integer-order Sobolev setting ($u\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$). Finally, by adapting the method to fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $s\in(0,1)$, we recover the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova formula and extend it under analogous abstract conditions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure of stationary problem for spatial 1D self-diffusion equation with logistic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the solution structure of non-trivial, non-constant stationary states of 1D spatial parabolic equations with nonlinear self-diffusion and logistic growth terms. A two-dimensional ordinary differential equation satisfying the stationary problem is derived and all its dynamics, including to infinity, is revealed by the Poincar\'e-Lyapunov compactification, one of the compactifications of phase space. The advantage of this method is that it can be used to classify all dynamical systems (especially connecting orbits) of a two-dimensional system including infinity. Therefore, the classification results for the dynamical system including to infinity give the classification results for the non-constant stationary states obtained only from the structure of the original equations. This argument allows us to observe a change in the classification of the non-constant stationary states by an explicit relation between the linear diffusion coefficient and the self-diffusion coefficient, combined with arguments about the symmetries and conserved quantities of the ODEs. This means that changing the self-diffusion coefficient as a bifurcation parameter not only qualitatively changes the dynamical system from a big saddle homoclinic orbit of the ODEs to a heteroclinic orbit that connects the saddle equilibria, but also significantly changes the shape and the properties of the stationary states. It explicitly shows the relationship between linear and self-diffusion, gives a characterization of non-trivial stationary states in terms of dynamical systems, and gives a deep insight into the influence of self-diffusion, one of the nonlinear diffusions.</description>

      <title>New nonabelian Hodge graphs from twisted irregular connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that any meromorphic connection on the Riemann sphere determines a finite diagram encoding its global Cartan matrix, and that it is invariant under the Fourier-Laplace transform. If the connection is tame at finite distance and untwisted at infinity, the diagram is actually a graph, corresponding to a symmetric generalised Cartan matrix, and it was proved by Boalch/Hiroe-Yamakawa that the corresponding nonabelian Hodge moduli space contains the Nakajima quiver variety of the graph as an open subset. In this note, we show that there exist new nonabelian Hodge diagrams that are graphs, beyond the setting of this quiver modularity theorem. The proof relies on observing that edge multiplicities in nonabelian Hodge diagrams satisfy ultrametric inequalities, which in particular gives a precise characterisation of nonabelian Hodge graphs coming from the untwisted setting.</description>

Abstract: Answering a question of Michael Bleicher and Paul Erd\H{o}s, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rationals infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</description>

      <title>Concerning the stability of exponential systems and Fourier matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier matrices naturally appear in many applications and their stability is closely tied to performance guarantees of algorithms. The starting point of this article is a result that characterizes properties of an exponential system on a union of cubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in terms of a general class of Fourier matrices and their extreme singular values. This relationship is flexible in the sense that it holds for any dimension $d$, for many types of exponential systems (Riesz bases, Riesz sequences, or frames) and for Fourier matrices with an arbitrary number of rows and columns. From there, we prove new stability results for Fourier matrices by exploiting this connection and using powerful stability theorems for exponential systems. This paper provides a systematic exploration of this connection and suggests some natural open questions.</description>

      <title>Furstenberg set problem and exceptional set estimate in prime fields: dimension two implies higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study in prime fields the exceptional set estimates, which can be viewed as a refinement of Marstrand's orthogonal projection theorem. Additionally, we address a Furstenberg-type problem, which is closely related. It is shown that the two-dimensional result implies all higher-dimensional results in the prime-field setting.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials on multiple intervals with non-analytic weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials for measures that are differentiable, but not necessarily analytic, multiplicative perturbations of Jacobi-like measures supported on disjoint intervals. We analyze the Fokas--Its--Kitaev Riemann--Hilbert problem using the Deift--Zhou method of nonlinear steepest descent and its $\bar \partial$ extension due to Miller and McLaughlin. Our results extend that of Yattselev in the case of Chebyshev-like measures with error bounds that give similar rates while allowing less regular perturbations. For the general Jacobi-like case, we present, what appears to be the first result for asymptotics when the perturbation of the measure is only assumed to be differentiable with bounded second derivative.</description>

      <title>Weak $(1,1)$ estimate for maximal truncated rough singular integral operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal work (Amer. J. Math. 78: 289-309, 1956), Calder\'on and Zygmund introduced the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator and established its $L^p$-boundedness for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. However, the endpoint case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type $(1,1)$.</description>

      <title>Speed of propagation of fractional dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that all non-trivial solutions of a broad class of nonlinear dispersive equations, whose linear evolution is governed by a dispersion relation under minimal regularity assumptions, cannot remain compactly supported for any non-trivial time interval. Our approach, based on complex-analytic arguments and the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem, yields a stronger result: if linear solutions are compactly supported at two distinct times, then the dispersion relation must admit an analytic extension. This extends previous results beyond polynomial dispersion relations and applies to more general settings, including fractional-order systems. As an application, we examine the generalized space-time fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation, illustrating the role of memory effects in wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Linear relations between $L$-values of newforms and moments of elliptic $K$ integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By systematically translating certain integrals involving moments of the elliptic integral into $L$-values of modular forms on $\Gamma_1(4), \Gamma(4)$ and $\Gamma_1(8)$, and then utilizing relations among the critical $L$-values of cuspidal newforms, we obtain a dimension formula for the space spanned by these integrals.</description>
