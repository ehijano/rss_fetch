      <title>The Non-Commutative Brillouin Torus, a Non-Commutative Geometry perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08757v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-commutative geometry has significantly contributed to quantum mechanics by providing mathematical tools to extract topological and geometrical information from these systems. This thesis explores the methods used by Jean Bellissard and collaborators for analyzing homogeneous materials. The focus is on two topological algebras that extend Fourier analysis over $\mathbb{T}^d$ to study tight-binding models for homogeneous materials. These algebras, generalizations of $C(\mathbb{T}^d)$ and $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}^d)$, are considered anon-commutative smooth manifold, referred to as the Non-Commutative Brillouin Torus. Techniques from Fourier analysis, such as Fourier coefficients and Fej\'er summation, are adapted to this context, capturing the topological and smooth structure of the non-commutative manifold. The topological structure is represented by a C* algebra, while the smooth structure is captured by a smooth sub-algebra, forming the basis for constructing topological invariants of Hamiltonians through continuous cyclic cohomology.
  Additionally, the K theory of C* algebras and smooth sub-algebras is a crucial tool for studying topological invariants of Hamiltonians. Smooth sub-algebras share a functional calculus with C* algebras, providing sufficient information to study their K theory. This relationship is vital for identifying topological invariants of Hamiltonians, particularly under conditions like low temperature and electron density, which contribute to the quantization of transversal conductivity in homogeneous materials. This thesis aims to be a valuable resource for newcomers to the field.</description>

      <title>Energy and entropy conserving compatible finite elements with upwinding for the thermal shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new compatible finite element formulation of the thermal shallow water equations that conserves energy and mathematical entropies given by buoyancy-related quadratic tracer variances. Our approach relies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time integration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The proposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes, monotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The fully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level. The ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and upwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally unstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different transient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability where including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy. The second is a double vortex where a constrained fully discrete formulation is shown to achieve exact entropy conservation in time.</description>

      <title>Jacobi convolution polynomial for Petrov-Galerkin scheme and general fractional calculus of arbitrary order over finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, general fractional calculus was introduced by Kochubei (2011) and Luchko (2021) as a further generalisation of fractional calculus, where the derivative and integral operator admits arbitrary kernel. Such a formalism will have many applications in physics and engineering, since the kernel is no longer restricted. We first extend the work of Al-Refai and Luchko (2023) on finite interval to arbitrary orders. Followed by, developing an efficient Petrov-Galerkin scheme by introducing Jacobi convolution polynomials as basis functions. A notable property of this basis function, the general fractional derivative of Jacobi convolution polynomial is a shifted Jacobi polynomial. Thus, with a suitable test function it results in diagonal stiffness matrix, hence, the efficiency in implementation. Furthermore, our method is constructed for any arbitrary kernel including that of fractional operator, since, its a special case of general fractional operator.</description>

      <title>An age-structured diffusive model for epidemic modelling: Lie symmetries and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new age-structured diffusive model for the mathematical modelling of epidemics is suggested. The model can be considered as a generalization of two models suggested earlier for the same purposes. The Lie symmetry classification of the model is derived. It is shown that the model admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of invariance. Using the Lie symmetries, exact solutions, in particular those of the travelling wave types and in terms of special functions, are constructed. An example of application of the correctly-specified exact solution for calculation of total numbers of infected individuals during an epidemic is presented.</description>

      <title>From $G_2$ to $SO(8)$: Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</description>

      <title>Characterising memory in quantum channel discrimination via constrained separability problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are a crucial precondition in many protocols for processing quantum information. A fundamental problem that illustrates this statement is given by the task of channel discrimination, in which an unknown channel drawn from a known random ensemble should be determined by applying it for a single time. In this paper, we characterise the quality of channel discrimination protocols when the quantum memory, quantified by the auxiliary dimension, is limited. This is achieved by formulating the problem in terms of separable quantum states with additional affine constraints that all of their factors in each separable decomposition obey. We discuss the computation of upper and lower bounds to the solutions of such problems which allow for new insights into the role of memory in channel discrimination. In addition to the single-copy scenario, this methodological insight allows to systematically characterise quantum and classical memories in adaptive channel discrimination protocols. Especially, our methods enabled us to identify channel discrimination scenarios where classical or quantum memory is required, and to identify the hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships within adaptive channel discrimination protocols.</description>

      <title>On some states minimizing uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg-Robertson (HR) and Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of product of the standard deviations of a pair of non-commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. We have also shown that the so-called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states.</description>

      <title>On sampling two spin models using the local connective constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes novel, optimum mixing bounds for the Glauber dynamics on the Hard-core and Ising models using the powerful Spectral Independence method from [Anari, Liu, Oveis-Gharan: FOCS 2020]. These bounds are expressed in terms of the local connective constant of the underlying graph $G$. This is a notion of effective degree of $G$ on a local scale.
  Our results have some interesting consequences for bounded degree graphs:
  (a) They include the max-degree bounds as a special case,
  (b) They improve on the running time of the FPTAS considered in [Sinclair, Srivastava, Stefankonic and Yin: PTRF 2017],
  (c) They allow us to obtain mixing bounds in terms of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix and improve on results in [Hayes: FOCS 2006],
  (d) They also allow us to refine the celebrated connection between the hardness of approximate counting and the phase transitions from statistical physics.
  We obtain our mixing bounds by utilising the $k$-non-backtracking matrix $H_{G,k}$. This is a very interesting, alas technically intricate, object to work with. We upper bound the spectral radius of the pairwise influence matrix $I^{\Lambda,\tau}_{G}$ by means of the 2-norm of $H_{G,k}$. To our knowledge, obtaining mixing bound using $H_{G,k}$ has not been considered before in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the inadequacy of nudging data assimilation algorithms for non-dissipative systems: A computational examination of the Korteweg de-Vries and Lorenz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the applicability of the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) nudging algorithm for continuous data assimilation to evolutionary dynamical systems that are not dissipative. Specifically, we apply the AOT algorithm to the Korteweg de-Vries (KdV) equation and a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system. Our analysis reveals that the KdV equation lacks the finitely many determining modes property, leading to the construction of infinitely many solutions with exactly the same sparse observational data, which data assimilation methods cannot distinguish between. We numerically verify that the AOT algorithm successfully recovers these counterexamples for the damped and driven KdV equation, as studied in [1], which is dissipative. Additionally, we demonstrate numerically that the AOT algorithm is not effective in accurately recovering solutions for a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By decoupling forward and backward stochastic trajectories, we develop a family of martingales and work theorems for the same stochastic process. We achieve this by introducing an alternative work theorem derivation that uses tools from stochastic calculus instead of path integrals. Our derivation applies to both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics and generalizes work theorems so that they connect new quantities in stochastic processes, potentially revealing new applications in dissipative systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of a single impurity particle embedded within a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP). By analyzing the impurity's dynamics, characterized by two arbitrary hopping parameters $ \alpha $ and $\beta$, we investigate both its macroscopic impact on the system and its individual trajectory, providing new insights into the interaction between the impurity and the TASEP environment. We classify the induced hydrodynamic limit shapes based on the initial densities to the left and right of the impurity, along with the values of the parameters $\alpha$,$\beta$. We develop a new method that enables the analysis of the impurity's behavior within an arbitrary density field, thereby generalizing the traditional coupling technique used for second-class particles. With this tool, we extend to the impurity case under certain parameter conditions, Ferrari and Kipnis's results on the distribution of the asymptotic speed of a second-class particle within a rarefaction fan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory aims to find an optimal protocol to steer a system between assigned boundary conditions while minimizing a given cost functional in finite time. Equations arising from these types of problems are often non-linear and difficult to solve numerically. In this note, we describe numerical methods of integration for two partial differential equations that commonly arise in optimal control theory: the Fokker-Planck equation driven by a mechanical potential for which we use Girsanov theorem; and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman, or dynamic programming, equation for which we find the gradient of its solution using the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application in solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization by machine learning.</description>

      <title>Conditional expectations in Quantum Mechanics and causal interpretations: the Bohm momentum as a best predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a normalized state-vector $\psi $, we define the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E }_{\psi } (A | B ) $ of a Hermitian operator $A $ with respect to a strongly commuting family of self-adjoint operators $B $ as the best approximation, in the operator mean square norm associated to $\psi $, of $A $ by a real-valued function of $B . $ A fundamental example is the conditional expectation of the momentum operator $P $ given the position operator $X $, which is found to be the Bohm momentum. After developing the Bohm theory from this point of view we treat conditional expectations with respect to general $B $, which we apply to non-relativistic spin 1/2-particles. We derive the dynamics of the conditional expectations of momentum and spin with respect to position and the third spin component. These dynamics can be interpreted in terms of classical continuum mechanics as a two-component fluid whose components carry intrinsic angular momentum. Interpreting the joint spectrum of the conditioning operators as a space of beables, we can introduce a classical-stochastic particle dynamics on this space which is compatible with the time-evolution of the Born probability, by combining the de Broglie-Bohm guidance condition with a Markov jump process, following an idea of J. Bell. This results in a new Bohm-type model for particles with spin. A basic problem is that such auxiliary particle dynamics are far from unique.
  We finally examine the relation of our conditional expectations with the conditional expectations of the theory of $C^* $-algebras and, as an application, derive a general evolution equation for conditional expectations for operators acting on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Two appendices re-interpret the classical Bohm model as an integrable constrained Hamiltonian system, and provide the details of the two-fluid interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present perturbative error bounds for the non-Markovian dynamics of observables in open quantum systems interacting with Gaussian environments, governed by general Liouville dynamics. This extends the work of [Mascherpa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 100401, 2017], which demonstrated qualitatively tighter bounds over the standard Gr\"onwall-type analysis, where the joint system-environment evolution is unitary. Our results apply to systems with both bosonic and fermionic environments. Our approach utilizes a superoperator formalism, which avoids the need for formal coherent state path integral calculations, or the dilation of Lindblad dynamics into an equivalent unitary framework with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This enables a unified treatment of a wide range of open quantum systems. These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for various recently developed pseudomode methods in simulating open quantum system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of breathers for coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral stability of non-degenerate vector soliton solutions and the nonlinear stability of breather solutions for the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger (CNLS) equations. The non-degenerate vector solitons are spectrally stable despite the linearized operator admits either embedded or isolated eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. The nonlinear stability of breathers is obtained by the Lyapunov method with the help of the squared eigenfunctions due to integrability of the CNLS equations.</description>

      <title>Rational solutions of Painlev\'e V from Hankel determinants and the asymptotics of their pole locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the poles of certain rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'e equation. These solutions are constructed by relating the corresponding tau function with a Hankel determinant of a certain sequence of moments. This approach was also used by one of the authors and collaborators in the study of the rational solutions of the second Painlev\'e equation. More specifically we study the roots of the corresponding polynomial tau function, whose location corresponds to the poles of the associated rational solution. We show that, upon suitable rescaling, the roots fill a well-defined region bounded by analytic arcs when the degree of the polynomial tau function tends to infinity. Moreover we provide an approximate location of these roots within the region in terms of suitable quantization conditions.</description>

Abstract: We define a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued index for stably short-range entangled states of two-dimensional fermionic lattice systems with charge conservation and time reversal symmetry. The index takes its non-trivial value precisely if the `fluxon', the state obtained by inserting a $\pi$-flux through the system, transforms under time reversal as part of a Kramers pair. This index extends the Fu-Kane-Mele index of free fermionic topological insulators to interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Hall conductance and its non-abelian and higher-dimensional analogs are obstructions to promoting a symmetry of a state to a gauge symmetry. To do this, we define a local Lie algebra over a Grothendieck site as a pre-cosheaf of Lie algebras with additional properties and propose that a gauge symmetry should be described by such an object. We show that infinitesimal symmetries of a gapped state of a quantum spin system form a local Lie algebra over a site of semilinear sets and use it to construct topological invariants of the state. Our construction applies to lattice systems on arbitrary asymptotically conical subsets of a Euclidean space including those which cannot be studied using field theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation is not frequently used in the framework of the classical mechanics, though historically this equation was derived as a simplified equation, which is equivalent to the classical Germain-Lagrange dynamic plate equation. The question concerning the exact meaning of this equivalence is still discussed in modern literature. In this note, we consider the one-dimensional case, where the Germain-Lagrange equation reduces to the Euler-Bernoulli equation, which is used in the classical theory of a beam. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all solutions (i.e., wave functions $\psi$) of the 1D time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle with arbitrary complex valued initial data and the set of ordered pairs of quantities (the beam strain and the particle velocity), which characterize solutions $u$ of the beam equation with arbitrary real valued initial data. Thus, the dynamics of a free infinite Euler-Bernoulli beam can be described by the Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle and vice versa. Finally, we show that for two corresponding solutions $u$ and $\psi$ the mechanical energy density calculated for $u$ propagates in the beam exactly in the same way as the probability density calculated for $\psi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with no external field and inverse temperature $\beta&lt;1$ and prove that the expected operator norm of the covariance matrix of the Gibbs measure is bounded by a constant depending only on $\beta$. This answers an open question raised by Talagrand, who proved a bound of $C(\beta) (\log n)^8$. Our result follows by establishing an approximate formula for the covariance matrix which we obtain by differentiating the TAP equations and then optimally controlling the associated error terms. We complement this result by showing diverging lower bounds on the operator norm, both at the critical and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>The soliton resolution conjecture for the Boussinesq equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Boussinesq equation on the line with Schwartz initial data belonging to the physically relevant class of global solutions. In a recent paper, we determined ten main asymptotic sectors describing the large $(x,t)$-behavior of the solution, and for each of these sectors we provided the leading order asymptotics in the case when no solitons are present. In this paper, we give a formula valid in the asymptotic sector $x/t \in (1,M]$, where $M$ is a large positive constant, in the case when solitons are present. Combined with earlier results, this validates the soliton resolution conjecture for the Boussinesq equation everywhere in the $(x,t)$-plane except in a number of small transition zones.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions for weak turbulence models in electrostatic plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12430v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak turbulence model, also known as the quasilinear theory in plasma physics, has been a cornerstone in modeling resonant particle-wave interactions in plasmas. This reduced model stems from the Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell system under the weak turbulence assumption, incorporating the random phase approximation and ergodicity. The interaction between particles and waves (plasmons) can be treated as a stochastic process, whose transition probability bridges the momentum space and the spectral space. Therefore, the operators on the right hand side resemble collision forms, such as those in Boltzmann and Landau interacting models. For them, there have been results on well-posedness and regularity of solutions. However, as far as we know, there is no such preceding work for the quasilinear theory addressed in this manuscript.
  In this paper, we establish the existence of global weak solutions for the system modeling electrostatic plasmas in one dimension. Our key contribution consists of associating the original integral-differential system to a degenerate inhomogeneous porous medium equation(PME) with nonlinear source terms, and leveraging advanced techniques from the PME literature. This approach opens a novel pathway for analyzing weak turbulence models in plasma physics. Moreover, our work offers new tools for tackling related problems in the broader context of nonlinear nonlocal PDEs.</description>

Abstract: In this article we use the philosophy in [OS22] to construct the quantum difference equation of affine type $A$ quiver varieties in terms of the quantum toroidal algebra $U_{q,t}(\hat{\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}}_{r})$. In the construction, and we define the set of wall for each quiver varieties by the action of the universal $R$-matrix, which is shown to be almost equivalent to that of the $K$-theoretic stable envelope on each interval in $H^2(X,\mathbb{Q})$. We also give the examples of the instanton moduli space $M(n,r)$ and the equivariant Hilbert scheme $\text{Hilb}_{n}([\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{r}])$ to show the explicit form of the quantum difference operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of an ensemble of entities obeying replicator-like stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions as a model for a primordial ecology. We prove the propagation-of-chaos property and establish conditions for the strong persistence of the $N$-replicator system and the existence of invariant distributions for a class of associated McKean-Vlasov dynamics. In particular, our results show that, unlike typical models of neutral ecology, fitness equivalence does not need to be assumed but emerges as a condition for the persistence of the system. Further, neutrality is associated with a unique Dirichlet invariant probability measure. We illustrate our findings with some simple case studies, provide numerical results, and discuss our conclusions in the light of Neutral Theory in ecology.</description>

      <title>Fast relaxation of the random field Ising dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence properties of Glauber dynamics for the random field Ising model (RFIM) with ferromagnetic interactions on finite domains of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$. Of particular interest is the Griffiths phase where correlations decay exponentially fast in expectation over the quenched disorder, but there exist arbitrarily large islands of weak fields where low-temperature behavior is observed. Our results are twofold:
  1. Under weak spatial mixing (boundary-to-bulk exponential decay of correlations) in expectation, we show that the dynamics satisfy a weak Poincar\'e inequality implying algebraic relaxation to equilibrium over timescales polynomial in the volume $N$ of the domain, and polynomial time mixing from a warm start. From this we construct a polynomial-time approximate sampling algorithm based on running Glauber dynamics over an increasing sequence of approximations of the domain.
  2. Under strong spatial mixing (exponential decay of correlations even near boundary pinnings) in expectation, we prove a full Poincar\'e inequality, implying exponential relaxation to equilibrium and $N^{o(1)}$-mixing time. Note by way of example, both weak and strong spatial mixing hold at any temperature, provided the external fields are strong enough.
  Our proofs combine a stochastic localization technique which has the effect of increasing the variance of the field, with a field-dependent coarse graining which controls the resulting sub-critical percolation process of sites with weak fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the continuation of the article \cite{Z23}. In this article we will give a detailed analysis of the quantum difference equation of the equivariant $K$-theory of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties. We will give a good representation of the quantum difference operator $\mathbf{M}_{\mathcal{L}}(z)$ such that the monodromy operator $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}(z)$in the formula can be written in the $U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-form or in the $U_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_1)$-form. We also give the detailed analysis of the connection matrix for the quantum difference equation in the nodal limit $p\rightarrow0$. Using these two results, we prove that the degeneration limit of the quantum difference equation is the Dubrovin connection for the quantum cohomology of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties, and the monodromy representation for the Dubrovin connection is generated by the monodromy operators $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$.</description>

Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We study the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere are rigid under smooth perturbations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>
