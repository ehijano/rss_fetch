      <title>Theories of Frege structure equivalent to Feferman's system $\mathsf{T}_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feferman (1975) defines an impredicative system $\mathsf{T}_0$ of explicit mathematics, which is proof-theoretically equivalent to the subsystem $\Delta^1_2$-$\mathsf{CA} + \mathsf{BI}$ of second-order arithmetic. In this paper, we propose several systems of Frege structure with the same proof-theoretic strength as $\mathsf{T}_0$. To be precise, we first consider the Kripke--Feferman theory, which is one of the most famous truth theories, and we extend it by two kinds of induction principles inspired by (J\"ager et al. 2001). In addition, we give similar results for the system based on Aczel's original Frege structure (Aczel 1980). Finally, we equip Cantini's supervaluation-style theory with the notion of universes, the strength of which was an open problem in (Kahle 2001).</description>

      <title>Herbrand's Theorem in Refutation Schemata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13905</link>

Abstract: An inductive proof can be represented as a proof schema, i.e. as a parameterized sequence of proofs defined in a primitive recursive way. A corresponding cut-elimination method, called schematic CERES, can be used to analyze these proofs, and to extract their (schematic) Herbrand sequents, even though Herbrand's theorem in general does not hold for proofs with induction inferences. This work focuses on the most crucial part of the schematic cut-elimination method, which is to construct a refutation of a schematic formula that represents the cut-structure of the original proof schema. We develop a new framework for schematic substitutions and define a unification algorithm for resolution schemata. Moreover, we show that this new formalism allows the extraction of a structure from the refutation schema, called a Herbrand schema, which represents its Herbrand sequent.</description>

      <title>Michael's selection theorem in general d-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thamrongthanyalak demonstrated a definable version of Michael's selection theorem in d-minimal expansions of the real field. We generalize this result to the case in which the structures are d-minimal expansions of ordered fields $\mathcal F=(F,&lt;,+,\cdot,0,1,\ldots)$. We also show that we can choose a definable continuous selection $f$ of a lower semi-continuous map $T:E \rightrightarrows F$ so that $f(x)$ is contained in the interior of $T(x)$ when the interior is not empty.</description>

      <title>On the Metric Temporal Logic for Continuous Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00984v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove measurability of event for which a general continuous-time stochastic process satisfies continuous-time Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formula. Continuous-time MTL can define temporal constrains for physical system in natural way. Then there are several researches that deal with probability of continuous MTL semantics for stochastic processes. However, proving measurability for such events is by no means an obvious task, even though it is essential. The difficulty comes from the semantics of "until operator", which is defined by logical sum of uncountably many propositions. Given the difficulty involved in proving the measurability of such an event using classical measure-theoretic methods, we employ a theorem from stochastic analysis. This theorem is utilized to prove the measurability of hitting times for stochastic processes, and it stands as a profound result within the theory of capacity. Next, we provide an example that illustrates the failure of probability approximation when discretizing the continuous semantics of MTL formulas with respect to time. Additionally, we prove that the probability of the discretized semantics converges to that of the continuous semantics when we impose restrictions on diamond operators to prevent nesting.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>
