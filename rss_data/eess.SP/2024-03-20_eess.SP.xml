      <title>A GNN Approach for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond 5G wireless technology Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) downlink relies on carefully designed precoders and power control to attain uniformly high rate coverage. Many such power control problems can be calculated via second order cone programming (SOCP). In practice, several order of magnitude faster numerical procedure is required because power control has to be rapidly updated to adapt to changing channel conditions. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solution to replace SOCP. Specifically, we develop a GNN to obtain downlink max-min power control for a CFmMIMO with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. We construct a graph representation of the problem that properly captures the dominant dependence relationship between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). We exploit a symmetry property, called permutation equivariance, to attain training simplicity and efficiency. Simulation results show the superiority of our approach in terms of computational complexity, scalability and generalizability for different system sizes and deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive LPD Radar Waveform Design with Generative Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, learning-based method for adaptively generating low probability of detection (LPD) radar waveforms that blend into their operating environment. Our waveforms are designed to follow a distribution that is indistinguishable from the ambient radio frequency (RF) background -- while still being effective at ranging and sensing. To do so, we use an unsupervised, adversarial learning framework; our generator network produces waveforms designed to confuse a critic network, which is optimized to differentiate generated waveforms from the background. To ensure our generated waveforms are still effective for sensing, we introduce and minimize an ambiguity function-based loss on the generated waveforms. We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing the single-pulse detectability of our generated waveforms with traditional LPD waveforms using a separately trained detection neural network. We find that our method can generate LPD waveforms that reduce detectability by up to 90% while simultaneously offering improved ambiguity function (sensing) characteristics. Our framework also provides a mechanism to trade-off detectability and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>A New Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Electromagnetic Stealth Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave absorbing material (EWAM) plays an essential role in manufacturing stealth aircraft, which can achieve the electromagnetic stealth (ES) by reducing the strength of the signal reflected back to the radar system. However, the stealth performance is limited by the coating thickness, incident wave angles, and working frequencies. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided ES system where an IRS is deployed at the target to synergize with EWAM for effectively mitigating the echo signal and thus reducing the radar detection probability. Considering the monotonic relationship between the detection probability and the received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the radar, we formulate an optimization problem that minimizes the SNR under the reflection constraint of each IRS element, and a semi-closed-form solution is derived by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed IRS-aided ES system compared to various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Block-Dominant Compressed Sensing for Near-Field Communications: Fundamentals, Solutions and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field (NF) communications draw much attention in the context of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA). Owing to a large number of antennas and high carrier frequency, the NF coverage distance is quite substantial, where the electromagnetic radiation propagates by spherical waves, in contrast to the conventional planar waves of the far-field. Motivated by these facts, the block-dominant compressed sensing (BD-CS) assisted NF communications are proposed. Specifically, we elucidate why block sparsity exists in the distance-limited NF region. Then, block-dominant side-information (BD-SI) is introduced in support of the actual NF communication implementation. We validate that BD-CS is capable of providing exceptional channel estimation accuracy and high spectral efficiency, where the associated challenges, opportunities and its actual implementation in NF communications need to be carefully addressed.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback for RIS-Aided Massive MIMO Systems with Time Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink system.In the FDD systems, the downlink channel state information (CSI) should be sent to the base station through the feedback link. However, the overhead of CSI feedback occupies substantial uplink bandwidth resources in RIS-aided communication systems. In this work, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based scheme to reduce the overhead of CSI feedback by compressing the cascaded CSI. In the practical RIS-aided communication systems, the cascaded channel at the adjacent slots inevitably has time correlation. We use long short-term memory to learn time correlation, which can help the neural network to improve the recovery quality of the compressed CSI. Moreover, the attention mechanism is introduced to further improve the CSI recovery quality. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed DLbased scheme can significantly outperform other DL-based methods in terms of the CSI recovery quality</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Channel for 6G: Concepts, Architectures and Potential Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin channel (DTC) is the real-time mapping of a wireless channel for the physical wireless communication in the digital world, which is expected to be one of the essential enablers for the sixth-generation (6G) communication systems and provides significant performance enhancements for air-interface design. In this work, we first define the evolution of five levels of channel twins with the progression of wireless communication. The autonomous DTC for 6G is elaborated from multi-dimensional factors such as methodology, characterization precision, and data category. Then, we provide detailed insights into the requirements and architecture of a complete DTC for 6G. Subsequently, a sensing-enhanced real-time channel prediction platform and experimental validations are exhibited. Finally, drawing from the vision of the 6G network, we explore potential applications and address open issues in DTC research.</description>

      <title>Non-negative matrix underapproximation as optimal frequency band selector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-frequency representation (TFR) is often used for non-stationary signal analysis. The most intuitive and interpretable TFR is the spectrogram. Recently, a concept of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied to local damage detection in rolling elements of bearings via spectrogram factorization. NMF applied to the spectrogram allows one to find an informative frequency band, which could be further used as a filter characteristic. However, the obtained filter characteristics mostly detect the informative frequency band, which also encompasses a lot of noise. In the case where noise is more problematic, as is the case for acoustic signals from industrial machines, the NMF hardly detects the damage. To solve this problem and obtain more selective filters, which are more robust to noise, we propose the non-negative matrix under-approximation (NMU) as an informative frequency band selector. Due to the more sparse parts-based representation of the NMU compared to NMF, NMU provides more selective filter characteristics, which neglect the non-informative frequency bands related to the noise. In practice, it means that NMU gives a better signal-to-noise ratio for the filtered signal. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been validated on the vibration signal from the test rig and the acoustic signal from an idler.</description>

      <title>Non-negative tensor factorization for vibration-based local damage detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a novel non-negative tensor factorization (NTF)-based method for vibration-based local damage detection in rolling element bearings is proposed. As the diagnostic signal registered from a faulty machine is non-stationary, the time-frequency method is frequently used as a primary decomposition technique. It is proposed here to extract multi-linear NTF-based components from a 3D array of time-frequency representations of an observed signal partitioned into blocks. As a result, frequency and temporal informative components can be efficiently separated from non-informative ones. The experiments performed on synthetic and real signals demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method with respect to the already known non-negative matrix factorization approach.</description>

      <title>Bearing damage detection with orthogonal and non-negative low-rank feature extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local damage of bearings can be detected as a weak cyclic and impulsive component in a highly noisy measured signal. A key problem is how to extract the signal of interest (SOI) from the raw signal, i.e., how to identify and design an optimal filter. To tackle this problem, we propose to use stochastic sampled orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization for extracting frequency-based features from a spectrogram of the measured signal. The proposed algorithm finds a selective filter that is tailored to the frequency band of the SOI. We show that our approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art selectors that were previously used in condition monitoring. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated using both a simulation study and the following real signals: (a) vibration signal from a test rig in the laboratory and (b) acoustic signal from a belt conveyor.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive feature mode decomposition based on a novel health indicator for bearing fault diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibration analysis of the bearing is very crucial because of its non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, a novel scheme for detecting bearing defects is put forward based on the extraction of single-valued neutrosophic cross-entropy (SVNCE) to address this issue. Initially, the artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) is used to make the feature mode decomposition (FMD) adaptive by optimizing its parameter based on a newly developed health indicator (HI) i.e. sparsity impact measure index (SIMI). This HI ensures full sparsity and impact properties simultaneously. The raw signals are disintegrated into different modes by adaptive FMD at optimal values of its parameters. The energy of these modes is calculated for different health conditions. The energy interval range has been decided based on energy eigen which are then transformed into single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) for unknown defect conditions. The minimum argument principle employs the least SVNCE values between SVNSs of testing samples (obtained from unknown bearing conditions) and SVNSs of training samples (obtained from known bearing conditions) to recognize the different defects in the bearing. It has been discovered that the suggested methodology is more adept at identifying the various bearing defects.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation in Dual-Band XL-MIMO with Side Information-Assisted Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field communication comes to be an indispensable part of the future sixth generation (6G) communications at the arrival of the forth-coming deployment of extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Due to the substantial number of antennas, the electromagnetic radiation field is modeled by the spherical waves instead of the conventional planar waves, leading to severe weak sparsity to angular-domain near-field channel. Therefore, the channel estimation reminiscent of the conventional compression sensing (CS) approaches in the angular domain, judiciously utilized for low pilot overhead, may result in unprecedented challenges. To this end, this paper proposes a brand-new near-field channel estimation scheme by exploiting the naturally occurring useful side information. Specifically, we formulate the dual-band near-field communication model based on the fact that high-frequency systems are likely to be deployed with lower-frequency systems. Representative side information, i.e., the structural characteristic information derived by the sparsity ambiguity and the out-of-band spatial information stemming from the lower-frequency channel, is explored and tailored to materialize exceptional near-field channel estimation. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analyses are developed to guarantee the minimum estimation error, based on which a suite of algorithms leveraging the elaborating side information are proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the designed algorithms provide more assured results than the off-the-shelf approaches in the context of the dual-band near-field communications in both on- and off-grid scenarios, where the angle of departures/arrivals are discretely or continuously distributed, respectively.</description>

      <title>Small Distance Increment Method for Measuring Complex Permittivity With mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the complex permittivity of material is essential in many scenarios such as quality check and component analysis. Generally, measurement methods for characterizing the material are based on the usage of vector network analyzer, which is large and not easy for on-site measurement, especially in high frequency range such as millimeter wave (mmWave). In addition, some measurement methods require the destruction of samples, which is not suitable for non-destructive inspection. In this work, a small distance increment (SDI) method is proposed to non-destructively measure the complex permittivity of material. In SDI, the transmitter and receiver are formed as the monostatic radar, which is facing towards the material under test (MUT). During the measurement, the distance between radar and MUT changes with small increments and the signals are recorded at each position. A mathematical model is formulated to depict the relationship among the complex permittivity, distance increment, and measured signals. By fitting the model, the complex permittivity of MUT is estimated. To implement and evaluate the proposed SDI method, a commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar is utilized and the measurement system is developed. Then, the evaluation was carried out on the acrylic plate. With the proposed method, the estimated complex permittivity of acrylic plate shows good agreement with the literature values, demonstrating the efficacy of SDI method for characterizing the complex permittivity of material.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale RIS Enabled Air-Ground Channels: Near-Field Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works mainly rely on the far-field planar-wave-based channel model to assess the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled wireless communication systems. However, when the transmitter and receiver are in near-field ranges, this will result in relatively low computing accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we initially develop an analytical framework for sub-array partitioning. This framework divides the large-scale RIS array into multiple sub-arrays, effectively reducing modeling complexity while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Then, we develop a beam domain channel model based on the proposed sub-array partition framework for large-scale RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle communication systems, which can be used to efficiently capture the sparse features in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle channels in both near-field and far-field ranges. Furthermore, some important propagation characteristics of the proposed channel model, including the spatial cross-correlation functions (CCFs), temporal auto-correlation functions (ACFs), frequency correlation functions (CFs), and channel capacities with respect to the different physical features of the RIS and non-stationary properties of the channel model are derived and analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed framework is helpful to achieve a good tradeoff between model complexity and accuracy for investigating the channel propagation characteristics, and therefore providing highly-efficient communications in RIS-enabled UAV-to-vehicle wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Ziv-Zakai-Optimal OFDM Resource Allocation for Time-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents methods of optimizing the placement and power allocations of pilots in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal to minimize time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation errors under power and resource allocation constraints. TOA errors in this optimization are quantified through the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB), which captures error thresholding effects caused by sidelobes in the signal's autocorrelation function (ACF) which are not captured by the Cramer-Rao lower bound. This paper is the first to solve for these ZZB-optimal allocations in the context of OFDM signals, under integer resource allocation constraints, and under both coherent and noncoherent reception. Under convex constraints, the optimization of the ZZB is proven to be convex; under integer constraints, the optimization is lower bounded by a convex relaxation and a branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed for efficiently allocating pilot resources. These allocations are evaluated by their ZZBs and ACFs, compared against a typical uniform allocation, and deployed on a software-defined radio TOA measurement platform to demonstrate their applicability in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Analysis of Radio Resource Assignment for UAV-Enhanced Vehicular Sidelink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and the shift towards millimiter-wave (mmWave) frequencies offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance road safety and traffic efficiency. Sidelink communication, enabling direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, play a pivotal role in this transformation. As communication technologies transit to higher frequencies, the associated increase in bandwidth comes at the cost of a severe path and penetration loss. In response to these challenges, we investigate a network configuration that deploys beamforming-capable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as relay nodes. In this work, we present a comprehensive analytical framework with a groundbreaking performance metric, i.e. average access probability, that quantifies user satisfaction, considering factors across different protocol stack layers. Additionally, we introduce two Radio Resources Assignment (RRA) methods tailored for UAVs. These methods consider parameters such as resource availability, vehicle distribution, and latency requirements. Through our analytical approach, we optimize the average access probability by controlling UAV altitude based on traffic density. Our numerical findings validate the proposed model and strategy, which ensures that Quality of Service (QoS) standards are met in the domain of Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X) sidelink communications.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Modeling for Electromagnetic Information Theory</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is one of the important topics for 6G communication due to its potential to reveal the performance limit of wireless communication systems. For EIT, the research foundation is reasonable and accurate channel modeling. Existing channel modeling works for EIT in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenario focus on far-field modeling, which can not accurately capture the characteristics of the channel in near-field. In this paper, we propose the near-field channel model for EIT based on electromagnetic scattering theory. We model the channel by using non-stationary Gaussian random fields and derive the analytical expression of the correlation function of the fields. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of the proposed channel model, e.g., the sparsity of the model in wavenumber domain. Based on the sparsity of the model, we design a channel estimation scheme for near-field scenario. Numerical analysis verifies the correctness of the proposed scheme and shows that it can outperform existing schemes like least square (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).</description>

      <title>BostonTwin: the Boston Digital Twin for Ray-Tracing in 6G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins are now a staple of wireless networks design and evolution. Creating an accurate digital copy of a real system offers numerous opportunities to study and analyze its performance and issues. It also allows designing and testing new solutions in a risk-free environment, and applying them back to the real system after validation. A candidate technology that will heavily rely on digital twins for design and deployment is 6G, which promises robust and ubiquitous networks for eXtended Reality (XR) and immersive communications solutions. In this paper, we present BostonTwin, a dataset that merges a high-fidelity 3D model of the city of Boston, MA, with the existing geospatial data on cellular base stations deployments, in a ray-tracing-ready format. Thus, BostonTwin enables not only the instantaneous rendering and programmatic access to the building models, but it also allows for an accurate representation of the electromagnetic propagation environment in the real-world city of Boston. The level of detail and accuracy of this characterization is crucial to designing 6G networks that can support the strict requirements of sensitive and high-bandwidth applications, such as XR and immersive communication.</description>

      <title>Sim2Real in Reconstructive Spectroscopy: Deep Learning with Augmented Device-Informed Data Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a deep learning (DL)-based framework, namely Sim2Real, for spectral signal reconstruction in reconstructive spectroscopy, focusing on efficient data sampling and fast inference time. The work focuses on the challenge of reconstructing real-world spectral signals under the extreme setting where only device-informed simulated data are available for training. Such device-informed simulated data are much easier to collect than real-world data but exhibit large distribution shifts from their real-world counterparts. To leverage such simulated data effectively, a hierarchical data augmentation strategy is introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of this domain shift, and a corresponding neural network for the spectral signal reconstruction with our augmented data is designed. Experiments using a real dataset measured from our spectrometer device demonstrate that Sim2Real achieves significant speed-up during the inference while attaining on-par performance with the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods.</description>

      <title>Finding the Missing Data: A BERT-inspired Approach Against Package Loss in Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the development of various deep learning methods for Wi-Fi sensing, package loss often results in noncontinuous estimation of the Channel State Information (CSI), which negatively impacts the performance of the learning models. To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep learning model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for CSI recovery, named CSI-BERT. CSI-BERT can be trained in an self-supervised manner on the target dataset without the need for additional data. Furthermore, unlike traditional interpolation methods that focus on one subcarrier at a time, CSI-BERT captures the sequential relationships across different subcarriers. Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT achieves lower error rates and faster speed compared to traditional interpolation methods, even when facing with high loss rates. Moreover, by harnessing the recovered CSI obtained from CSI-BERT, other deep learning models like Residual Network and Recurrent Neural Network can achieve an average increase in accuracy of approximately 15\% in Wi-Fi sensing tasks. The collected dataset WiGesture and code for our model are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CSI-BERT.</description>

      <title>WMMSE-Based Rate Maximization for RIS-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, given its ability to favorably modify wireless communication environments, will play a pivotal role in the evolution of future communication systems. This paper proposes rate maximization techniques for both single-user and multiuser MIMO systems, based on the well-known weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) criterion. Using a suitable weight matrix, the WMMSE algorithm tackles an equivalent weighted mean square error (WMSE) minimization problem to achieve the sum-rate maximization. By considering a more practical RIS system model that employs a tensor-based representation enforced by the electromagnetic behavior exhibited by the RIS panel, we detail both the sum-rate maximizing and WMSE minimizing strategies for RIS phase shift optimization by deriving the closed-form gradient of the WMSE and the sum-rate with respect to the RIS phase shift vector. Our simulations reveal that the proposed rate maximization technique, rooted in the WMMSE algorithm, exhibits superior performance when compared to other benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) is promising as one of the key ingredients for the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communications. The electromagnetic propagation of spherical wavefronts introduces an additional distance-dependent dimension beyond conventional beamspace. In this paper, we first present one concise closed-form channel formulation for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO). All line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, far-field and near-field scenarios, and XL-MIMO and XL-MISO channels are unified under the framework, where additional Vandermonde windowing matrix is exclusively considered for LoS path. Under this framework, we further propose one low-complexity unified LoS/NLoS orthogonal matching pursuit (XL-UOMP) algorithm for XL-MIMO channel estimation. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm on both estimation accuracy and pilot consumption.</description>

Abstract: Point processes are finding growing applications in numerous fields, such as neuroscience, high frequency finance and social media. So classic problems of classification and clustering are of increasing interest. However, analytic study of misclassification error probability in multi-class classification has barely begun. In this paper, we tackle the multi-class likelihood classification problem for point processes and develop, for the first time, both asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the error rate in terms of computable pair-wise affinities. We apply these general results to classifying renewal processes. Under some technical conditions, we show that the bounds have exponential decay and give explicit associated constants. The results are illustrated with a non-trivial simulation.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable antenna multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for upcoming 6G communication systems. In this paper, we deal with the problem of configuration selection for reconfigurable antenna MIMO by leveraging Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs). By adopting the CIM as a heuristic solver for the Ising problem, the optimal antenna configuration that maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio is investigated. A mathematical framework that converts the selection problem into a CIM-compatible unconstrained quadratic formulation is presented. Numerical studies show that the proposed CIM-based design outperforms classical counterparts and achieves near-optimal performance (similar to exponentially complex exhaustive searching) while ensuring polynomial complexity.</description>

Abstract: Social learning is a non-Bayesian framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents towards a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows to discover the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>

      <title>Knowledge and Data Dual-Driven Channel Estimation and Feedback for Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems under Hybrid Field Beam Squint Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at an access point (AP) is challenging for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (UMMIMO) systems, due to the high-dimensional channel matrices, hybrid near- and far- field channel feature, beam squint effects, and imperfect hardware constraints, such as low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and in-phase and quadrature imbalance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient downlink channel estimation (CE) and CSI feedback approach based on knowledge and data dual-driven deep learning (DL) networks. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven residual neural network de-quantizer (ResNet-DQ) to pre-process the received pilot signals at user equipment (UEs), where the noise and distortion brought by imperfect hardware can be mitigated. A knowledge-driven generalized multiple measurement vector learned approximate message passing (GMMV-LAMP) network is then developed to jointly estimate the channels by exploiting the approximately same physical angle shared by different subcarriers. In particular, two wideband redundant dictionaries (WRDs) are proposed such that the measurement matrices of the GMMV-LAMP network can accommodate the far-field and near-field beam squint effect, respectively. Finally, we propose an encoder at the UEs and a decoder at the AP by a data-driven CSI residual network (CSI-ResNet) to compress the CSI matrix into a low-dimensional quantized bit vector for feedback, thereby reducing the feedback overhead substantially. Simulation results show that the proposed knowledge and data dual-driven approach outperforms conventional downlink CE and CSI feedback methods, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

Abstract: This study focuses on developing an experimental system for estimating communication channels in a multi-robot mobile system using software-defined radio (SDR) devices. The system consists of two mobile robots programmed for two scenarios: one where the robot remains stationary and another where it follows a predefined trajectory. Communication within the system is conducted through orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate the effects of multipath propagation in indoor environments. The system's performance is evaluated using the bit error rate (BER). Connections related to robot motion and communication are implemented using Raspberry Pi 3 and BladeRF x115, respectively. The least squares (LS) technique is employed to estimate the channel with a bit error rate of approximately 10^(-2).</description>

Abstract: This work studies the wideband modeling and beamforming design of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which generalizes and goes beyond conventional RIS with diagonal phase shift matrices to achieve enhanced channel gain. Specifically, we investigate the response of BD-RIS in wideband systems by going back to its hardware circuit realizations. We propose a novel wideband model which has simple expressions while capturing the response variations of BD-RIS for signals with different frequencies. With this wideband model, we propose a BD-RIS design algorithm for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system to maximize the average rate over all subcarriers. Finally, we provide simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed design and show the importance of wideband modeling for BD-RIS.</description>

      <title>Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Decentralized Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) is a popular algorithm used to solve decentralized optimization problems in diverse domains such as remote sensing, distributed inference, multi-agent coordination, and federated learning. Yet, executing DGD over wireless systems affected by noise, fading and limited bandwidth presents challenges, requiring scheduling of transmissions to mitigate interference and the acquisition of topology and channel state information -- complex tasks in wireless decentralized systems. This paper proposes a DGD algorithm tailored to wireless systems. Unlike existing approaches, it operates without inter-agent coordination, topology information, or channel state information. Its core is a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA) consensus scheme, exploiting a noisy energy superposition property of wireless channels. With a randomized transmission strategy to accommodate half-duplex operation, transmitters map local optimization signals to energy levels across subcarriers in an OFDM frame, and transmit concurrently without coordination. It is shown that received energies form a noisy consensus signal, whose fluctuations are mitigated via a consensus stepsize. NCOTA-DGD leverages the channel pathloss for consensus formation, without explicit knowledge of the mixing weights. It is shown that, for the class of strongly-convex problems, the expected squared distance between the local and globally optimum models vanishes with rate $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$ after $k$ iterations, with a proper design of decreasing stepsizes. Extensions address a broad class of fading models and frequency-selective channels. Numerical results on an image classification task depict faster convergence vis-\`a-vis running time than state-of-the-art schemes, especially in densely deployed networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical graph matching aims to find a node correspondence between two unlabeled graphs of known topologies. This problem has a wide range of applications, from matching identities in social networks to identifying similar biological network functions across species. However, when the underlying graphs are unknown, the use of conventional graph matching methods requires inferring the graph topologies first, a process that is highly sensitive to observation errors. In this paper, we tackle the blind graph matching problem with unknown underlying graphs directly using observations of graph signals, which are generated from graph filters applied to graph signal excitations. We propose to construct sample covariance matrices from the observed signals and match the nodes based on the selected sample eigenvectors. Our analysis shows that the blind matching outcome converges to the result obtained with known graph topologies when the signal sampling size is large and the signal noise is small. Numerical results showcase the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm compared to matching two estimated underlying graphs learned from the graph signals.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECG) are widely employed as a diagnostic tool for monitoring electrical signals originating from a heart. Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data. Our code is available at https://github.com/bakqui/ST-MEM.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning enabled semantic communications have shown great potential to significantly improve transmission efficiency and alleviate spectrum scarcity, by effectively exchanging the semantics behind the data. Recently, the emergence of large models, boasting billions of parameters, has unveiled remarkable human-like intelligence, offering a promising avenue for advancing semantic communication by enhancing semantic understanding and contextual understanding. This article systematically investigates the large model-empowered semantic communication systems from potential applications to system design. First, we propose a new semantic communication architecture that seamlessly integrates large models into semantic communication through the introduction of a memory module. Then, the typical applications are illustrated to show the benefits of the new architecture. Besides, we discuss the key designs in implementing the new semantic communication systems from module design to system training. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to boost the large model-empowered semantic communications.</description>

      <title>When Robotics Meets Wireless Communications: An Introductory Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of ground Mobile Robots (MRs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within the research community, industry, and society is growing fast. Many of these agents are nowadays equipped with communication systems that are, in some cases, essential to successfully achieve certain tasks. In this context, we have begun to witness the development of a new interdisciplinary research field at the intersection of robotics and communications. This research field has been boosted by the intention of integrating UAVs within the 5G and 6G communication networks. This research will undoubtedly lead to many important applications in the near future. Nevertheless, one of the main obstacles to the development of this research area is that most researchers address these problems by oversimplifying either the robotics or the communications aspect. This impedes the ability of reaching the full potential of this new interdisciplinary research area. In this tutorial, we present some of the modelling tools necessary to address problems involving both robotics and communication from an interdisciplinary perspective. As an illustrative example of such problems, we focus in this tutorial on the issue of communication-aware trajectory planning.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) scheme for image transmission over a half-duplex cooperative relay channel. Specifically, we apply DeepJSCC to two basic modes of cooperative communications, namely amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). In DeepJSCC-AF, the relay simply amplifies and forwards its received signal. In DeepJSCC-DF, on the other hand, the relay first reconstructs the transmitted image and then re-encodes it before forwarding. Considering the excessive computation overhead of DeepJSCC-DF for recovering the image at the relay, we propose an alternative scheme, called DeepJSCC-PF, in which the relay processes and forwards its received signal without necessarily recovering the image. Simulation results show that the proposed DeepJSCC-AF, DF, and PF schemes are superior to the digital baselines with BPG compression with polar codes and provides a graceful performance degradation with deteriorating channel quality. Further investigation shows that the PSNR gain of DeepJSCC-DF/PF over DeepJSCC-AF improves as the channel condition between the source and relay improves. Moreover, DeepJSCC-PF scheme achieves a similar performance to DeepJSCC-DF with lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Holographic MIMO Communications: What is the benefit of closely spaced antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic MIMO refers to a (possibly large) array with a large number of individually controlled and densely deployed antennas. The objective of this paper is to provide further insight into the use of closely spaced antennas in the uplink and downlink of a multi-user Holographic MIMO system. To this end, we utilize multiport communication theory, which ensures physically consistent uplink and downlink models. We first consider a simple uplink scenario with two side-by-side half-wavelength dipoles, two users, and single-path line-of-sight propagation, and show both analytically and numerically that the array gain and average spectral efficiency strongly depend on the directions from which the signals are received and on the array matching network used. The numerical results are then used to extend the analysis to more practical scenarios involving larger arrays of dipoles (arranged in a uniform linear array) and a larger number of users. The case where the antennas are densely packed in a space-constrained factor form is also considered. It is found that the spectral efficiency increases with decreasing antenna spacing only for arrays of moderate size, e.g. in the order of a few wavelengths. In comparison, larger arrays with closely spaced antennas show only marginal improvements in spectral efficiency compared to half-wavelength arrays.</description>

      <title>SplitMAC: Wireless Split Learning over Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel split learning (SL) framework, referred to as SplitMAC, which reduces the latency of SL by leveraging simultaneous uplink transmission over multiple access channels. The key strategy is to divide devices into multiple groups and allow the devices within the same group to simultaneously transmit their smashed data and device-side models over the multiple access channels. The optimization problem of device grouping to minimize SL latency is formulated, and the benefit of device grouping in reducing the uplink latency of SL is theoretically derived. By examining a two-device grouping case, two asymptotically-optimal algorithms are devised for device grouping in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios, respectively, while providing proofs of their optimality. By merging these algorithms, a near-optimal device grouping algorithm is proposed to cover a wide range of SNR. Our SL framework is also extended to consider practical fading channels and to support a general group size. Simulation results demonstrate that our SL framework with the proposed device grouping algorithm is superior to existing SL frameworks in reducing SL latency.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-MLP: Learning on Hypergraphs without Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are vital in modelling data with higher-order relations containing more than two entities, gaining prominence in machine learning and signal processing. Many hypergraph neural networks leverage message passing over hypergraph structures to enhance node representation learning, yielding impressive performances in tasks like hypergraph node classification. However, these message-passing-based models face several challenges, including oversmoothing as well as high latency and sensitivity to structural perturbations at inference time. To tackle those challenges, we propose an alternative approach where we integrate the information about hypergraph structures into training supervision without explicit message passing, thus also removing the reliance on it at inference. Specifically, we introduce Hypergraph-MLP, a novel learning framework for hypergraph-structured data, where the learning model is a straightforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) supervised by a loss function based on a notion of signal smoothness on hypergraphs. Experiments on hypergraph node classification tasks demonstrate that Hypergraph-MLP achieves competitive performance compared to existing baselines, and is considerably faster and more robust against structural perturbations at inference.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Neural Network based Federated Learning for Multi-user Indoor Positioning Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, the use of channel state information (CSI) for indoor positioning is studied. In the considered model, a server equipped with several antennas sends pilot signals to users, while each user uses the received pilot signals to estimate channel states for user positioning. To this end, we formulate the positioning problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the gap between the estimated positions and the ground truth positions of users. To solve this problem, we design a complex-valued neural network (CVNN) model based federated learning (FL) algorithm. Compared to standard real-valued centralized machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed algorithm has two main advantages. First, our proposed algorithm can directly process complex-valued CSI data without data transformation. Second, our proposed algorithm is a distributed ML method that does not require users to send their CSI data to the server. Since the output of our proposed algorithm is complex-valued which consists of the real and imaginary parts, we study the use of the CVNN to implement two learning tasks. First, the proposed algorithm directly outputs the estimated positions of a user. Here, the real and imaginary parts of an output neuron represent the 2D coordinates of the user. Second, the proposed method can output two CSI features (i.e., line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight transmission link classification and time of arrival (TOA) prediction) which can be used in traditional positioning algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed CVNN based FL can reduce the mean positioning error between the estimated position and the actual position by up to 36%, compared to a RVNN based FL which requires to transform CSI data into real-valued data.</description>

      <title>Smart Resource Allocation at mmWave/THz Frequencies with Cooperative Rate-Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose algorithms to minimize the energy consumption in millimeter wave/terahertz multi-user downlink communication systems. To ensure coverage in blockage-vulnerable high frequency systems, we consider cooperative rate-splitting (CRS) and transmission over multiple time blocks, where via CRS, multiple users cooperate to assist a blocked user. Moreover, we show that transmission over multiple time blocks provides benefits through smart resource allocation. We first propose a communication framework named improved distinct extraction-based CRS (iDeCRS) that utilizes the benefits of rate-splitting. With our transmission framework, we derive a performance benchmark assuming genie channel state information (CSI), i.e., the channels of the present and future time blocks are known, denoted as GENIE. Using the results from GENIE, we derive a novel efficiency constrained optimization (ECO) algorithm assuming instantaneous CSI. In addition, a simple but effective even data transmission (EDT) algorithm that promotes steady transmission along the time blocks is proposed. Simulation results show that ECO and EDT have satisfactory performances compared to GENIE. The results also show that ECO outperforms EDT when many users are cooperating, and vise versa.</description>

      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Autonomous Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a prospective wireless technology that enhances wireless channel quality. An RIS is often equipped with passive array of elements and provides cost and power-efficient solutions for coverage extension of wireless communication systems. Without any radio frequency (RF) chains or computing resources, however, the RIS requires control information to be sent to it from an external unit, e.g., a base station (BS). The control information can be delivered by wired or wireless channels, and the BS must be aware of the RIS and the RIS-related channel conditions in order to effectively configure its behavior. Recent works have introduced hybrid RIS structures possessing a few active elements that can sense and digitally process received data. Here, we propose the operation of an entirely autonomous RIS that operates without a control link between the RIS and BS. Using a few sensing elements, the autonomous RIS employs a deep Q network (DQN) based on reinforcement learning in order to enhance the sum rate of the network. Our results illustrate the potential of deploying autonomous RISs in wireless networks with essentially no network overhead.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex MU-MIMO Systems with Coarse Quantization: How Many Bits Do We Need?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates full-duplex (FD) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system design with coarse quantization. We first analyze the impact of self-interference (SI) on quantization in FD single-input single-output systems. The analysis elucidates that the minimum required number of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) bits is logarithmically proportional to the ratio of total received power to the received power of desired signals. Motivated by this, we design a FD MIMO beamforming method that effectively manages the SI. Dividing a spectral efficiency maximization beamforming problem into two sub-problems for alternating optimization, we address the first by optimizing the precoder: obtaining a generalized eigenvalue problem from the first-order optimality condition, where the principal eigenvector is the optimal stationary solution, and adopting a power iteration method to identify this eigenvector. Subsequently, a quantization-aware minimum mean square error combiner is computed for the derived precoder. Through numerical studies, we observe that the proposed beamformer reduces the minimum required number of ADC bits for achieving higher spectral efficiency than that of half-duplex (HD) systems, compared to FD benchmarks. The overall analysis shows that, unlike with quantized HD systems, more than 6 bits are required for the ADC to fully realize the potential of the quantized FD system.</description>
