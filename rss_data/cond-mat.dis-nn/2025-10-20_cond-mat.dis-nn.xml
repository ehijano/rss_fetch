      <title>Proposal for many-body quantum chaos detection with single-site measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the long-time dynamics of an observable associated with a single lattice site is sufficient to determine whether a many-body quantum system exhibits level statistics characteristic of random matrix theory, a widely used diagnostic of quantum chaos. In particular, we focus on the partial survival probability and spin autocorrelation function at a single site, both evolved under a disordered spin-1/2 chain, which is a setup realizable in current experimental platforms. Given the precision and timescales currently achievable, our results indicate that the detection of many-body quantum chaos is feasible, but constrained to small system sizes.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic transport of neural network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational methods have offered controllable and powerful tools for capturing many-body quantum physics for decades. The recent introduction of expressive neural network quantum states has enabled the accurate representation of a broad class of complex wavefunctions for many Hamiltonians of interest. We introduce a first-principles method for building neural network representations of many-body excited states by adiabatically continuing eigenstates of simple Hamiltonians into the strongly correlated regime. With controlled access to the full many-body gap, we obtain accurate estimates of critical exponents. Successive eigenstate estimates can be run entirely in parallel, enabling precise targeting of excited-state properties without reference to the rest of the spectrum, opening the door to large-scale numerical investigations of universal properties of entire phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Morphotropic Phase Boundary (MPB) Induced Enhancement of Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Properties in Li and Ta modified K0.5Na0.5NbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-free (K0.48Na0.48Li0.04)(Nb1-xTax)O3 (KNLNT-x) ceramics were synthesized to study the effects of Li and Ta substitution on phase transition behavior, microstructure, and ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy show that compositions with x &lt; 0.10 exhibit a single orthorhombic (Amm2) phase, while 0.10 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.20 show coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal (Amm2 + P4mm) phases. For x &gt; 0.20, a single tetragonal (P4mm) phase is obtained. Microstructural analysis shows a dense ceramic with decreasing grain size as Ta concentration increases. Temperature-dependent dielectric studies reveal two transitions: orthorhombic-tetragonal (TO-T) and tetragonal-cubic (TC). Both transition temperatures decrease systematically with increasing Ta, and TO-T shifts below room temperature for x &gt; 0.15. The composition KNLNT-0.20 exhibits the highest dielectric constant (Er = 556) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 159 pC/N). The enhanced piezoelectric response is attributed to a morphotropic phase boundary rather than a shift of the polymorphic phase boundary temperature. A composition-temperature phase diagram was constructed based on XRD, Raman, and dielectric data.</description>

      <title>Identifying internal patterns in (1+1)-dimensional directed percolation using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a neural network-based method for the automatic detection of phase transitions and classification of hidden percolation patterns in a (1+1)-dimensional replication process. The proposed network model is based on the combination of CNN, TCN and GRU networks, which are trained directly on raw configurations without any manual feature extraction. The network reproduces the phase diagram and assigns phase labels to configurations. It shows that deep architectures are capable of extracting hierarchical structures from the raw data of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Friction-controlled reentrant aging and fluidization in granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular materials densify under repeated mechanical perturbations, a nonequilibrium dynamics that underlies many natural and industrial processes. Because granular relaxation is governed by frictional contacts and energy dissipation, this aging behavior fundamentally differs from that of thermal glasses despite their apparent similarities. Here, we uncover how friction controls the compaction dynamics of granular packings subjected to cyclic shear. Using discrete element simulations, we construct a dynamic state diagram as a function of strain amplitude and friction, revealing a rich interplay between jamming marginality, stabilization, and fluidization. We identify a friction-dependent crossover strain that separates aging and fluidized regimes, showing reentrant, non-monotonic behavior: Increasing friction first suppresses fluidization, then promotes it through smooth, creep-like rearrangements. This transition is marked by a shift from intermittent, avalanche-like rearrangements to continuous, diffusive motion. Our findings demonstrate that friction exerts a dual role in granular aging -- both stabilizing and fluidizing -- thereby uncovering the fundamental nonequilibrium mechanisms that govern compaction, rheology, and aging in athermal disordered systems. More broadly, our results reveal a general principle for how friction governs metastability and flow in athermal matter -- from granular and frictional colloids to soils and seismic faults -- linking microscopic contact mechanics to macroscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>The impact of dimensionality on universality of 2D quantum Hall transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regardless of model and platform details, the critical phenomena exhibit universal behaviors that are remarkably consistent across various experiments and theories, resulting in a significant scientific success of condensed matter physics. One widely known and commonly used example is the 2D quantum Hall transition; yet, its universal exponents still somewhat conflict between experiments, theoretical models, and numerical ansatzes. We study critical behaviors of quasi-2D Weyl semimetal systems with a finite thickness $L_z&gt;1$, disorder, and external magnetic field $B_z$. By analyzing the scaling behaviors of the localization lengths and local density of states using recursive methods, we find that the finite thickness yields a deviation from the 2D quantum Hall universality ($L_z=1$ case) and a crossover toward the 3D Gaussian Unitary Ensemble ($L_z\rightarrow \infty$ limit), potentially offering another cause of the discrepancy. Our work demonstrates the often-overlooked importance of auxiliary degrees of freedom, such as thickness, and that 3D quantum Hall physics is not merely a trivial finite-thickness extension of its 2D counterpart.</description>

      <title>The Wishart--Rosenzweig--Porter random matrix ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the ``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase, coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</description>

      <title>Amplitude equations of associative memory patterns in spatially distributed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution equations are derived for the amplitudes of associative memories: heterogeneous states stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with non-local interactions. The resulting coupled amplitude equations describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of memory recall. They capture pattern completion and selection, and show that short-range connections can sustain spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics in the form of propagating patterning fronts. The derived amplitude equations are of the same form as those describing classical pattern-forming instabilities, indicating a universality of the dynamics of memory recall and pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy of the measurement record at measurement-dominated criticality and RG flow: A c-theorem for effective central charge and a g-theorem for effective boundary entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two theorems demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease under relevant renormalization group (RG) flow of two quantities, $c_{\text{eff}}$ and $g_{\text{eff}}$ characterizing, respectively, the universal information content of the Shannon entropy of the measurement record for two different types of measurement-dominated criticality. First, we demonstrate the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}$ of $2D$ replica field theories in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit that govern the long-distance physics of weakly monitored $2D$ classical critical systems (Baysian inference problems) studied recently in the literature [arXiv:2504.01264; arXiv:2504.12385; arXiv:2504.08888]. In particular, we show that $c_{\text{eff}}$ is $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unmeasured critical system. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem''. In addition, we present an analogous "$g$-effective theorem" demonstrating the decrease under RG flow of the effective "Affleck-Ludwig'' boundary entropy $\ln g_\text{eff}$, quantifying a corresponding contribution to the Shannon entropy for analogous $2D$ $\textit{defect}$ replica field theories in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit, which govern the long-distance physics in the problem of performing weak $\textit{quantum}$ measurements on one-dimensional quantum critical ground states. Lastly, we discuss a possible consequence of our theorems for classical systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, according to which, under a certain assumption, and as opposed to problems with measurement-induced randomness, the corresponding universal quantities $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}$ and $g_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}$ in the $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit would $\textit{increase}$ under RG flow.</description>
