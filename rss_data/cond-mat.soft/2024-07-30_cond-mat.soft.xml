      <title>Closure to the PRISM equation derived from nonlinear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear response theory is employed to derive a closure to the polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) equation. The closure applies to a liquid of neutral polymers at melt densities. It can be considered a molecular generalization of the atomic mean spherical approximation (MSA) closure of Lebowitz and Percus, and is similar in some aspects to the "molecular" MSA of Schweizer and Yethiraj. The theory via the susceptibility route predicts a critical temperature for a binary blend of isotopic polyethylene that is in satisfactory quantitative agreement with experiment. Other properties are explored.</description>

      <title>Capillary sorting of fiber suspensions by dip coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sorting elongated anisotropic particles, such as fibers, dispersed in suspensions poses significant challenges as they present two characteristic dimensions: length and diameter. Fibers in suspension usually align with the flow, leading to diameter-based filtration when passing through a sieve. Modifying the flow conditions by introducing more mixing so that fibers are arbitrarily oriented can lead to sorting by diameter and length simultaneously, resulting in a lower filtration quality. In this paper, we demonstrate that capillary filtration by dip coating can be utilized to selectively sort fibers by length or by diameter in a controlled manner. Using the withdrawal of a flat substrate from a fiber suspension, we demonstrate that fibers are primarily sorted by their diameters. When considering cylindrical substrates, fibers can be sorted by length under appropriate conditions due to the orientation adopted by the fibers during their entrainment. We report guidelines for designing this filtration process and obtaining good sorting efficiency.</description>

      <title>Constrained motion of self-propelling eccentric disks linked by a spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been supposed that the interplay of elasticity and activity plays a key role in triggering the non-equilibrium behaviors in biological systems. However, the experimental model system is missing to investigate the spatiotemporally dynamical phenomena. Here, a model system of an active chain, where active eccentric-disks are linked by a spring, is designed to study the interplay of activity, elasticity, and friction. Individual active chain exhibits longitudinal and transverse motion, however, it starts to self-rotate when pinning one end, and self-beats when clamping one end. Additionally, our eccentric-disk model can qualitatively reproduce such behaviors and explain the unusual self-rotation of the first disk around its geometric center. Further, the structure and dynamics of long chains were studied via simulations without steric interactions. It was found that hairpin conformation emerges in free motion, while in the constrained motions, the rotational and beating frequencies scale with the flexure number (the ratio of self-propelling force to bending rigidity), ~4/3. Scaling analysis suggests that it results from the balance between activity and energy dissipation. Our findings show that topological constraints play a vital role in non-equilibrium synergy behavior.</description>

      <title>Escape of an Active Ring from an Attractive Surface: Behaving Like a Self-Propelled Brownian Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Escape of active agents from metastable states are of great current interest in statistical and biological physics. In this study, we find that a flexible active Brownian ring escapes from a flat attractive surface though two distinct mechanisms: Kramers-like thermal activation at large rotational diffusion coefficients, but with an effective temperature, and the first-passage process at small rotational diffusion coefficients. The escape time depends explicitly on the shape of potential barrier at large activity and small rotational diffusion coefficient. Moreover, when the propulsion force was biased along its contour, escape becomes more difficult and is primarily caused by thermal noise. Our findings highlight that, despite its intricate configuration, the active ring can be taken as an self-propelled Brownian particle when studying its escape from a smooth surface.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements ("soft spots"). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible, and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Solvent Quality and Nonbiological Oligomer Folding: Revisiting Conventional Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on extensive molecular dynamics atomistic simulations of a \textit{meta}-substituted \textit{poly}-phenylacetylene (pPA) foldamer dispersed in three solvents, water \ce{H2O}, cyclohexane \ce{cC6H12}, and \textit{n}-hexane \ce{nC6H14}, and for three oligomer lengths \textit{12mer}, \textit{16mer} and \textit{20mer}. At room temperature, we find a tendency of the pPA foldamer to collapse into a helical structure in all three solvents but with rather different stability character, stable in water, marginally stable in n-hexane, unstable in cyclohexane. In the case of water, the initial and final number of hydrogen bonds of the foldamer with water molecules is found to be unchanged, with no formation of intrachain hydrogen bonding, thus indicating that hydrogen bonding plays no role in the folding process. In all three solvents, the folding is found to be mainly driven by electrostatics, nearly identical in the three cases, and largely dominant compared to van der Waals interactions that are different in the three cases.
  This scenario is also supported by the analysis of distribution of the bond and dihedral angles and by a direct calculation of the solvation and transfer free energies via thermodynamic integration. The different stability in the case of cyclohexane and n-hexane notwithstanding their rather similar chemical composition can be traced back to the different entropy-enthalpy compensation that is found similar for water and n-hexane, and very different for cyclohexane.
  A comparison with the same properties for \textit{poly}-phenylalanine oligomers underscores the crucial differences between pPA and peptides.
  To highlight how these findings can hardly be interpreted in terms of a simple "good" and "poor" solvent picture, a molecular dynamics study of a bead-spring polymer chain in a Lennard-Jones fluid is also included.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Auxeticity and the Volume Phase Transition of Polymer Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoresponsive hydrogels exhibit reversible deswelling at the Volume Phase Transition (VPT), associated to a minimum of the Poisson's ratio $\nu$. Recent numerical investigations uncovered the occurrence of a Hyper-Auxetic Transition (HAT) ($\nu=-1$) for low-crosslinked hydrogels at low temperature, accompanied by a critical-like behavior. Here, we perform extensive numerical simulations to unveil the relation between these two transitions. We find that the HAT occurs at different temperatures $T$ up to a maximum value of the crosslinker concentration $c$, thus being clearly distinct from the VPT, taking place at fixed $T$ and for all $c$. Our results provide novel fundamental insights on the interplay between network collapse and mechanical properties of these fascinating materials.</description>

      <title>Planar network statistics for two-dimensional rupturing foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct experiments on a class of two-dimensional foams generated through compressing a three-dimensional soap foam between two glass plates. To induce a spatially uniform rupturing process on foam boundaries, an additional plate is heated and placed on top of the unheated plates. For 30 separate foam samples, we record network statistics related to cell side numbers and areas as the foam coarsens over a half-minute. We find that the Aboav law and a quadratic Lewis Law, two commonly used relations between network topology and geometry, hold well for preheated foams. To track how well these laws are maintained as the foam ages, we introduce metrics for measuring a foam's disorder over time and build simple autonomous models for these metrics. While the quadratic Lewis Law is found to hold well throughout the rupture process, the Aboav law breaks down rapidly when the Gini coefficient, used for measuring disparity of cell areas, is approximately .8.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Interlocking in Granular Jamming Grippers through Hard and Soft Particle Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of particle stiffness on the grasping performance of granular grippers, a class of soft robotic effectors that utilize granular jamming for object manipulation. Through experimental analyses and X-ray imaging, we show that grippers with soft particles exhibit improved wrapping of the object after jamming, in contrast to grippers with rigid particles. This results in significantly increased holding force through the interlocking. The addition of a small proportion of rigid particles into a predominantly soft particle mixture maintains the improved wrapping but also significantly increases the maximum holding force. These results suggest a tunable approach to optimizing the design of granular grippers for improved performance in soft robotics applications.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in short-range interacting nonreciprocal lattice systems without conservation laws. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Ghost states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws, which may be relevant e.g. for understanding enzyme clustering.</description>

      <title>Substrate stiffness modulates bacterial adhesion and diversity of adherent phenotypes across growth stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-adhesion and stiffness of underlying substrates mediate geometry, mechanics and self-organization of bacterial colonies. Recent studies have qualitatively indicted that stiffness may impact bacterial attachment, yet the variation of cell-to-surface adhesion with substrate stiffness remains to be quantified. Here, by developing a cell-level Force Distance Spectroscopy (FDS) technique based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), we simultaneously quantify the cell-surface adhesion alongside stiffness of the underlying substrates to reveal stiffness-dependent adhesion in phototrophic bacterium Chromatium okenii. As stiffness of the soft substrate, modelled via low-melting-point (LMP) agarose pad, was varied between 20 kPa and 120 kPa by changing agarose concentrations, we observe a progressive increase of the mean adhesion force by over an order of magnitude, from 0.21 (+/-0.10) nN to 2.42 (+/-1.16) nN. In contrast, passive polystyrene (PS) microparticles of comparable dimensions showed no perceptible change in their surface adhesion. Furthermore, for Escherichia coli, the cell-surface adhesion varied between 0.29 (+/-0.17) nN to 0.39 (+/-0.20) nN, showing a weak dependence on the substrate stiffness, thus suggesting that the stiffness-modulated adhesion is a species-specific trait. Finally, by quantifying the adhesion of C. okenii populations across growth stages, we report an emergent co-existence of weak and strongly adherent sub-populations, demonstrating a diversification of adherent phenotypes over time. Taken together, these findings suggest that bacteria, depending on the species and their physiological stage, actively modulate cell-to-surface adhesion in response to substrate stiffness, and leverage it as a functional trait to modulate initial attachment and colonization on soft substrates during early stages of biofilm development.</description>

      <title>Light-induced phase separation with finite wavelength selection in photophobic micro-algae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As for many motile micro-algae, the freshwater species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can detect light sources and adapt its motile behavior in response. Here, we show that suspensions of photophobic cells can be unstable to density fluctuations, as a consequence of shading interactions mediated by light absorption. In a circular illumination geometry this mechanism leads to the complete phase separation of the system into transient branching patterns, providing the first experimental evidence of finite wavelength selection in an active phase-separating system without birth and death processes. The finite wavelength selection, that can be captured in a simple drift-diffusion framework, is a consequence of a vision-based interaction length scale set by the illumination geometry and depends on global cell density, light intensity and medium viscosity. Finally we show that this active phase separation shields individual cells from the deleterious effects of high light intensity, demonstrating that phototaxis can efficiently contribute to photoprotection through collective behaviors on short timescales.</description>

      <title>Nature of barriers determine first passage times in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intuition suggests that passage times across a region increases with the number of barriers along the path. Can this fail depending on the nature of the barrier? To probe this fundamental question, we exactly solve for the first passage time in general d-dimensions for diffusive transport through a spatially patterned array of obstacles - either entropic or energetic, depending on the nature of the obstacles. For energetic barriers, we show that first passage times vary non-monotonically with the number of barriers, while for entropic barriers it increases monotonically. This non-monotonicity for energetic barriers further reflects in the behaviour of effective diffusivity as well. We then design a simple experiment where a robotic bug navigates a heterogeneous environment through a spatially patterned array of obstacles to validate our predictions. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show that this non-monotonic behaviour for energetic barriers is general and extends to even super-diffusive transport.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough-Induced Loop Formation in Evolving Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport networks, such as vasculature or river networks, provide key functions in organisms and the environment. They usually contain loops whose significance for the stability and robustness of the network is well documented. However, the dynamics of their formation is usually not considered. Such structures often grow in response to the gradient of an external field. During evolution, extending branches compete for the available flux of the field, which leads to effective repulsion between them and screening of the shorter ones. Yet, in remarkably diverse processes, from unstable fluid flows to the canal system of jellyfish, loops suddenly form near the breakthrough when the longest branch reaches the boundary of the system. We provide a physical explanation for this universal behavior. Using a 1D model, we explain that the appearance of effective attractive forces results from the field drop inside the leading finger as it approaches the outlet. Furthermore, we numerically study the interactions between two fingers, including screening in the system and its disappearance near the breakthrough. Finally, we perform simulations of the temporal evolution of the fingers to show how revival and attraction to the longest finger leads to dynamic loop formation. We compare the simulations to the experiments and find that the dynamics of the shorter finger are well reproduced. Our results demonstrate that reconnection is a prevalent phenomenon in systems driven by diffusive fluxes, occurring both when the ratio of the mobility inside the growing structure to the mobility outside is low and near the breakthrough.</description>
