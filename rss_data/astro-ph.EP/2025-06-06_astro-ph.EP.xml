      <title>Planet Earth in reflected and polarized light: II. Refining contrast estimates for rocky exoplanets with ELT and HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of nearby rocky exoplanets will become feasible with the next generation of telescopes, such as the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) and the mission concept Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Using an improved model setup, we aim to refine the estimates of reflected and polarized light contrast for a selected sample of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. We perform advanced 3D radiative transfer simulations for Earth-like planets orbiting G-type and M-type stars. Our simulations incorporate realistic, wavelength-dependent surface albedo maps and a detailed cloud treatment, including 3D cloud structures and inhomogeneities, to better capture their radiative response. These improvements are based on Earth observations. We present models of increasing complexity, ranging from simple homogeneous representations to a detailed Earth-as-an-exoplanet model. Our results show that averaging homogeneous models fails to capture Earth's full complexity, especially in polarization. Moreover, simplistic cloud models distort the representation of absorption lines at high spectral resolutions, particularly in water bands, potentially biasing atmospheric chemical abundance estimates. Additionally, we provide updated contrast estimates for observing rocky exoplanets around nearby stars with upcoming instruments such as ANDES and PCS at the ELT. Compared to previous studies, our results indicate that reflected light contrast estimates are overestimated by a factor of two when simplified cloud and surface models are used. Instead, measuring the fractional polarization in the continuum and in high-contrast, high-resolution spectra may be more effective for characterizing nearby Earth-like exoplanets. These refined estimates are essential for guiding the design of future ELT instruments and the HWO mission concept.</description>

      <title>Modelling shadows in scattered light observations as signals from companions in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, SPHERE scattered light observations of protoplanetary discs have revealed previously unseen features with unprecedented resolution. One such feature are radial streaks of reduced brightness that are commonly interpreted as shadows. A possible cause for these shadows is an embedded companion within the disc. In this work, we use 3D radiative transfer simulations with RADMC-3D to investigate the shadowing effects of embedded companions across a range of orbital distances (5-30 au) and companion masses (0.5-30 Jupiter masses). We model 0.1 $\mu$m dust grains, which are well-coupled to the gas, to produce synthetic scattered light images of the disc. Companions with masses equal to or greater than 14 Jupiter masses consistently cast detectable shadows throughout the disc. We hence derive an empirical solution to describe the width and depth of the shadow as functions of companion mass and location. This scaling suggests that shadow features observed in scattered light images could serve as reliable indicators of companion mass and position, providing an indirect method for identifying and characterising otherwise challenging-to-detect objects within these discs. Additionally, our analysis reveals that companion shadows influence the disc thermal structure, with notable cooling effects that could impact disc chemistry and the dynamics of planet formation.</description>

      <title>The Age and High Energy Environment of the Very Young Transiting Exoplanet TOI 1227b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-M star TOI~1227 hosts among the youngest known transiting exoplanets. We have conducted new X-ray imaging and optical spectroscopic observations of TOI 1227 aimed at ascertaining its age and the influence of its high-energy radiation on the exoplanet, TOI 1227b. We obtained a definitive X-ray detection of TOI 1227 with Chandra/HRC-I, and measured its Li and H$\alpha$ lines using ANU SSO 2.3 m telescope (WiFeS) spectroscopy. Through spatiokinematic, isochronal, and SED-based modeling, we have constrained the age of TOI 1227 as lying between 5 Myr and 12 Myr, with a best estimate of $\sim$8 Myr. In the context of this age, we model the evolution of the transiting exoplanet TOI 1227b, using the X-ray luminosity derived from Chandra HRC-I imaging. Our modeling suggests that TOI 1227b is currently undergoing rapid atmospheric mass loss at rates on the order of $\sim 10^{12}$ g s$^{-1}$. The modeling demonstrates that the exoplanet's predicted future evolution depends sensitively on assumptions for total and core planet mass, highlighting the importance of follow-up observations of the TOI 1227 star-exoplanet system to enable measurements of both planetary mass and mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Centaur Nuclei: Sizes, Shapes, Spins, and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wide-ranging but in-depth analysis of Centaurs, focusing on their physical and structural aspects. Centaurs, originating from the Scattered Disk and Kuiper Belt, play a crucial role in our understanding of Solar System evolution. We first examine how biases in discovery and measurement affect our understanding of the Centaur size distribution. In particular we address the strong dependence of the census on perihelion distance and the broad distribution of Centaur geometric albedos. We explore the rotational characteristics derived from lightcurves, revealing a diverse range of spin rates and photometric variabilities, with most Centaurs showing low amplitude lightcurves, suggesting near-spherical shapes. Additionally, we investigate the relationships between Centaur orbital parameters, surface colors, and physical properties, noting a lack of correlation between rotational dynamics and orbital evolution. We also address the influence of sublimation-driven activity on Centaur spin states, and the rarity of contact binaries. We then discuss some observational and modeling limitations from using common observations (e.g. visible or infrared photometry) to determine diameters and shapes. Following that, we give some points on understanding how Centaur diameters and shapes can reveal the `primitive' nature of the bodies, emphasizing the important role occultation observations play. We also then assess how the Centaur size distribution we see today has been influenced by the collisions in both the primordial Kuiper Belt and in the subsequent Scattered Disk. Finally, we end the chapter with a short narrative of future prospects for overcoming our current limitations in understanding Centaur origins and evolution.</description>

      <title>Radio prospects of extrasolar aurorae polaris as a probe of planetary magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetized exoplanets are expected to emit auroral cyclotron radiation in the radio regime due to the interactions between their magnetospheres, the interplanetary magnetic field, and the stellar wind. Prospective extrasolar auroral emission detections will constrain the magnetic properties of exoplanets, allowing the assessment of the planets' habitability and their protection against atmospheric escape by photoevaporation, enhancing our understanding of exoplanet formation and demographics. We construct a numerical model to update the estimates of radio emission characteristics of the confirmed exoplanets while quantifying the uncertainties of our predictions for each system by implementing a Monte Carlo error propagation method. We identify 16 candidates that have expected emission characteristics that render them potentially detectable from current ground-based telescopes. Among these, the hot Jupiter tau Bootis b is the most favorable target with an expected flux density of $51^{+36}_{-22}$ mJy. Notably, eleven candidates are super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, for which magnetism is key to understanding the associated demographics. Together with the other predictive works in the literature regarding the characteristics and the geometry of the magnetospheric emissions, our predictions are expected to guide observational campaigns in pursuit of discovering magnetism on exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Searching for helium escape and a low density atmosphere around the 120 Myr old sub-Neptune HIP94235b using CRIRES+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric mass loss is thought to induce the bimodality in the small planet population as we observe it today. Observationally, active mass loss can be traced by excess absorption in spectral lines of lighter species, such as the hydrogen Ly-alpha line and the metastable helium triplet. We search for helium escape from the young (120Myr old) sub-Neptune HIP94235b. We obtained two transit observations of HIP94235b using the CRyogenic InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES+) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We find no evidence for escaping helium across both visits, allowing us to place a mass loss rate upper limit of 10^11 g/s, based on 1D Parker wind models. Additionally, we search for molecular spectral features in the planet's transmission spectrum, and cross-correlate our observations with high-resolution template spectra for H2O, the dominating molecule in the Y-band. We detect no significant absorption. We demonstrate that some atmosphere models at 10x solar metallicity would have been retrievable if present. Through the null detection of neutral hydrogen and helium escape, we conclude the atmosphere of HIP94235b likely lacks a large hydrogen-helium envelope. This is consistent with the expectation of small planet photoevaporation models, which suggest most planets lose their primordial hydrogen-helium envelopes within 100Myr of evolution.</description>

      <title>Three Hot Jupiters transiting K-dwarfs with a significant heavy element mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Albeit at a lower frequency than around hotter stars, short-period gas giants around low-mass stars ($T_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 4965$ K) do exist, despite predictions from planetary population synthesis models that such systems should be exceedingly rare. By combining data from TESS and ground-based follow-up observations, we seek to confirm and characterize giant planets transiting K dwarfs, particularly mid/late K dwarfs. Photometric data were obtained from the TESS mission, supplemented by ground-based imaging- and photometric observations, as well as high-resolution spectroscopic data from the CORALIE spectrograph. Radial velocity (RV) measurements were analyzed to confirm the presence of companions. We report the confirmation and characterization of three giants transiting mid-K dwarfs. Within the TOI-2969 system, a giant planet of $1.16\pm 0.04\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ and a radius of $1.10 \pm 0.08\,R_\mathrm{Jup}$ revolves around its K3V host in 1.82 days. The system of TOI-2989 contains a $3.0 \pm 0.2\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ giant with a radius of $1.12 \pm 0.05\,R_\mathrm{Jup}$, which orbits its K4V host in 3.12 days. The K4V TOI-5300 hosts a giant of $0.6 \pm 0.1\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ with a radius of $0.88 \pm 0.08\,R_\mathrm{Jup}$ and an orbital period of 2.3 days. The equilibrium temperatures of the companions range from 1001 to 1186 K, classifying them as Hot Jupiters. However, they do not present radius inflation. The estimated heavy element masses in their interior, inferred from the mass, radius, and evolutionary models, are $90 \pm 30\,M_\oplus$, $114 \pm 30\,M_\oplus$, and $84 \pm 21\,M_\oplus$, respectively. The heavy element masses are significantly higher than most reported heavy elements for K-dwarf Hot Jupiters. These mass characterizations contribute to the poorly explored population of massive companions around low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Planets similar in size are often dissimilar in interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have found evidence of significant intrasystem uniformity in planet properties such as radius, mass, and orbital spacing, collectively termed 'peas in a pod' trends. In particular, correlations in radius and mass have been interpreted as implying uniformity in planet bulk density and composition within a system. However, the samples used to assess trends in mass tend to be small and biased. In this paper, we re-evaluate correlations in planet properties in a large sample of systems with at least two planets for which mass and radius have been directly measured, and therefore bulk density can be calculated. Our sample was assembled using the most up-to-date exoplanet catalogue data, and we compute the relevant statistics while using a procedure to 'weight' the data points according to measurement precision. We find a moderate correlation in radius and a weak correlation in the densities of adjacent planets. However, masses of neighbouring planets show no overall correlation in our main sample and a weak correlation among pairs of planets similar in size or pairs restricted to Mp&lt;100 M_Earth, Rp&lt;10 R_Earth. Similarly, we show that the intrasystem dispersion in radius is typically less than that in mass and density. We identify ranges in stellar host properties that correlate with stronger uniformity in pairs of adjacent planets: low Teff for planet masses, and low metallicity and old age for planet densities. Furthermore, we explore whether peas in a pod trends extend into planet compositions or interior structures. For small neighbouring planets with similar radii, we show that their masses and interior structures are often disparate, indicating that even within the same system, similarity in radii is not necessarily a good proxy for similarity in composition or the physical nature of the planets.</description>

      <title>A Disintegrating Rocky World Shrouded in Dust and Gas: Mid-IR Observations of K2-22b using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disintegrating ultra-short period rocky exoplanet K2-22b periodically emits dusty clouds in a dynamically chaotic process resulting in a variable transit depth from 0-1.3%. The effluents that sublimate off the surface and condense out in space are probably representative of the formerly interior layers convectively transported to the molten surface. Transmission spectroscopy of these transiting clouds reveal spectral fingerprints of the interior composition of this rocky world. We used JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) as a low-resolution slitless spectrograph to observe four predicted transit windows for K2-22b. For each observation, we extracted a transmission spectrum over the spectral range of 4.4-11.8 $\mu$m. Over the spectral range of 4.4-8 $\mu$m, where the spectral precision is highest, we detect one transit at high significance and two at low significance. While the S/N of the spectrum limits our ability to draw firm conclusions, we find that the data: 1) disfavor featureless, iron-dominated core material, 2) are consistent with some form of magnesium silicate minerals, likely from mantle material, and 3) show a distinct and unexpected feature at $\sim$5 $\mu$m. The unexpected feature, also seen weakly in the low-significance transits, is consistent with an unknown gaseous absorber, possibly NO and/or CO$_2$. These findings warrant further study to improve the constraints on the composition of this disintegrating rocky world.</description>

      <title>Tracing the formation and migration history: molecular signatures in the atmosphere of misaligned hot Jupiter WASP-94Ab using JWST NIRSpec/G395H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their host stars has long challenged traditional models of planetary formation and migration. Characterising their atmospheric composition - mainly in the form of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity - can provide insights into their formation locations and evolution pathways. With JWST we can characterise the atmospheres of these types of planets more precisely than previously possible, primarily because it allows us to determine both their atmospheric oxygen and carbon composition. Here, we present a JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum from 2.8-5.1$\mu m$ of WASP-94Ab, an inflated hot Jupiter with a retrograde misaligned orbit around its F-type host star. We find a relatively cloud-free atmosphere, with absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ at detection significances of $\sim 4\sigma$ and $\sim 11\sigma$, respectively. In addition, we detect tentative evidence of CO absorption at $\sim3\sigma$, as well as hints of sulphur with the detection of H$_2$S at a $\sim 2.5\sigma$ confidence level. Our favoured equilibrium chemistry model determines a C/O ratio of $0.49^{+0.08}_{-0.13}$ for WASP-94Ab's atmosphere, which is substellar compared to the star's C/O ratio of $0.68 \pm 0.10$. The retrieved atmospheric metallicity is similar to the star's metallicity as both are $\sim 2\times$ solar. We find that this sub-stellar C/O ratio and stellar metallicity can be best explained by pebble accretion or planetesimal accretion in combination with large-distance migration of the planet.</description>

      <title>Cloud and Haze Parameterization in Atmospheric Retrievals: Insights from Titan's Cassini Data and JWST Observations of Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Before JWST, telescope observations were not sensitive enough to constrain the nature of clouds in exo-atmospheres. Recent observations, however, have inferred cloud signatures as well as haze-enhanced scattering slopes motivating the need for modern inversion techniques and a deeper understanding of the JWST information content.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the information content of JWST exoplanet spectra. We particularly focus on designing an inversion technique able to handle a wide range of cloud and hazes.
  Methods: We build a flexible aerosol parameterization within the TauREx framework, enabling us to conduct atmospheric retrievals of planetary atmospheres. The method is evaluated on available Cassini occultations of Titan. We then use the model to interpret the recent JWST data for the prototypical hot Jupiters HAT-P-18 b, WASP-39 b, WASP-96 b, and WASP-107 b. In parallel, we perform complementary simulations on controlled scenarios to further understand the information content of JWST data and provide parameterization guidelines.
  Results: Our results use free and kinetic chemistry retrievals to extract the main atmospheric properties of key JWST exoplanets, including their molecular abundances, thermal structures, and aerosol properties. In our investigations, we show the need for a wide wavelength coverage to robustly characterize clouds and hazes-which is necessary to mitigate biases arising from our lack of priors on their composition-and break degeneracies with atmospheric chemical composition. With JWST, the characterization of clouds and hazes might be difficult due to the lack of simultaneous wavelength coverage from visible to mid-infrared by a single instruments and the likely presence of temporal variability between visits (from e.g., observing conditions, instrument systematics, stellar host variability, or planetary weather).</description>

      <title>Predictions of the LSST Solar System Yield: Discovery Rates and Characterizations of Centaurs</title>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will start by the end of 2025 and operate for ten years, offering billions of observations of the southern night sky. One of its main science goals is to create an inventory of the Solar System, allowing for a more detailed understanding of small body populations including the Centaurs, which will benefit from the survey's high cadence and depth. In this paper, we establish the first discovery limits for Centaurs throughout the LSST's decade-long operation using the best available dynamical models. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, we predict a $\sim$7-12 fold increase in Centaurs in the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database, reaching $\sim$1200-2000 (dependent on definition) by the end of the survey - about 50$\%$ of which are expected within the first 2 years. Approximately 30-50 Centaurs will be observed twice as frequently as they fall within one of the LSST's Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) for on average only up to two months. Outside of the DDFs, Centaurs will receive $\sim$200 observations across the $\textit{ugrizy}$ filter range, facilitating searches for cometary-like activity through PSF extension analysis, as well as fitting light-curves and phase curves for color determination. Regardless of definition, over 200 Centaurs will achieve high-quality color measurements across at least three filters in the LSST's six filters. These observations will also provide over 300 well-defined phase curves in the $\textit{griz}$ bands, improving absolute magnitude measurements to a precision of 0.2 mags.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>
