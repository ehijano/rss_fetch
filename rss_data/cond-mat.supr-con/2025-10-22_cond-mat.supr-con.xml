      <title>Helical phases and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces probed by superconducting diode effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and in-plane magnetic fields have emerged as natural platforms for realizing both the bulk superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) - phenomena characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions due to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism, we systematically investigate both the bulk SDE and the JDE in a clean NCS with Rashba SOC and in-plane magnetic fields. For the bulk system, we find that the diode efficiency can nominally approach its maximal value at the critical endpoint of the first-order Lifshitz transition between weak and strong helical phases featuring finite-momentum Cooper pairs, the latter marked by the emergence of Bogolyubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). In a Josephson junction, we show that finite-momentum pairing in the superconducting leads is the dominant mechanism behind the JDE in short junctions, whereas in long junctions it is primarily governed by the Zeeman field in the normal region. In the long-junction regime, the diode efficiency additionally oscillates between positive and negative values as a function of magnetic field at low fields, providing a route toward a highly tunable Josephson diode. At higher fields, the onset of BFSs in the strong helical phase leads to a sharp suppression of both the JDE and the Josephson current when the current direction is aligned with momenta along the BFS, resulting in strong anisotropy. We propose that this anisotropy in the Josephson current offers an alternative method for detecting BFSs, applicable to systems with or without a JDE.</description>

      <title>The Superconducting Transition due to the spontaneous Interlayer Loop Current fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop currents, as an orbital magnetism, have been proposed as a possible fluctuation mechanism for superconducting pairing, which always remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</description>

      <title>Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy of layered superconductors with device-integrated diamond anvil cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors that can be mechanically exfoliated are an interesting platform for exploring superconducting properties tuned by layer thickness. These layered superconductors are also expected to exhibit sensitivity to applied pressure. While pressure has been demonstrated to be an effective way of tuning bulk superconductors, analogous studies on superconducting thin flakes have been limited due to technical challenges. In particular, spectroscopic measurements under pressure remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we functionalized the diamond anvil cell technique for point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy (PCAR) measurement on thin-flake materials under pressure, offering the opportunity to obtain spectroscopic information on superconductivity. To validate the feasibility of this method, we have conducted PCAR measurements on iron-selenide thin flakes to extract temperature-dependent superconducting gap values under ambient and high pressure. Combine with the proven magnetotransport capability, our method provides a conceptually simple tool for a detailed examination of thin-flake superconductors under pressure.</description>

      <title>Soft Mode Origin of Charge Ordering in Superconducting Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity coexist in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Cs, Rb), raising fundamental questions about the mechanisms driving their intertwined phases. Here we combine high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis, we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition, our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity from altermagnetic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) fluctuations are a new class of collinear spin fluctuations whose role in mediating superconductivity faces a fundamental tension: their $\Gamma$-point peak favors intra-orbital spin-triplet pairing, while their spin compensation favors inter-orbital singlets. Here, we demonstrate that inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations generically resolve this competition in favor of spin-triplet pairing. As a proof of concept, we study a minimal two-orbital model with two van Hove singularities. The broken inversion symmetry induces momentum-orbital locking: the same orbital dominates at opposite momenta, enhancing the triplet channel. Crucially, a subdominant fluctuation channel arising from inter-van-Hove nesting provides an internal Josephson coupling that locks the phase difference between triplet pairs on different orbitals. We find this coupling changes sign ($+$ to $-$) upon a crossover from AM-dominant to ferromagnetic-dominant fluctuations. The resulting $\pi$-phase difference manifests as a $\tau_z$-type order parameter, $c_{k,1\uparrow}c_{-k,1\uparrow} - c_{k,2\uparrow}c_{-k,2\uparrow}$. Although intra-orbital in the original basis, its orbital-nontrivial character, as manifested by its equivalence to inter-orbital pairing under rotation, defines a general \textit{inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity}. This state is distinct from the $\tau_0$-triplet pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, as evidenced by the canceled intra-orbital supercurrent in a Josephson junction between them.</description>

      <title>The Eckhaus instability: from initial to final stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the Eckhaus instability in the one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. The analysis is based on numerical integration of the equation in a large (xt)-domain. The initial conditions correspond to a stationary, unstable spatially periodic solution perturbed by "noise." The latter consists of a set of spatially periodic modes with small amplitudes and random phases. The evolution of the solution is examined by analyzing and comparing the dynamics of three key characteristics: the solution itself, its spatial spectrum, and the value of the Lyapunov functional. All calculations exhibit four distinct, mutually agreed, well-defined regimes: (i) rapid decay of stable perturbations; (ii) latent changes, when the solution and the Lyapunov functional undergo minimal alterations while the Fourier spectrum concentrates around the most unstable perturbations; (iii) a phase-slip period, characterized by a sharp decrease in the Lyapunov functional; (iv) slow relaxation to a final stable state.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent diode with high winding vortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04421v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal supercurrent refers to the phenomenon where the maximum dissipationless current in a superconductor depends on its direction of flow. This asymmetry underlies the operation of superconducting diodes and is often associated with the presence of vortices. Here, we investigate supercurrent nonreciprocal effects in a superconducting weak-link hosting distinct types of vortices. We demonstrate how the winding number of the vortex, its spatial configuration, and the shape of the superconducting lead can steer the sign and amplitude of the supercurrent rectification. We identify a general criterion for optimizing the rectification amplitude based on vortex patterns, focusing on configurations where the first harmonic of the supercurrent vanishes. We prove that supercurrent nonreciprocal effects can be used to diagnose high-winding vortex and to distinguish between different types of vorticity. Our results provide a toolkit for controlling supercurrent rectification through vortex phase textures and detecting unconventional vortex states.</description>

      <title>Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects.</description>

      <title>Composite Superconducting Orders and Magnetism in CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally noncentrosymmetric materials are attracting significant attention due to the unique phenomena associated with sublattice degrees of freedom. The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as a compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its remarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a field-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition with nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as well as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To investigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we develop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with Bogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose probable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close relationship with magnetism. Among other results, we find that the near degeneracy of two pairing symmetries is naturally explained if and only if intralayer spin-orbit coupling is large compared to interlayer hopping. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order transition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the same superconducting order parameters, albeit with distinct admixtures. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting critical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental phase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the superconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these quantities to recent experimental results.</description>

Abstract: We show that interacting electrons in a flat Chern band can form, in addition to fractional Chern insulators, a chiral $f$-wave topological superconductor that hosts neutral Majorana fermion edge modes. Superconductivity emerges from an interaction-induced metallic state that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, as observed in rhombohedral graphene and near the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Tunneling conductance in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnets breaking time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new type of magnet called $p$-wave unconventional magnet is proposed, stimulated by the discovery of altermagnet. We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the missing of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\ Phys.\ Soc.\ Jpn.\ \textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity governed by Janus-faced fermiology in strained bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $\gamma$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</description>

      <title>Interplay of competing bond-order and loop-current fluctuations as a possible mechanism for superconductivity in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry and underlying mechanism for superconducting state of AV${}_3$Sb${}_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) kagome metal has been a topic of intense investigation. In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</description>

      <title>The Meissner effect in superconductors: emergence versus reductionism</title>

Abstract: The Meissner effect, the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a metal entering the superconducting state, is arguably the most fundamental property of superconductors, discovered in 1933. The conventional theory of superconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the Meissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus, rooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there are questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field expulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a reductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be resolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory, namely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition process. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where motion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We review how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer between electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge motion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications regarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to search for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures. Therefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important.</description>

      <title>Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</description>
