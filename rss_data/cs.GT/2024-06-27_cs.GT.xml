      <title>The Impact of Autonomous Vehicles on Ride-Hailing Platforms with Strategic Human Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid development of autonomous vehicle technology, this work focuses on the challenges of introducing them in ride-hailing platforms with conventional strategic human drivers. We consider a ride-hailing platform that operates a mixed fleet of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and conventional vehicles (CVs), where AVs are fully controlled by the platform and CVs are operated by self-interested human drivers. Each vehicle is modelled as a Markov Decision Process that maximizes long-run average reward by choosing its repositioning actions. The behavior of the CVs corresponds to a large game where agents interact through resource constraints that result in queuing delays. In our fluid model, drivers may wait in queues in the different regions when the supply of drivers tends to exceed the service demand by customers. Our primary objective is to optimize the mixed AV-CV system so that the total profit of the platform generated by AVs and CVs is maximized. To achieve that, we formulate this problem as a bi-level optimization problem OPT where the platform moves first by controlling the actions of the AVs and the demand revealed to CVs, and then the CVs react to the revealed demand by forming an equilibrium that can be characterized by the solution of a convex optimization problem. We prove several interesting structural properties of the optimal solution and analyze simple heuristics such as AV-first where we solve for the optimal dispatch of AVs without taking into account the subsequent reaction of the CVs. We propose three numerical algorithms to solve OPT which is a non-convex problem in the platform decision parameters. We evaluate their performance and use them to show some interesting trends in the optimal AV-CV fleet dimensioning when supply is exogenous and endogenous.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Structured Coordination Game with Neutral Options through Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordination games have been of interest to game theorists, economists, and ecologists for many years to study such problems as the emergence of local conventions and the evolution of cooperative behavior. Approaches for understanding the coordination game with discrete structure have been limited in scope, often relying on symmetric reduction of the state space, or other constraints which limit the power of the model to give insight into desired applications. In this paper, we introduce a new way of thinking about equilibria of the structured coordination game with neutral strategies by means of graph partitioning. We begin with a few elementary game theoretical results and then catalogue all the Nash equilibria of the coordination game with neutral options for graphs with seven or fewer vertices. We extend our observations through the use of simulation on larger Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs to form the basis for proposing some conjectures about the general relationships among edge density, cluster number, and consensus stability.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Analysis of Autobidding Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has become the default in markets such as ad auctions for participants to bid in an auction through automated bidding agents (autobidders) which adjust bids over time to satisfy return-over-spend constraints. Despite the prominence of such systems for the internet economy, their resulting dynamical behavior is still not well understood. Although one might hope that such relatively simple systems would typically converge to the equilibria of their underlying auctions, we provide a plethora of results that show the emergence of complex behavior, such as bi-stability, periodic orbits and quasi periodicity. We empirically observe how the market structure (expressed as motifs) qualitatively affects the behavior of the dynamics. We complement it with theoretical results showing that autobidding systems can simulate both linear dynamical systems as well logical boolean gates.</description>

      <title>Competitive Algorithms for Online Knapsack with Succinct Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the online knapsack problem, the goal is to pack items arriving online with different values and weights into a capacity-limited knapsack to maximize the total value of the accepted items. We study \textit{learning-augmented} algorithms for this problem, which aim to use machine-learned predictions to move beyond pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Existing learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack consider relatively complicated prediction models that give an algorithm substantial information about the input, such as the total weight of items at each value. In practice, such predictions can be error-sensitive and difficult to learn. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a family of learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack that use \emph{succinct predictions}. In particular, the machine-learned prediction given to the algorithm is just a single value or interval that estimates the minimum value of any item accepted by an offline optimal solution. By leveraging a relaxation to online \emph{fractional} knapsack, we design algorithms that can leverage such succinct predictions in both the trusted setting (i.e., with perfect prediction) and the untrusted setting, where we prove that a simple meta-algorithm achieves a nearly optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. Empirically, we show that our algorithms significantly outperform baselines that do not use predictions and often outperform algorithms based on more complex prediction models.</description>

      <title>Online Stackelberg Optimization via Nonlinear Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In repeated interaction problems with adaptive agents, our objective often requires anticipating and optimizing over the space of possible agent responses. We show that many problems of this form can be cast as instances of online (nonlinear) control which satisfy \textit{local controllability}, with convex losses over a bounded state space which encodes agent behavior, and we introduce a unified algorithmic framework for tractable regret minimization in such cases. When the instance dynamics are known but otherwise arbitrary, we obtain oracle-efficient $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret by reduction to online convex optimization, which can be made computationally efficient if dynamics are locally \textit{action-linear}. In the presence of adversarial disturbances to the state, we give tight bounds in terms of either the cumulative or per-round disturbance magnitude (for \textit{strongly} or \textit{weakly} locally controllable dynamics, respectively). Additionally, we give sublinear regret results for the cases of unknown locally action-linear dynamics as well as for the bandit feedback setting. Finally, we demonstrate applications of our framework to well-studied problems including performative prediction, recommendations for adaptive agents, adaptive pricing of real-valued goods, and repeated gameplay against no-regret learners, directly yielding extensions beyond prior results in each case.</description>

      <title>A Treatment of EIP-1559: Enhancing Transaction Fee Mechanism through Nth-Price Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, the transaction fee mechanism (TFM) in blockchain systems has become a prominent research topic. An ideal TFM should satisfy user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and miner-user side contract proofness ($c$-SCP). However, state-of-the-art works either fail to meet these three properties simultaneously or only satisfy them under certain conditions. In this paper, we propose a burning $N$-price auction TFM named BNP. This mechanism divides the transaction fee into a base fee, which is burned, and a priority fee, which is allocated to miners. Theoretical proofs and experimental analyses demonstrate that, even under conditions of significant transaction congestion, this mechanism satisfies UIC, MIC, and $c$-SCP simultaneously. Furthermore, the BNP mechanism is not constrained by the type of blockchain consensus, making it widely applicable.</description>

      <title>Equilibria, Efficiency, and Inequality in Network Formation for Hiring and Opportunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Professional networks -- the social networks among people in a given line of work -- can serve as a conduit for job prospects and other opportunities. Here we propose a model for the formation of such networks and the transfer of opportunities within them. In our theoretical model, individuals strategically connect with others to maximize the probability that they receive opportunities from them. We explore how professional networks balance connectivity, where connections facilitate opportunity transfers to those who did not get them from outside sources, and congestion, where some individuals receive too many opportunities from their connections and waste some of them.
  We show that strategic individuals are over-connected at equilibrium relative to a social optimum, leading to a price of anarchy for which we derive nearly tight asymptotic bounds. We also show that, at equilibrium, individuals form connections to those who provide similar benefit to them as they provide to others. Thus, our model provides a microfoundation in professional networking contexts for the fundamental sociological principle of homophily, that "similarity breeds connection," which in our setting is realized as a form of status homophily based on alignment in individual benefit. We further explore how, even if individuals are a priori equally likely to receive opportunities from outside sources, equilibria can be unequal, and we provide nearly tight bounds on how unequal they can be. Finally, we explore the ability for online platforms to intervene to improve social welfare and show that natural heuristics may result in adverse effects at equilibrium. Our simple model allows for a surprisingly rich analysis of coordination problems in professional networks and suggests many directions for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Winner-Pays-Bid Auctions Minimize Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any social choice function (e.g the efficient allocation) can be implemented using different payment rules: first price, second price, all-pay, etc. All of these payment rules are guaranteed to have the same expected revenue by the revenue equivalence theorem, but have different distributions of revenue, leading to a question of which one is best. We prove that among all possible payment rules, winner-pays-bid minimizes the variance in revenue and, in fact, minimizes any convex risk measure.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Strategy Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>
