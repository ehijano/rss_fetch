      <title>Phycobilisome core architecture influences photoprotective quenching by the Orange Carotenoid Protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthetic organisms rely on sophisticated photoprotective mechanisms to prevent oxidative damage under high or fluctuating solar illumination. Cyanobacteria, which have evolved a modular, water-soluble light harvesting complex - the phycobilisome - achieve photoprotection through a unique, photoactivatable quencher called the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Although phycobiliproteins are highly conserved, phycobilisomes take on different macromolecular architectures in different species of cyanobacteria, and it is not well understood whether or how these structures relate to changes in photoprotective function. To learn whether OCP functions similarly across species with different core architectures, we experimentally compare the photophysical states accessible to prototypical tricylindrical and pentacylindrical phycobilisomes, with and without OCP, at the single-molecule level using an Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trap. We compare our data to Monte Carlo simulations of exciton transfer in compartmental models of phycobilisomes with OCP bound at different combinations of predicted docking sites. Our results suggest that while some aspects of OCP function are influenced by phycobilisome architecture, others are surprisingly well-conserved: OCP appears to bind at different locations in each architecture and cross-species OCP-phycobilisome compatibility is asymmetric, yet the quenching strength and dimeric binding of OCP appear to be similar for both phycobilisome architectures. Together, our findings provide new insights into how the uniquely modular architecture of phycobilisomes enables robust conservation as well as fine-tuning of the OCP quenching mechanism across species.</description>

      <title>Scaling Graph Neural Networks to Large Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) architectures have emerged as promising force field models, exhibiting high accuracy in predicting complex energies and forces based on atomic identities and Cartesian coordinates. To expand the applicability of GNNs, and machine learning force fields more broadly, optimizing their computational efficiency is critical, especially for large biomolecular systems in classical molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, we address key challenges in existing GNN benchmarks by introducing a dataset, DISPEF, which comprises large, biologically relevant proteins. DISPEF includes 207,454 proteins with sizes up to 12,499 atoms and features diverse chemical environments, spanning folded and disordered regions. The implicit solvation free energies, used as training targets, represent a particularly challenging case due to their many-body nature, providing a stringent test for evaluating the expressiveness of machine learning models. We benchmark the performance of seven GNNs on DISPEF, emphasizing the importance of directly accounting for long-range interactions to enhance model transferability. Additionally, we present a novel multiscale architecture, termed Schake, which delivers transferable and computationally efficient energy and force predictions for large proteins. Our findings offer valuable insights and tools for advancing GNNs in protein modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Neutral polymer conformations with attractive bridging crowder interactions: role of crowder size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the conformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the presence of attractive crowders of varying sizes. For weakly self-attractive polymers, larger crowders induce a transition from an extended state to a bridging-crowder-induced collapse (CB phase) at lower polymer-crowder interaction strengths. Similarly, for strongly self-attractive polymers, a transition from a crowder-excluded collapse (CI phase) to the CB phase occurs with larger crowders and stronger polymer-crowder attraction. The simulations reveal that the collapsed states in both weakly and strongly self-attractive polymers are identical when small bridging crowders are involved. Near the transition threshold for weakly self-attractive polymers, increasing crowder size leads to complex transitions, including collapse, extension, and re-collapse. Additionally, a confined collapse (CC phase) is observed, where the polymer is confined to interstitial spaces among large crowders. Strongly self-attractive polymers show similar transitions, but only with smaller crowders, as larger crowders suppress these changes. These findings underscore the crucial influence of crowder size on the conformational behavior of neutral polymers, especially under varying degrees of polymer-crowder interaction.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Instabilities of Blood Flow in a Model Capillary Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of multiple blood flow configurations in a relatively simple microfluidic network under constant inlet conditions. We provide evidence of multistability and unsteady dynamics and find good agreement with a theoretical {one-dimensional advection} model for blood flow in microvascular networks{ that relies on the widely used laws for rheology and phase separation}. We discuss the ramifications for microfluidic experiments and measurements using blood and implications for in vivo microcirculation. Our findings suggest that further modeling in microvascular networks should discard the usual assumption of unique, steady-state flow solutions, with crucial consequences regarding gas, nutrient, and waste transport.</description>

      <title>Activity-induced phase transition and coarsening dynamics in dry apolar active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic \new{off-lattice} dynamics. \new{The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and occurs alongside a fluctuation-dominated phase separation.} Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics where nematic ordering precedes particle clustering. Both the nematic and density fields exhibit similar scaling behaviors, exhibiting dynamic exponents $z_S \approx 2.5$ and $z_\rho \approx 2.34$, consistently falling within the range of 2 and 3.</description>
