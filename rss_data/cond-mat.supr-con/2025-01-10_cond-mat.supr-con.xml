      <title>Non-Hermiticity enhanced topological immunity of one-dimensional $p$-wave superconducting chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the immunity of topological superconductors against non-local disorder is one of the key issues in both fundamental researches and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity can enhance the robustness of topological edge states against non-local disorder. To illustrate that, we consider a one-dimensional (1D) generalized Kitaev model with the asymmetric hopping in the presence of disorder. It is shown that the region supporting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) against non-local disorder will be enlarged by the non-Hermiticity. Through both the numerical and analytical analyses, we show that non-Hermiticity can stabilize the topological superconducting (SC) phase against higher disorder strength. Our studies would offer new insights into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology.</description>

      <title>Tree Models Machine Learning to Identify Liquid Metal based Alloy Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors, which are crucial for modern advanced technologies due to their zero-resistance properties, are limited by low Tc and the difficulty of accurate prediction. This article made the initial endeavor to apply machine learning to predict the critical temperature (Tc) of liquid metal (LM) alloy superconductors. Leveraging the SuperCon dataset, which includes extensive superconductor property data, we developed a machine learning model to predict Tc. After addressing data issues through preprocessing, we compared multiple models and found that the Extra Trees model outperformed others with an R2 of 0.9519 and an RMSE of 6.2624 K. This model is subsequently used to predict Tc for LM alloys, revealing In0.5Sn0.5 as having the highest Tc at 7.01 K. Furthermore, we extended the prediction to 2,145 alloys binary and 45,670 ternary alloys across 66 metal elements and promising results were achieved. This work demonstrates the advantages of tree-based models in predicting Tc and would help accelerate the discovery of high-performance LM alloy superconductors in the coming time.</description>

      <title>Competition of superconducting pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Various theoretical approaches have been applied to the study of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, but lead to a number of contradicting results. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and at the same time particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as changes of the electronic structure through pressure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. Our work paves the way to understanding seemingly contradictory theoretical results within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Double Majorana Vortex Flat Bands in the Topological Dirac Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex lines, known as topological defects, are cable of trapping Majorana modes in superconducting topological materials. Previous studies have primarily focused on topological bands with conventional s-wave pairing. However, topological Dirac semimetals exhibiting a unique orbital texture can favor unconventional pairing when electronic correlations are significant. The topology of vortices in these systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we investigate the vortex bound states in superconducting Dirac semimetals, with a particular focus on the orbital-singlet unconventional pairing, which generates higher-order Majorana hinge modes. Remarkably, we identify robust double Majorana vortex flat bands at zero energy. In type-I Dirac semimetals, these Majorana flat bands are located between the projections of two superconduting Dirac points. In contrast, in type-II Dirac semimetals, they extend across the entire 1D Brillouin zone. These double flat bands arise from a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology defined by an effective particle-hole symmetry and are protected by the four-fold rotational symmetry. Additionally, we observe that moving the vortex line close to a hinge can trivialize the higher-order Majorana arc on the hinge, leaving a single Majorana mode at the vortex core due to the hybridization of Majorana modes. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental implications for correlated Dirac semimetals, such as electron-doped iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and topological superconductivity in an unconventional superconducting platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a $d-$wave altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs). On the other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge that modes coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing total magnetization.</description>

      <title>Nondipole interaction between two uniformly magnetized spheres and its relation to superconducting levitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytically solving the magnetostatic Maxwell equations in the bispherical coordinates, we calculate the magnetic field around two uniformly magnetized spheres oriented so that their magnetic moments are parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the spheres. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is often claimed in the literature, the magnetic interaction between such spheres is not equivalent to the interaction between two point magnetic dipoles placed in the centers of the spheres. The nonzero levitation force acting on a uniformly magnetized sphere or a point magnetic dipole above a superconducting sphere in the ideal Meissner state is a clear manifestation of the non-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz transition and triplet $p$-wave pairing from the induced ferromagnetic plaquette via spin differentiated nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional extended Hubbard model on a square lattice and incorporate spin-differentiated nearest neighbor (NN) interactions where the equal-spin ($V_{uu}$) and unequal-spin ($V_{ud}$) terms are independently tuned parameters. We compute single-particle excitations as well as static spin and pairing susceptibilities perturbatively up to the fourth order within the thermodynamic limit and at a finite fixed temperature. By explicitly encoding a ferromagnetic-like NN interaction ($V_{uu} &lt; V_{ud}$), we induce a competition among the uniform $q = (0,0)$, collinear $q = (\pi,0)$, and staggered $q = (\pi,\pi)$ spin excitations. This results in the formation of short-ranged $2\times 2$ ferromagnetic plaquettes arranged in staggered or striped patterns. Kinetic frustration in hopping, both within and between these plaquettes, manifests in single-particle properties, resulting in a reduction of bandwidth and ultimately triggering a Lifshitz transition to quasi-one-dimensional bands. Furthermore, an attractive effective interaction within the localized ferromagnetic plaquette results in the emergence of equal-spin triplet $p$-wave pairing. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong magnetic fluctuations, even at finite length scales, can significantly influence single-particle and pairing properties without breaking translational symmetry. Our approach provides a novel pathway to realize a variety of rich magnetic phases and Fermi surface reconstruction driven by interactions in the absence of explicit geometric frustration.</description>

      <title>Spin caloritronics as a probe of nonunitary superconductors</title>

Abstract: Superconducting spintronics explores the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, sparking significant interest in nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting phenomena. However, identifying nonunitary superconductors remains challenging. We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin-chirality of the condensate induces the spin-Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors. These spin caloritronics phenomena offer a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires for pulsed magnets investigated by ultrasonic techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.</description>

      <title>Circuit Quantisation from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</description>
