      <title>Energetic ($&lt; 2$ MeV) Ion Environment of the Magnetosphere as measured by ASPEX-STEPS on board Aditya-L1 during its earth-bound phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During its earth-bound phase of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft of India, the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) was operated whenever the orbit was above 52000 km during 11-19 September 2023. This phase of operation provided measurements of energetic ions (with energies 0.1-2 MeV) in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and interplanetary medium. Three interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) hit the magnetosphere during this period. This provided opportunity to examine the relative roles of external (ICME) and internal (substorm) drivers in controlling the energetic ion environment in the terrestrial magnetosphere by detailed spectral analysis of energetic ion fluxes measured by two units of ASPEX-STEPS. We identify three distinctly different conditions of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF $B_z = 0$, $&gt; 0$, and $&lt; 0$) and use the derived spectral indices to understand the role of external and internal drivers. By combining these with the simultaneous eneregtic ion flux variations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) around the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the Earth's magnetosphere, we show that the polarity of IMF $B_z$ influences the energetic ion spectra in the magnetosphere by modulating the interplay of the external and internal drivers. Further, we observe directional anisotropy of energetic ions and much harder spectra associated with one ICME compared to another one, although both led to geomagnetic storms having nearly equal intensities.</description>
