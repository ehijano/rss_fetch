      <title>Homeomorphic Sobolev extensions of parametrizations of Jordan curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each homeomorphic parametrization of a Jordan curve via the unit circle extends to a homeomorphism of the entire plane. It is a natural question to ask if such a homeomorphism can be chosen so as to have some Sobolev regularity. This prompts the simplified question: for a homeomorphic embedding of the unit circle into the plane, when can we find a homeomorphism from the unit disk that has the same boundary values and integrable first-order distributional derivatives?
  We give the optimal geometric criterion for the interior Jordan domain so that there exists a Sobolev homeomorphic extension for any homeomorphic parametrization of the Jordan curve. The problem is partially motivated by trying to understand which boundary values can correspond to deformations of finite energy.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclic subspaces for sequences of finite order differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that, if $(P_n)$ is a sequence of polynomials with complex coefficients having unbounded valences and tending to infinity at sufficiently many points, then there is an infinite dimensional closed subspace of entire functions, as well a dense $\mathfrak{c}$-dimensional subspace of entire functions, all of whose nonzero members are hypercyclic for the corresponding sequence $(P_n(D))$ of differential operators. In both cases, the subspace can be chosen so as to contain any prescribed hypercylic function.</description>

      <title>A general dynamical theory of Schwarz reflections, B-involutions, and algebraic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study matings of (anti-)polynomials and Fuchsian, reflection groups as Schwarz reflections, B-involutions or as (anti-)holomorphic correspondences, as well as their parameter spaces. We prove the existence of matings of generic (anti-)polynomials, such as periodically repelling, or geometrically finite (anti-)polynomials, with circle maps arising from the corresponding groups. These matings emerge naturally as degenerate (anti-)polynomial-like maps, and we show that the corresponding parameter space slices for such matings bear strong resemblance with parameter spaces of polynomial maps. Furthermore, we provide algebraic descriptions for these matings, and construct algebraic correspondences that combine generic (anti-)polynomials and genus zero orbifolds in a common dynamical plane, providing a new concrete evidence to Fatou's vision of a unified theory of groups and maps.</description>

      <title>Defining equations of $7$-dimensional model CR hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a complete normal form for models of real analytic uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, and present a detailed study of their local invariants. The normal form illustrates that $2$-nondegenerate models in $\mathbb{C}^4$ comprise a moduli space parameterized by two univariate holomorphic functions, which is in sharp contrast to the well known Levi-nondegenerate setting and the more recently discovered behavior of $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^3$. In further contrast to these previously studied settings, we demonstrate that not all $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^4$ arise as perturbations of homogeneous models. We derive defining equations for the homogeneous models, a set of $9$ structures, and find explicit formulas for their infinitesimal symmetries.</description>

      <title>On the integral means spectrum of univalent functions with quasconformal extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we show that the integral means spectrum of any univalent function admitting a quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane is strictly less than the universal integral means spectrum. This gives an affirmative answer to a question raised in our recent paper.</description>

      <title>Operators commuting with complex symmetric weighted composition operators on $H^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initially study when an anti-linear Toeplitz operator is in the commutant of a composition operator. Primarily, we investigate weighted composition operators $W_{g,\psi}$ commuting with complex symmetric weighted composition operators $W_{f,\varphi}$ on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$. In particular, we give the descriptions of the symbols $g$ and $\psi$ such that the inducing weighted composition operator $W_{g,\psi}$ commutes with the complex symmetric weighted composition operator $W_{f,\varphi}$ with the conjugation $\mathcal{J}$. Furthermore, we subsequently demonstrate that these weighted composition operators are normal and complex symmetric in accordance with the properties of the fixed point of the associated symbol $\varphi$.</description>

      <title>Calculation of $6j$-symbols for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An explicit description of the multiplicity space that describes occurrences of irreducible representations in a splitting of a tensor product of two irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is given. Using this description an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is derived. The $6j$-symbol is expressed through a value of a generalized hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on continuous univariate probability distributions, like McKay distributions, $K$-distribution, generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and generalised McKay distributions, with support $[0,\infty),$ which are related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and in most cases we show that they belong to the class infinitely divisible distributions, self-decomposable distributions, generalized gamma convolutions and hyperbolically completely monotone densities. Some of the results are known, however the proofs are new and we use special functions technique. Integral representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions as well as of quotients of Gaussian hypergeometric functions, or modified Bessel functions of the second kind play an important role in our study. In addition, by using a different approach we rediscover a Stieltjes transform representation due to Hermann Hankel for the product of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and we also deduce a series of new Stieltjes transform representations for products, quotients and their reciprocals concerning modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. By using these results we obtain new infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions with Laplace transforms related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind. Moreover, we show that the new Stieltjes transform representations have some interesting applications and we list some open problems which may be of interest for further research. In addition, we present a new proof via the Pick function characterization theorem for the infinite divisibility of the ratio of two gamma random variables and we present some new Stieltjes transform representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions.</description>
