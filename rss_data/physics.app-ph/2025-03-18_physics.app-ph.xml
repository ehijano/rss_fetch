      <title>Direct experimental observation of total absorption and loss compensation using sound waves with complex frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally investigate the application of a transient signal with complex frequencies to the absorption and transmission of sound waves. Indeed, the emission of a wave with an exponentially varying amplitude in time is analogous, in the frequency domain, to a monochromatic wave with spatial gain or loss. Our results show that by exciting a non-critically coupled Helmholtz resonator with a wave having a growing amplitude, total absorption can still be achieved. Furthermore, the lossy propagation of a traveling wave in a duct is also studied, and it is shown that the losses embedded in the complex wavenumber can be compensated by using a transient signal with decreasing amplitude. These results confirm the potential of complex frequency excitation for exploring new means of manipulating sound waves to mimic gain and loss.</description>

      <title>High Magnetic Sensitivity at the Coercive Field Induced by Shear Horizontal SAW in Polycrystalline FeGa Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Love wave device was designed to generate surface acoustic waves (SAWs) with strong shear-horizontal polarization, interacting with a polycrystalline Fe72Ga28 magnetostrictive layer. The shear strain induced by these waves at a frequency of approximately 160 MHz, coupled with magnetoelastic effects, leads to domain magnetization oscillation, resulting in unique responses that are particularly pronounced near the coercive field. Experimental results reveal that the response of the sensor is highly sensitive to the angle between the applied magnetic field and the wave propagation direction, with profiles that can vary significantly depending on this angle, with some configurations resulting in practically opposite responses. A particularly relevant case arises when the magnetic field is aligned with the Love wave propagation direction. In this case, the sensor response shows mainly a monotonic increase with the magnetic field, except near the coercive field, where a sharp peak emerges and then abruptly collapses, resulting in a magnetic sensitivity of 4.92 Hz/nT. This high sensitivity near the coercive field opens the door to the development of high-performance sensors, simplifying electronics while leveraging the key advantages of SAW technology, including low power consumption, compact size, real-time response, and portability. A theoretical model is also discussed to further understand the underlying phenomena and optimize the design of next-generation devices, which hold significant potential for sensor applications across various fields.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved radiative recombination in black silicon</title>

Abstract: Black silicon (b-Si) has been receiving a great deal of interest for its potential to be used in applications ranging from sensors to solar cells and electrodes in batteries due to its promising optical, electronic and structural properties. Several approaches have been used to demonstrate the possibility of producing application quality b-Si, which also exhibits light emission properties. The photoluminescence is a useful technique to identify recombination pathways and thus enable us to optimize device quality. In this work, we report the results of the radiative recombination dynamics in b-Si produced by a technique involving thermal oxidation, photoresist coating and chlorine plasma etching. An ultrafast blue luminescence component competing with non-radiative recombination at surface defects was identified as no-phonon radiative recombination. This component involves two decay processes with a peak energy at around 480 nm, which have the fast component of about 15 ps followed by a component of around 50 ps lifetime. The emission exhibits a slow process in red spectral region with time constant of 1500 ps. When the surface is smoothed, the lifetime of carriers increased up to 4500 ps and the emission peak blue shifted indicating downsizing in dimensions. The results are correlated with transmission electron microscopy, localized vibrational modes and spectroscopic ellipsometry and interpreted through the presence of quantum</description>

      <title>Investigation of physical and electrical properties of a suboxide layer at Si/Si-hexafluoride interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon suboxide SiOx (x&lt;2.0) offers promising industrial application possibilities ranging from electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, which are used widely in electrical vehicles and portable devices to sensing applications. Therefore, a low cost, environmental friendly and high performance silicon oxide materials are required for an appropriate operation of any electronic gadget. In this work, we report on the physical and electrical properties of a suboxide layer of up to 1 {\mu}m, which was grown on silicon during the formation of a dielectric layer, namely the ammonium silicon hexafluoride. It is a stable oxide exhibiting light emission from 400 nm to 1700 nm offering scalable and cost-effective large area processing capability. The measurement results reveal interesting properties, which are required to be understood clearly before proceeding with any suitable application. The results have been analyzed using state-of-the-art physical and electrical characterization techniques such as ellipsometry, AFM, SEM, FTIR, photoluminescence lifetime and resistive switching measurements to determine structural, optical and electrical properties. At 300 K the carrier lifetime measurements reveal the lifetime values ranging from about few tens of picosecond up to 4500 picoseconds. Scanning probe analysis indicate a surface roughness of about 30 Angstr\"om. Resistive memory forming was observed also in these layers at relatively low power thresholds. We provide a comprehensive description of the physical and electrical properties in order to clarify the origin of the observed features. The wavelength dependent real {\epsilon}_1 ({\omega}) and the imaginary {\epsilon}_2 ({\omega}) dielectric functions provided useful insights on optical properties. A lookout is given for the possible applications of this special SiOx dielectric oxide layer.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature mid-infrared detection using metasurface-absorber-integrated phononic crystal oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (MIR) detectors find extensive applications in chemical sensing, spectroscopy, communications, biomedical diagnosis and space explorations. Alternative to semiconductor MIR photodiodes and bolometers, mechanical-resonator-based MIR detectors show advantages in higher sensitivity and lower noise at room temperature, especially towards longer wavelength infrared. Here, we demonstrate uncooled room-temperature MIR detectors based on lithium niobate surface acoustic wave phononic crystal (PnC) resonators integrated with wavelength-and-polarization-selective metasurface absorber arrays. The detection is based on the resonant frequency shift induced by the local temperature change due to MIR absorptions. The PnC resonator is configured in an oscillating mode, enabling active readout and low frequency noise. Compared with detectors based on tethered thin-film mechanical resonators, our non-suspended, fully supported PnC resonators offer lower noise, faster thermal response, and robustness in both fabrication and practical applications. Our oscillator-based MIR detector shows a relative frequency noise of $5.47 \times 10^{-12}$ $\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at its oscillation frequency of 1 GHz, leading to an incident noise equivalent power of 40 $\mathrm{pW/{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}}$ for a MIR at 6 ${\mu}$m wavelength, a response time constant of 169 $\mu$s, and a large dynamic range of $10^8$ in incident MIR power. Our device architecture is compatible with the scalable manufacturing process and can be readily extended to a broader spectral range by tailoring the absorbing wavelengths of metasurface absorbers.</description>

      <title>Identification of Two Distinct Antiferromagnetic Phases in the Au-Al-Gd Quasicrystal Approximant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural and physical properties of two single-grain Au-Al-Gd 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) with analyzed compositions Au73.67Al12.24Gd14.09 and Au74.67Al11.35Gd13.98 were thoroughly investigated. The two variants are iso-structural (cubic, space group: Im-3 undergoing sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at TN = 9.6 K and TN = 8.3 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements in both samples evidenced sharp jump at TN, associated with the AFM transition, accompanied by broad Schottky-type anomalies at lower temperatures. Strikingly, the two 1/1 ACs exhibited markedly different responses to applied magnetic fields: one displayed a pronounced metamagnetic anomaly while the other did not. In this regard, variational calculations with adiabatic transformation of the magnetic field in realistic structural models identified the existence of two possible AFM phases: the cuboc phase with a metamagnetic anomaly and the cluster N\'eel phase without it, thereby clearly revealing the possible magnetic structures of the present AFM variants. These findings have led to the establishment of a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram for Heisenberg-type 1/1 ACs. This work not only advances our understanding of magnetic phase transitions in these complex systems but also suggests the existence of a broader spectrum of unexplored magnetic states in Tsai-type materials.</description>

      <title>Enabling Highly Efficient Infrared Silicon Photodetectors via Disordered Metasurfaces with Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photodetectors are highly desirable for their CMOS compatibility, low cost, and fast response speed. However, their application the infrared (IR) is limited by silicon's intrinsic bandgap, which restricts its detection to photons with wavelengths shorter than 1100 nm. Although several methods have been developed to extend silicon photodetectors further in the IR range, these approaches often introduce additional challenges, such as increased fabrication complexity and compatibility issues with standard CMOS processes. Here, we present an approach to overcome these limitations by integrating disordered metasurfaces with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), enabling IR detection by silicon photodetectors. The disordered design consists of hybrid Mie-plasmonic cavities, which can enhance both the near-field localization and wide-band light absorption from visible to IR, improving photocurrent conversion. Compared to ordered structures, the infrared absorption and near field of the highly disordered configuration are increased by 2.6-folds and 3.9-folds, respectively. UCNPs not only convert near-infrared photons into visible light but also enhance absorption in the mid-infrared range, thereby improving hot electron generation. The measured responsivity of the disordered element for 1550 nm laser is up to 0.22 A/W at room temperature, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 17.6%. Our design not only enhances the photocurrent performance significantly, but also extends the working wavelength of silicon photodetectors to IR wavelength, making them suitable for broad spectrum applications.</description>

Abstract: We propose an alternative way to determine GaAs carrier lifetime using pump-probe measurement based on fibre optics and integrated waveguides. We find that our GaAs samples have the lifetime ranging from 30-80 ps, supporting the bandwidth $\geq$ 12.5 GHz. The platform utilised in this work could offer a cost-effective way to investigate photocarrier lifetime. Moreover, it may have the potential for high-speed switches and detectors, or could be exploited for possible all-optical modulation.</description>

      <title>Probing intensity noise in ultrafast pulses using the dispersive Fourier transform augmented by quantum sensitivity analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reach the next frontier in multimode nonlinear optics, it is crucial to better understand the classical and quantum phenomena of systems with many interacting degrees of freedom -- both how they emerge and how they can be tailored to emerging applications, from multimode quantum light generation to optical computing. Soliton fission and Raman scattering comprise two such phenomena that are ideal testbeds for exploring multimode nonlinear optics, especially power-dependent physics. To fully capture the complexity of such processes, an experimental measurement technique capable of measuring shot-to-shot pulse variations is necessary. The dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) is the ideal technique to achieve this goal, using chromatic dispersion to temporally stretch an ultrafast pulse and map its spectrum onto a measurable temporal waveform. Here, we apply DFT to explore the power-dependent mean field and noise properties of soliton fission and Raman scattering. To explain quantum noise properties, the traditional approach is to perform several hundred stochastic simulations for computing statistics. In our work, we apply quantum sensitivity analysis (QSA) to compute the noise in any output observable based on fluctuations in the input pulse, all using a single backwards differentiation step. We find that the combination of DFT and QSA provides a powerful framework for understanding the quantum and classical properties of soliton fission and Raman scattering, and can be generalized to other multimode nonlinear phenomena.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Nano-Imaging of Excitons in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Indium selenides for next-generation low-power computing devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (&gt;2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Are There High-Density Deep States in AtomicLayer-Deposited IGZO Thin Film?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been well recognized that there exist high-density deep states in IGZO thin films. Many of the device characteristics of IGZO transistors, such as negative bias illumination stability (NBIS),were understood to be related to these deep states. However, in this work, it is found that deep state density (NtD) of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) IGZO transistors can be an ultra-low value (2.3*10^12 /cm^3) by the proposed NBIS-free light assisted I-V measurements so that the deep states do not affect the I-V characteristics even in subthreshold region. This work also reveals that NBIS is not related to the photoexcitation of electrons in deep states. Our results suggest that the existence of deep states and the impact of deep states on ALD IGZO transistors may need to be revisited.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Stability of Geopolymer Activator Solutions for Optimised Synthesis through Thermodynamic Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Statistical RF Fields at High Magnetic Field with a Quantum Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in fields ranging from chemistry, material science to neuroscience. Nanoscale NMR spectroscopy using Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a promising platform due to an unprecedented sensitivity down to the single spin level. At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin fluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization. However, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques could not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to long measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent averaging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification. We demonstrate these protocols on an artificial radiofrequency signal detected with a single NV center at 2.7 T. Through this, the signal-to-noise scaling with number of measurements $N$ is improved from $N^{0.5}$ to $N^1$, improving the measurement time significantly. The relevance of rectification for the detection of statistical polarization using NV ensembles is outlined, paving the way for efficient nanoscale NMR spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanisms of flexoelectricity in oxide membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern electromechanical actuators and sensors rely on the piezoelectric effect that linearly couples strain and electric polarization. However, this effect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast, the flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and is a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry. Flexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of strain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the strain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using multislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable picometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions, correcting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This enables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the flexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements, first-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk contribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be switched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft phonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large response and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence might explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the values of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium titanate. As the strain state of curved membranes can be tuned, our approach also suggests an approach to engineer nanoscale flexoelectric polarization using strain as a control parameter.</description>

      <title>Emergent B2 chemical orderings in the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys studied via first-principles theory and atomistic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</description>

      <title>Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams could be a potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to their properties such as ultralightweight, huge volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that the charge-storage of carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by the wettability, surface area, and porosity of carbon nanostructures. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced around fifty times and the widened voltage of the device increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, although observed in previous literatures but unexplained, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser-deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</description>

      <title>Artificial Spacetimes for Reactive Control of Resource-Limited Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-based reactive control provides a minimalist, decentralized route to guiding robots that lack onboard computation. Such schemes are well suited to resource-limited machines like microrobots, yet implementation artifacts, limited behaviors, and the frequent lack of formal guarantees blunt adoption. Here, we address these challenges with a new geometric approach called artificial spacetimes. We show that reactive robots navigating control fields obey the same dynamics as light rays in general relativity. This surprising connection allows us to adopt techniques from relativity and optics for constructing and analyzing control fields. When implemented, artificial spacetimes guide robots around structured environments, simultaneously avoiding boundaries and executing tasks like rallying or sorting, even when the field itself is static. We augment these capabilities with formal tools for analyzing what robots will do and provide experimental validation with silicon-based microrobots. Combined, this work provides a new framework for generating composed robot behaviors with minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>Low-density functionalized amorphous carbon nanofoam as binder-free Supercapacitor electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoporous carbon materials containing small domains of sp2-carbon with highly disordered structures are promising for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we synthesize amorphous carbon nanofoam with 98% volumetric void fraction and low mass density of around 30 mg/cm3 by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. With the unavoidable oxygen functional groups on the nanoporous surface, carbon nanofoam and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofoams are directly grown on the desired substrate under different background gases (Ar, N2, N2-H2), and employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Among the background gases used in synthesis, the use of nitrogen yields nanofoam with higher thickness and more N-content with higher graphitic-N. From the test of amorphous carbon nanofoam supercapacitor device, nitrogenated amorphous carbon electrode shows a higher areal capacitance of 4.1 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s in aqueous electrolyte, a better capacitance retention at higher current, and excellent cycle stability (98%) over 10000 charge-discharge cycles are achieved compared to not-functionalized counterpart prepared under Ar background gas (2.7 mF/cm2 and cycle stability of 88%).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing momentum in lunar exploration programs and urgent need for robust communication systems capable of operating in dust-laden lunar environments necessitate comprehensive understanding of channel propagation characteristics in lunar conditions. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of terahertz (THz) channel propagation characteristics through lunar dust environments, critical for establishing reliable communication and sensing infrastructure on the Moon. We develop an extended Mie scattering model incorporating the unique properties of lunar dust particles (Apollo 11 sample 10084, Apollo 14 sample 14003, and Apollo 17 sample 70051), including their irregular morphology, dielectric characteristics, and charge-dependent behavior. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, we examine both power and bit error rate (BER) performance across varying dust conditions. Our results reveal distinct relationships between particle charge levels, morphological characteristics, and channel performance with power loss patterns and BER evolution. Our findings provide essential guidelines for developing robust lunar communication systems that integrate sensing capabilities, contributing to the establishment of sustainable lunar infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to actively control wakes and noise from flow past a cylinder by leveraging acoustic-based pressure feedback. A hydrophone array captures downstream signals, enabling a DRL agent to adjust jet actuators on the cylinder's surface in real-time. The method reduces noise levels by up to 9.5\% and drag coefficients by up to 23.8\%, effectively minimizing flow-induced vibrations. This highlights the potential of DRL-driven active flow control for engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Crowding Effects during DNA Translocation in Nanopipettes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Inverse Design of Electromagnetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each inverse design iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to milliseconds per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. The complete method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional electromagnetics solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 16,000x, lowering the design process from multiple days to weeks down to minutes. The approach stands to transform inverse design in electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>
