      <title>De Bruijn Sequences with Minimum Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy of a binary string is the maximum (absolute) difference between the number of ones and the number of zeroes over all possible substrings of the given binary string. In this note we determine the minimal discrepancy that a binary de Bruijn sequence of order $n$ can achieve, which is $n$. This was an open problem until now. We give an algorithm that constructs a binary de Bruijn sequence with minimal discrepancy. A slight modification of this algorithm deals with arbitrary alphabets and yields de Bruijn sequences of order $n$ with discrepancy at most $1$ above the trivial lower bound $n$.</description>

      <title>Number of Subgraphs and Their Converses in Tournaments and New Digraph Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An oriented graph $D$ is converse invariant if, for any tournament $T$, the number of copies of $D$ in $T$ is equal to that of its converse $-D$. El Sahili and Ghazo Hanna [J. Graph Theory 102 (2023), 684-701] showed that any oriented graph $D$ with maximum degree at most 2 is converse invariant. They proposed a question: Can we characterize all converse invariant oriented graphs?
  In this paper, we introduce a digraph polynomial and employ it to give a necessary condition for an oriented graph to be converse invariant. This polynomial serves as a cornerstone in proving all the results presented in this paper. In particular, we characterize all orientations of trees with diameter at most 3 that are converse invariant. We also show that all orientations of regular graphs are not converse invariant if $D$ and $-D$ have different degree sequences. In addition, in contrast to the findings of El Sahili and Ghazo Hanna, we prove that every connected graph $G$ with maximum degree at least $3$, admits an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $D$ is not converse invariant. We pose one conjecture.</description>

      <title>Fractional coloring with local demands and applications to degree-sequence bounds on the independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.11806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a fractional coloring, vertices of a graph are assigned measurable subsets of the real line and adjacent vertices receive disjoint subsets; the fractional chromatic number of a graph is at most $k$ if it has a fractional coloring in which each vertex receives a subset of $[0, 1]$ of measure at least $1/k$. We introduce and develop the theory of "fractional colorings with local demands" wherein each vertex "demands" a certain amount of color that is determined by local parameters such as its degree or the clique number of its neighborhood. This framework provides the natural setting in which to generalize degree-sequence type bounds on the independence number. Indeed, by Linear Programming Duality, all of the problems we study have an equivalent formulation as a problem concerning weighted independence numbers, and they often imply new bounds on the independence number.
  Our results and conjectures are inspired by many of the most classical results and important open problems concerning the independence number and the chromatic number, often simultaneously. We conjecture a local strengthening of both Shearer's bound on the independence number of triangle-free graphs and the fractional relaxation of Molloy's recent bound on their chromatic number, as well as a longstanding problem of Ajtai et al.\ on the independence number of $K_r$-free graphs and the fractional relaxations of Reed's $\omega, \Delta, \chi$ Conjecture and the Total Coloring Conjecture. We prove an approximate version of the first two, and we prove "local demands" versions of Vizing's Theorem and of some $\chi$-boundedness results.</description>

      <title>Refined Bitcoin Security-Latency Under Network Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study security-latency bounds for Nakamoto consensus, i.e., how secure a block is after it becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We improve the state-of-the-art bounds by analyzing the race between adversarial and honest chains in three different phases. We find the probability distribution of the growth of the adversarial chains under models similar to those in [Guo, Ren; AFT 2022] when a target block becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results. Combining all three phases provides novel upper and lower bounds for blockchains with small $\lambda\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Zero-One Laws for Random Feasibility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general random model of a combinatorial optimization problem with geometric structure that encapsulates both linear programming and integer linear programming. Let $Q$ be a bounded set called the feasible set, $E$ be an arbitrary set called the constraint set, and $A$ be a random linear transform. We define and study the $\ell^q$-margin, $M_q := d_q(AQ, E)$. The margin quantifies the feasibility of finding $y \in AQ$ satisfying the constraint $y \in E$. Our contribution is to establish strong concentration of the margin for any $q \in (2,\infty]$, assuming only that $E$ has permutation symmetry. The case of $q = \infty$ is of particular interest in applications -- specifically to combinatorial ``balancing'' problems -- and is markedly out of the reach of the classical isoperimetric and concentration-of-measure tools that suffice for $q \le 2$.
  Generality is a key feature of this result: we assume permutation symmetry of the constraint set and nothing else. This allows us to encode many optimization problems in terms of the margin, including random versions of: the closest vector problem, integer linear feasibility, perceptron-type problems, $\ell^q$-combinatorial discrepancy for $2 \le q \le \infty$, and matrix balancing. Concentration of the margin implies a host of new sharp threshold results in these models, and also greatly simplifies and extends some key known results.</description>
