      <title>Schr\"odinger operators with concentric $\delta$--shell interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb R^3$ with finitely many concentric spherical $\delta$--shell interactions. The operators are defined by the quadratic form method and are described by continuity across each shell together with the usual jump condition for the radial derivative. Using a boundary integral approach based on the free Green kernel and single--layer potentials, we derive an explicit resolvent representation for an arbitrary number of shells with bounded coupling strengths. This yields a concrete Kre\u{\i}n--type formula and a boundary operator whose noninvertibility characterizes the discrete spectrum, and it is compatible with a partial--wave reduction under rotational symmetry.
  We then specialize to the two--shell case with constant couplings and obtain a detailed description of the negative spectrum. In particular, we show that the ground state (when it exists) lies in the $s$--wave sector and derive an explicit secular equation for bound states. For large shell separation, each bound level approaches the corresponding single--shell level with exponentially small corrections, while a genuine tunneling splitting appears when the single--shell levels are tuned to coincide. As a simple calibration, we relate the two--shell parameters to representative core--shell quantum dot scales. At the level of order--of--magnitude and qualitative trends, Type~I configurations yield a relatively strongly confined state, whereas Type~II configurations produce a comparatively shallow outer--shell state.</description>

      <title>The Unruh state for bosonic Teukolsky fields on subextreme Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the quantization of Teukolsky scalars of spin $0$, $\pm 1$, and $\pm 2$ within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. We first discuss the classical phase space, from which we subsequently construct the algebra. This sheds light on which fields are conjugates of each other. Further, we construct the Unruh state for this theory on Kerr and show that it is Hadamard on the black hole exterior and the interior up to the inner horizon. This shows not only that Hadamard states exist for this theory, but also extends the existence and Hadamard property of the Unruh state to (bosonic) Teukolsky fields on Kerr, where such a result was previously missing.</description>

      <title>Time-marching representation based quantum algorithms for the Lattice Boltzmann model of the advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel framework for developing quantum algorithms for the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) applied to the advection-diffusion equation. We formulate the collision-streaming evolution of the LBM as a compact time-marching scheme and rigorously establish its stability under low Mach number conditions. This unified formulation eliminates the need for classical measurement at each time step, enabling a systematic and fully quantum implementation. Building upon this representation, we investigate two distinct quantum algorithmic approaches. The first is a time-marching quantum algorithm realized through sequential evolution operators, for which we provide a detailed implementation-including block-encoding and dilating unitarization-along with a full complexity analysis. The second employs a quantum linear systems algorithm, which encodes the entire time evolution into a single global linear system. We demonstrate that both methods achieve comparable asymptotic time complexities. The proposed algorithms are validated through numerical simulations of benchmark problems in one and two dimensions. This work provides a systematic, measurement-free pathway for the quantum simulation of advection-diffusion processes via the lattice Boltzmann paradigm.</description>

      <title>The Yang--Mills measure on compact surfaces as a universal scaling limit of lattice gauge models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the 2 dimensional Yang-Mills measure on compact surfaces from a unified continuum and discrete perspective. We construct the Yang-Mills measure as a random distributional 1-form on surfaces of arbitrary genus equipped with an arbitrary smooth area form, using geometric tools based on zero-area bands and cylindrical resolutions. This yields a canonical bulk-singular decomposition of the measure, reflecting the topology of the surface.
  We prove a universality theorem stating that the continuum Yang-Mills measure arises as the scaling limit of a wide class of lattice gauge theories, including Wilson, Manton, and Villain actions, on any compact surface. We study the convergence in natural spaces of distributions with anisotropic regularity. As further consequences, we obtain a new intrinsic construction of the Yang-Mills measure, independent of the previous constructions in the literature, and prove the convergence of correlation functions and Segal amplitudes on all compact surfaces.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric Dirac-Yang-Mills pairs on Riemannian 3-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct examples of spherically symmetric Dirac-Yang-Mills pairs on Riemannian 3-manifolds with the structure group SU(2). This approach yields coupled solutions (i.e. the connection is not a Yang-Mills connection) and among them are solutions on S^1(r_1) x S^2(r_2) for certain radii r_1 and r_2. These are, to the authors' best knowledge, the first examples of coupled Dirac-Yang-Mills pairs on a closed Riemannian spin manifold.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint extensions of symmetric relations associated with systems of ordinary differential equations with distributional coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extension theory for the two-dimensional first-order system $Ju' +qu = wf$ of differential equations on the real interval $(a,b)$ where $J$ is a constant, invertible, skew-hermitian matrix and $q$ and $w$ are matrices whose entries are real distributions of order $0$ with $q$ hermitian and $w$ non-negative. Specifically, we characterize the boundary conditions for solutions $u$ in the closure of the minimal relation, as well as describe the properties of quasi-boundary conditions which yield self-adjoint extensions. We then apply these ideas to a popular extension of non-negative minimal relations: the Krein-von Neumann extension. For more context on how the Krein-von Neumann is defined, an appendix shows a construction of the Friedrichs extension from which the Krein-von Neumann is traditionally defined.</description>

      <title>Four-point functions with fractional R-symmetry excitations in the D1-D5 CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study correlation functions with fractional-mode excitations of the R-symmetry currents in D1-D5 CFT. We show how fractional-mode excitations lift to the covering surface associated with correlation functions as a specific sum of integer-mode excitations, with coefficients that can be determined exactly from the covering map in terms of Bell polynomials. We consider the four-point functions of fractional excitations of two chiral/anti-chiral NS fields, Ramond ground states and the twist-two scalar modulus deformation operator that drives the CFT away from the free point. We derive explicit formulas for classes of these functions with twist structures $(n)$-$(2)$-$(2)$-$(n)$ and $(n_1)(n_2)$-$(2)$-$(2)$-$(n_1)(n_2)$, the latter involving double-cycle fields. The final answer for the four-point functions always depends only on the lift of the base-space cross-ratio. We discuss how this relates to Hurwitz blocks associated with different conjugacy classes of permutations, the corresponding OPE channels and fusion rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a difference Lax form to construct simultaneous integrals of motion of the fourth Painlev\'e equation and the difference second Painlev\'e equation over fields with finite characteristic $p&gt;0$. For $p\neq 3$, we show that the integrals can be normalised to be completely invariant under the corresponding extended affine Weyl group action. We show that components of reducible fibres of integrals correspond to reductions to Riccatti equations. We further describe a method to construct non-rational algebraic solutions in a given positive characteristic. We also discuss a projective reduction of the integrals.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-Phase Separation toward Optimal and Fast-Forwardable Simulation of Non-Unitary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of the linear non-unitary dynamics is crucial in scientific computing. In this work, we establish a generic framework, referred to as the Amplitude-Phase Separation (APS) methods, which formulates any non-unitary evolution into separate simulation of a unitary operator and a Hermitian operator, thus allow one to take best advantage of, and to even improve existing algorithms, developed for unitary or Hermitian evolution respectively. We utilize two techniques: the first achieves a provably optimal query complexity via a shifted Dyson series; the second breaks the conventional linear dependency, achieving fast-forwarding by exhibiting a square-root dependence on the norm of the dissipative part. Furthermore, one can derive existing methods such as the LCHS (Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation) and the NDME (Non-Diagonal Density Matrix Encoding) methods from APS. The APS provides an effective and generic pathway for developing efficient quantum algorithms for general non-unitary dynamics to achieve either optimal query complexity or fast-forwarding property, outperforming the existing algorithms for the same problems.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the homogeneous parts of Clifford and meson algebras and point out that for the Clifford algebra it is related to fermionic statistics, that is, to fermionic parastatistics of order 1 while for the meson algebra it is related to fermionic parastatistics of order 2. We extend these homogeneous algebras into corresponding algebras related to fermionic parastatistics of all orders. We then define correspondingly higher order generalizations of Clifford and meson algebras.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>

      <title>More on 5d Wilson Loops in Higher-Rank Theories and Blowup Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we further explore the construction and computation of expectation values for Wilson loops in higher-rank 5d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{C}_2 \times S_1$, by explicitly computing the Wilson loops via Chern-character insertion and qq-characters, including cases with the exceptional gauge group $G_2$. In particular, we propose a systematic way to write down the general blowup equations for Wilson loops by using the constraints from the one-form symmetry and low-instanton data from the instanton partition function. In addition, for one-instanton contributions in a large family of Wilson loop representations, we observe that they admit a $q_1q_2$-expansion, similar to the Hilbert-series structure of instanton partitions in pure gauge theories.</description>

      <title>$k$-Positivity and high-dimensional bound entanglement under symplectic group symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of $k$-positivity and Schmidt numbers for classes of linear maps and bipartite quantum states exhibiting symplectic group symmetry. Specifically, we consider (1) linear maps on $M_d(\mathbb{C})$ which are covariant under conjugation by unitary symplectic matrices $S$, and (2) $d\otimes d$ bipartite states which are invariant under $S\otimes S$ or $S\otimes \overline{S}$ actions, each parametrized by two real variables. We provide a complete characterization of all $k$-positivity and decomposability conditions for these maps and explicitly compute the Schmidt numbers for the corresponding bipartite states. In particular, our analysis yields a broad class of PPT states with Schmidt number $d/2$ and the first explicit constructions of (optimal) $k$-positive indecomposable linear maps for arbitrary $k=1,\ldots, d/2-1$, achieving the best-known bounds. Overall, our results offer a natural and analytically tractable framework in which both strong forms of positive indecomposability and high degrees of PPT entanglement can be studied systematically.
  We present two further applications of symplectic group symmetry. First, we show that the PPT-squared conjecture holds within the class of PPT linear maps that are either symplectic-covariant or conjugate-symplectic-covariant. Second, we resolve a conjecture of Pal and Vertesi concerning the optimal lower bound of the Sindici-Piani semidefinite program for PPT entanglement.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Multiple Polylogarithms with Arbitrary Arguments in \textsc{GiNaC}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the numerical evaluation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms for arbitrary arguments and to arbitrary precision. The cornerstone of our approach is a procedure to obtain a convergent $q$-series representation of elliptic multiple polylogarithms. Its coefficients are expressed in terms of ordinary multiple polylogarithms, which can be evaluated efficiently using existing libraries. In a series of preparation steps the elliptic polylogarithms are mapped into a region where the $q$-series converges rapidly. We also present an implementation of our algorithm into the \texttt{GiNaC} framework. This release constitutes the first public package capable of evaluating elliptic multiple polylogarithms to high precision and for arbitrary values of the arguments.</description>

      <title>v-Representability on a one-dimensional torus at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a previous result [Sutter et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 475202 (2024)] to give an explicit form of the set of $v$-representable densities on the one-dimensional torus with any fixed number of particles in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature. The particle interaction has to satisfy some mild assumptions but is kept entirely general otherwise. For densities, we consider the Sobolev space $H^1$ and exploit the convexity of the functionals. This leads to a broader set of potentials than the usual $L^p$ spaces and encompasses distributions. By including temperature and thus considering all excited states in the Gibbs ensemble, G\^ateaux differentiability of the thermal universal functional is guaranteed. This yields $v$-representability and it is demonstrated that the given set of $v$-representable densities is even maximal.</description>

      <title>Egorov-Type Semiclassical Limits for Open Quantum Systems with a Bi-Lindblad Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a bridge between bi-Hamiltonian structures of Poisson-Lie type, contact Hamiltonian dynamics, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) formalism for quantum open systems. On the classical side, we consider bi-Hamiltonian systems defined by a Poisson pencil with non-trivial invariants. Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior.</description>

Abstract: A book, concerning the classical restricted three body problem, and the approach to this old conundrum coming from the modern methods of symplectic and contact geometry. It is split into Part I (theoretical aspects), and Part II (practical aspects). The main themes are Floer theory, contact topology, symplectic dynamics, and astrodynamics (with a view towards space mission design).</description>

      <title>Generalised Fisher Information in Defective Fokker-Planck Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to introduce and investigate a generalised Fisher Information in the setting of linear Fokker-Planck equations. This functional, which depends on two functions instead of one, exhibits the same decay behaviour as the standard Fisher information, and allows us to investigate different parts of the Fokker-Planck solution via an appropriate decomposition. Focusing almost exclusively on Fokker-Planck equations with constant drift and diffusion matrices, we will use a modification of the well established Bakry-Emery method with this newly defined functional to provide an alternative proof to the sharp long time behaviour of relative entropies of solutions to such equations when the diffusion matrix is positive definite and the drift matrix is defective. This novel approach is different to previous techniques and relies on minimal spectral information on the Fokker-Planck operator, unlike the one presented the authors' previous work, where powerful tools from spectral theory were needed.</description>

      <title>Fused K-operators and the $q$-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter, so-called K-operators, within a general framework of universal K-matrices - an extended version of the approach introduced by Appel-Vlaar. Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in "non-semisimple" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. We finally discuss implications of our results on the K-operators for quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Difference Approximation with ADI Scheme for Two-dimensional Keller-Segel Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Keller-Segel systems are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations used to model chemotaxis in biology. In this paper, we propose two alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes to solve the 2D Keller-Segel systems directly with minimal computational cost, while preserving positivity, energy dissipation law and mass conservation. One scheme unconditionally preserves positivity, while the other does so conditionally. Both schemes achieve second-order accuracy in space, with the former being first-order accuracy in time and the latter second-order accuracy in time. Besides, the former scheme preserves the energy dissipation law asymptotically. We validate these results through numerical experiments, and also compare the efficiency of our schemes with the standard five-point scheme, demonstrating that our approaches effectively reduce computational costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore topological manipulations in one spatial dimension, which are defined for a system with a global symmetry and map the system to another one with a dual symmetry. In particular, we discuss fusion category symmetries enhanced by the invariance of the actions of topological manipulations, i.e., self-$G$-alities for topological manipulations. Based on the self-$G$-ality conditions, we provide LSM-type constraints on the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. We clarify the relationship between different enhanced symmetries and introduce the notion of $\textit{codimension-two transitions}$. We explore concrete lattice models for such self-$G$-alities and find how the self-$G$-ality structures match the IR critical theories.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of maps with tight boundaries and the Zhukovsky transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider maps with tight boundaries, i.e. maps whose boundaries have minimal length in their homotopy class, and discuss the properties of their generating functions $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ for fixed genus $g$ and prescribed boundary lengths $\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n$, with a control on the degrees of inner faces. We find that these series appear as coefficients in the expansion of $\omega^{(g)}_n(z_1,\ldots,z_n)$, a fundamental quantity in the Eynard-Orantin theory of topological recursion, thereby providing a combinatorial interpretation of the Zhukovsky transformation used in this context. This interpretation results from the so-called trumpet decomposition of maps with arbitrary boundaries. In the planar bipartite case, we obtain a fully explicit formula for $T^{(0)}_{2\ell_1,\ldots,2\ell_n}$ from the Collet-Fusy formula. We also find recursion relations satisfied by $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$, which consist in adding an extra tight boundary, keeping the genus $g$ fixed. Building on a result of Norbury and Scott, we show that $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ is equal to a parity-dependent quasi-polynomial in $\ell_1^2,\ldots,\ell_n^2$ times a simple power of the basic generating function $R$. In passing, we provide a bijective derivation in the case $(g,n)=(0,3)$, generalizing a recent construction of ours to the non bipartite case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is of great interest to understand the thermalization of open quantum many-body systems, and how quantum computers are able to efficiently simulate that process. A recently introduced disispative evolution, inspired by existing models of open system thermalization, has been shown to be efficiently implementable on a quantum computer. Here, we prove that, at high enough temperatures, this evolution reaches the Gibbs state in time scaling logarithmically with system size. The result holds for Hamiltonians that satisfy the Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice, and includes long-range systems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the rapid mixing property of high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers, which is known to give the fastest possible speed for thermalization in the many-body setting. We then employ our result to the problem of estimating partition functions at high temperature, showing an improved performance over previous classical and quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We study propagation in a system consisting of two topological insulators without a magnetic field, whose interface is a non-compact, smooth, and connected curve without boundary. The dynamics are governed by an adiabatic modulation of a Dirac operator with a smooth, effective variable mass. We determine the evolution of the semiclassical measure of the solution using a two-scale Wigner measure method, after reducing the Hamiltonian to a normal form.</description>

      <title>Shifted Poisson structures on higher Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a graphical calculus to determine the $n$-shifted Poisson structures on finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebras. When applied to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of an ordinary Lie algebra, we recover Safronov's result that the $(n=1)$- and $(n=2)$-shifted Poisson structures in this case are given by quasi-Lie bialgebra structures and, respectively, invariant symmetric tensors. We generalize these results to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a Lie $2$-algebra and obtain $n\in\{1,2,3,4\}$ shifted Poisson structures in this case, which we interpret as semi-classical data of `higher quantum groups'.</description>

      <title>Dualities of Gaudin models with irregular singularities for general linear Lie (super)algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an equivalence between the actions of the Gaudin algebras with irregular singularities for $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ on the Fock space of $d(p+m)$ bosonic and $d(q+n)$ fermionic oscillators. This establishes a duality of $(\mathfrak{gl}_d, \mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n})$ for Gaudin models. As an application, we show that the Gaudin algebra with irregular singularities for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ acts cyclically on each weight space of a certain class of infinite-dimensional modules over a direct sum of Takiff superalgebras over $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ and that the action is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum under a generic condition. We also study the classical versions of Gaudin algebras with irregular singularities and demonstrate a duality of $(\mathfrak{gl}_d, \mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n})$ for classical Gaudin models.</description>

      <title>Boundary Actions and Loop Groups: A Geometric Picture of Gauge Symmetries at Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work arXiv:2407.13556, we proposed an extended phase space structure at null infinity accommodating large gauge symmetries for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems in Yang-Mills, via dressing fields arising in the Stueckelberg procedure. Here, we give an explicit boundary action controlling the dynamics of these fields. This allows for a derivation from first principles of the associated charges, together with an explicit renormalization procedure when taking the limit to null and spatial infinity, matching with charges proposed in previous work. Using the language of fibre bundles, we relate the existence of Stueckelberg fields to the notion of extension/reduction of the structure group of a principal bundle, thereby deriving their transformation rules in a natural way, thus realising them as Goldstone-like objects. Finally, this allows us to give a geometric picture of the gauge transformation structure at the boundary, via a loop group coming from formal expansions in the coordinate transversal to the boundary.</description>

      <title>An algebra for covariant observers in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $d$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, consistency of the perturbative expansion necessitates imposing all second-order gravitational constraints associated with the $SO(1,d)$ isometry group, rather than restricting to the $\R\times SO(d-1)$ subgroup, to address linearization instability. Since generic de Sitter isometries do not preserve a fixed static patch, these constraints cannot be implemented within a fixed local algebra. In this paper, we develop a framework that consistently imposes all $SO(1,d)$ constraints while incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary timelike geodesics. This is achieved by introducing the concept of covariant observer,  whose geodesic transforms covariantly under the isometry group. Upon quantization, the observer is described by a superposition of geodesics, with the associated static patches fluctuating, providing a quantum reference frame $L^2(SO(1,d))$. We realize this structure in an action model in which a particle carries a set of conserved charges, each one corresponding to a generator of de Sitter isometry group, which parametrize its geodesic and upon quantization lead to a fluctuating geodesic.

Inspired by the timelike tube theorem, we propose that the algebra of observables accessible to a covariant observer is generated by all degrees of freedom within its fluctuating static patch, including quantum field modes and other observers, which are treated as part of the matter system. Imposing the $SO(1,d)$ constraints yields a gauge-invariant algebra that takes the form of an averaged modular crossed product algebra over static patches and configurations of other geodesics, thereby generalizing the notion of a local algebra associated with a fixed region to that of a fluctuating region. We show this algebra is of type II by explicitly constructing a faithful normal trace, leading to an observer-dependent notion of von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and proposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate the agreement between the algebraic and generalized entropies.</description>

      <title>Local fermion density in inhomogeneous free-fermion chains: a discrete WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.</description>

Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description>

      <title>Concentration and fluctuations of sine-Gordon measure around topological multi-soliton manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sine-Gordon measure defined on each homotopy class. The energy space decomposes into infinitely many such classes indexed by the topological degree $Q \in \mathbf{Z}$. Even though the sine-Gordon action admits no minimizer in homotopy classes with $|Q| \ge 2$, we prove that the Gibbs measure on each class nevertheless concentrates and exhibits Ornstein-Uhlenbeck fluctuations near the multi-soliton manifold in the joint low-temperature and infinite-volume limit. Moreover, we show that soliton collisions are unlikely events, so that typical states consist of solitons separated at an appropriate scale. Finally, we identify the joint distribution of the multi-soliton centers as the ordered statistics of independent uniform random variables, so that each soliton's location follows a Beta distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum mixing on large Schreier graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove quantum ergodicity and quantum mixing for sequences of finite Schreier graphs converging to an infinite Cayley graph whose adjacency operator has absolutely continuous spectrum. Under Benjamini-Schramm convergence (or strong convergence in distribution), we show that correlations between eigenvectors at distinct energies vanish asymptotically when tested against a broad class of local observables. Our results apply to all orthonormal eigenbases and do not require tree-like structure or periodicity of the limiting graph, unlike previous approaches based on non-backtracking operators or Floquet theory. The proof introduces a new framework for quantum ergodicity, based on trace identities, resolvent approximations and representation-theoretic techniques and extends to certain families of non-regular graphs. We illustrate the assumptions and consequences of our theorems on Schreier graphs arising from free products of groups, right-angled Coxeter groups and lifts of a fixed base graph.</description>

      <title>Tame Complexity of Effective Field Theories in the Quantum Gravity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of logical noise from syndrome data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing errors in quantum circuits is essential for device calibration, yet detecting rare error events requires a large number of samples. This challenge is particularly severe in calibrating fault-tolerant, error-corrected circuits, where logical error probabilities are suppressed to higher order relative to physical noise and are therefore difficult to calibrate through direct logical measurements. Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking. Our results establish syndrome-based learning as a practical approach to characterizing the logical channel in fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in non-Euclidean geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, extending the work of Gal'perin (Comm. Math. Phys. 154: 63-84, 1993), we investigate generalizations of the concepts of centroids and static equilibrium points of a convex body in spherical, hyperbolic and normed spaces. In addition, we examine the minimum number of equilibrium points a $2$- or $3$-dimensional convex body can have in these spaces. In particular, we show that every plane convex body in any of these spaces has at least four equilibrium points, and that there are mono-monostatic convex bodies in $3$-dimensional spherical, hyperbolic, and certain normed spaces. Our results are generalizations of results of Domokos, Papadopoulos and Ruina (J. Elasticity 36: 59-66, 1994), and V\'arkonyi and Domokos (J. Nonlinear Sci. 16: 255-281, 2006) for convex bodies in Euclidean space.</description>
