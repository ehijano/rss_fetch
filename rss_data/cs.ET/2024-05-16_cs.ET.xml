      <title>TunnelSense: Low-power, Non-Contact Sensing using Tunnel Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing the motion of physical objects in an environment enables numerous applications, from tracking occupancy in buildings and monitoring vital signs to diagnosing faults in machines. Typically, these application scenarios involve attaching a sensor, such as an accelerometer, to the object of interest, like a wearable device that tracks our steps. However, many of these scenarios require tracking motion in a noncontact manner where the sensor is not in touch with the object. A sensor in such a scenario observes variations in radio, light, acoustic, and infrared fields disturbed by the object's motion. Current noncontact sensing mechanisms often require substantial energy and involve complex processing on sophisticated hardware. We present TunnelSense, a novel mechanism that rethinks noncontact sensing using tunnel diode oscillators. They are highly sensitive to changes in their electromagnetic environments. The motion of an object near a tunnel diode oscillator induces corresponding changes in its resonant frequency and thus in the generated radio waves. Additionally, the low-power characteristics of the tunnel diode allow tags designed using them to operate on less than 100microwatt of power consumption and with a biasing voltage starting at 70 millivolt. This enables prolonged tag operation on a small battery or energy harvested from the environment. Among numerous applications enabled by the TunnelSense system, this work demonstrates its ability to detect breathing at distances up to 30 centimeter between the subject and the TunnelSense tag.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Education for Computer Science Students: Bridging the Gap with Layered Learning and Intuitive Analogies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a transformative potential for the world of computing. However, integrating this technology into the curriculum for computer science students who lack prior exposure to quantum mechanics and advanced mathematics remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a scaffolded learning approach aimed at equipping computer science students with essential quantum principles. By introducing foundational quantum concepts through relatable analogies and a layered learning approach based on classical computation, this approach seeks to bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing. This differs from previous approaches which build quantum computing fundamentals from the prerequisite of linear algebra and mathematics. The paper offers a considered set of intuitive analogies for foundation quantum concepts including entanglement, superposition, quantum data structures and quantum algorithms. These analogies coupled with a computing-based layered learning approach, lay the groundwork for a comprehensive teaching methodology tailored for undergraduate third level computer science students.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Magnonic Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonic systems have been a major area of research interest due to their potential benefits in speed and lower power consumption compared to traditional computing. One particular area that they may be of advantage is as Physical Reservoir Computers in machine learning models. In this work, we build on an established design for using an Auto-Oscillation Ring as a reservoir computer by introducing a simple neural network midstream and introduce an additional design using a spin wave guide with a scattering regime for processing data with different types of inputs. We simulate these designs on the new micro magnetic simulation software, Magnum.np, and show that the designs are capable of performing on various real world data sets comparably or better than traditional dense neural networks.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Voltage Offsets in Memcapacitive Bio-Membranes Enable High-Performance Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a brain-inspired machine learning framework for processing temporal data by mapping inputs into high-dimensional spaces. Physical reservoir computers (PRCs) leverage native fading memory and nonlinearity in physical substrates, including atomic switches, photonics, volatile memristors, and, recently, memcapacitors, to achieve efficient high-dimensional mapping. Traditional PRCs often consist of homogeneous device arrays, which rely on input encoding methods and large stochastic device-to-device variations for increased nonlinearity and high-dimensional mapping. These approaches incur high pre-processing costs and restrict real-time deployment. Here, we introduce a novel heterogeneous memcapacitor-based PRC that exploits internal voltage offsets to enable both monotonic and non-monotonic input-state correlations crucial for efficient high-dimensional transformations. We demonstrate our approach's efficacy by predicting a second-order nonlinear dynamical system with an extremely low prediction error (0.00018). Additionally, we predict a chaotic H\'enon map, achieving a low normalized root mean square error (0.080). Unlike previous PRCs, such errors are achieved without input encoding methods, underscoring the power of distinct input-state correlations. Most importantly, we generalize our approach to other neuromorphic devices that lack inherent voltage offsets using externally applied offsets to realize various input-state correlations. Our approach and unprecedented performance are a major milestone towards high-performance full in-materia PRCs.</description>

      <title>Using an Evolutionary Algorithm to Create (MAX)-3SAT QUBOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common way of solving satisfiability instances with quantum methods is to transform these instances into instances of QUBO, which in itself is a potentially difficult and expensive task. State-of-the-art transformations from MAX-3SAT to QUBO currently work by mapping clauses of a 3SAT formula associated with the MAX-3SAT instance to an instance of QUBO and combining the resulting QUBOs into a single QUBO instance representing the whole MAX-3SAT instance. As creating these transformations is currently done manually or via exhaustive search methods and, therefore, algorithmically inefficient, we see potential for including search-based optimization. In this paper, we propose two methods of using evolutionary algorithms to automatically create QUBO representations of MAX-3SAT problems. We evaluate our created QUBOs on 500 and 1000-clause 3SAT formulae and find competitive performance to state-of-the-art baselines when using both classical and quantum annealing solvers.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with Qiskit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe Qiskit, a software development kit for quantum information science. We discuss the key design decisions that have shaped its development, and examine the software architecture and its core components. We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for solving a problem in condensed matter physics on a quantum computer that serves to highlight some of Qiskit's capabilities, for example the representation and optimization of circuits at various abstraction levels, its scalability and retargetability to new gates, and the use of quantum-classical computations via dynamic circuits. Lastly, we discuss some of the ecosystem of tools and plugins that extend Qiskit for various tasks, and the future ahead.</description>
