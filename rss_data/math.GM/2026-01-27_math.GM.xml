      <title>An infinite set of one-range addition theorems without an infinite second series, for Slater orbitals and it derivatives, applicable more than one coordinate system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addition theorems have been indispensable tools for the reduction of quantum transition amplitudes. They are normally utilized at the start of the process to move the angular dependence within plane waves and Coulomb potentials, and the like, into a sum over Spherical Harmonics that allows the angular integration to be carried out. These have historically been ``two-range'' addition theorems, characterized by the two-fold notation $r_{&gt;}=Max[r_{1},r_{2}]$ and $r_{&lt;}=Min[r_{1},r_{2}]$ and comprising a single infinite series. More recently, ``one-range'' addition theorems have been created that have no such piecewise notation, but at the cost of a second infinite series. We use a very different approach to derive an infinite set of addition theorems for Slater orbitals and its derivatives that retain the one-range variable dependence but have, at worst, a finite second series rather than an infinite one. Also unlike previous addition theorems, they are applicable to more than one coordinate system. One of these addition theorem may also be used for Yukawa-like functions that may appear late in the reduction of amplitude integrals and we show its utility for an integral that has stubbornly defied reduction to analytic form for nearly sixty years.</description>

      <title>Sharp $L^p$ Convergence for Mirror-Degenerate Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze weighted $L^p$ convergence for the truncated reconstruction operator in the rank-one non-symmetric Heckman--Opdam setting. After localization at the mirror, the operator admits a rigid structural decomposition and reduces, up to bounded terms, to a rank-one functional. Boundedness on $L^p(w)$ is characterized by the mirror-local integrability of $w^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Weakly and Strongly Admissible Triplets for a Collatz-Type Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of Collatz-like problems associated with weakly and strongly admissible triplets of integers. This framework extends the classical Collatz mapping, providing a systematic method for generating triplets with convergence to cycles, thereby bypassing the difficulties inherent in solving Diophantine equations. We introduce several special families of admissible triplets and establish general structural properties. In addition, we propose conjectures that generalize the classical Collatz conjecture. Bounds on the lengths of potential non-trivial cycles are derived and analyzed, and two algorithms are presented for computing lower bounds on cycle lengths. Finally, experimental tests are given to illustrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Some Geometric Properties of the Yff Points of a Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yff points of a triangle were introduced by Peter Yff in 1963. Since then, very few new facts have been discovered about these points. We present some geometrical properties of the Yff points of various shaped triangles which were discovered and proved by computer.</description>
