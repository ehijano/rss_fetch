      <title>El monoide de endomorfismos de $G$-conjuntos: estructuras y otras propiedades algebraicas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the action of a group $G$ on a set $X$, an endomorphism of $X$ is a function $f:X \rightarrow X$ which is $G$-equivariant, that is, it commutes with the action, i.e., $f(g\cdot x)= g\cdot f(x)$, for all $x\in X$. The set of endomorphisms of a $G$-set $X$ is a monoid, with the composition of functions , which we will denote $\mathrm{End}_{G}(X)$. Given subsets $U,N\subseteq M$, we say that $U$ generates $M$ modulo $N$ if it is satisfied that $M= \langle U \cup N \rangle$. The relative rank of M modulo N is the minimum cardinality of a set $U$ to generate $M$ modulo $N$. In this work we address the particular case in which $G$ and $X$ are finite to calculate the relative rank of the endomorphism monoid $\mathrm{End}_{G}(X)$ modulo its group of units, denoted by $\mathrm{Aut}_{G}(X)$. We also address structure situations, such as isomorphisms of $\mathrm{Aut}_{G}(X)$ and $\mathrm{End}_{G}(X)$ with other known structures.</description>

      <title>A generalized theory of ideals and algebraic substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2011, a topic containing the concepts of upper and lower periodic subsets of (basic) algebraic structures was introduced and studied. The concept of ``upper periodic subsets'' can be considered as a generalized topic of ideals and sub-structures (e.g., subgroups, sub-semigroups, sub-magmas, sub-rings, etc.). Hence, it can be improved to a theory in every algebraic structure which extends many basic concepts including the ideals. This paper follows the mentioned goals and studies related to algebraic and topological aspects. For this purpose, first, we state an improved fundamental theorem about the unique direct representation of left upper periodic subsets and then introduce some extensions and generalizations. As a result of the study, we classify sub-semigroups and subgroups of real numbers and introduce some related topics and concenterable upper periodic subsets. We end the study with many research projects and some future directions of the theory.</description>

      <title>On the minimal (edge) connectivity of graphs and its applications to power graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier work, finite groups whose power graphs are minimally edge connected have been classified. In this article, first we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary graph to be minimally edge connected. Consequently, we characterize finite groups whose enhanced power graphs and order superpower graphs, respectively, are minimally edge connected. Moreover, for a finite non-cyclic group $G$, we prove that $G$ is an elementary abelian $2$-group if and only if its enhanced power graph is minimally connected. Also, we show that $G$ is a finite $p$-group if and only if its order superpower graph is minimally connected. Finally, we characterize all the finite nilpotent groups such that the minimum degree and the vertex connectivity of their order superpower graphs are equal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a finitely presented group virtually admits a planar Cayley graph if and only if it is asymptotically minor-excluded, partially answering a conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Half grid diagrams and Thompson links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define half grid diagrams and prove every link is half grid presentable by constructing a canonical half grid pair (which gives rise to a grid diagram of some special type) associated with an element in the oriented Thompson group. We show that this half grid construction is equivalent to Jones' construction of oriented Thompson links. Using this equivalence, we relate the (oriented) Thompson index to several classical topological link invariants, and give both the lower and upper bounds of the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of a knot in terms of the oriented Thompson index. Moreover, we give a one-to-one correspondence between half grid diagrams and elements in symmetric groups and give a new description of link group using two elements in a symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Train Tracks on Graphs of Groups and Outer Automorphisms of Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.00164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds. In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups satisfying this condition may be represented by irreducible train track maps in the sense of Bestvina-Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs). Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well. Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass-Serre theory of groups acting on trees, morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof. We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument of Qing-Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic. As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin: outer automorphisms of finitely-generated word hyperbolic groups satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen-Thurston "periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov." At the end of the thesis we collect some open problems we find interesting.</description>

      <title>Normal structure spaces of groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can we do a topological study of various classes of normal subgroups endowed with a hull-kernel-type topology? In this paper, we have provided an answer to this question. We have introduced as well a new class of normal subgroups called primitive subgroups. Separation axioms, compactness, connectedness, and continuities of these spaces have been studied. We have concluded with the question of determining spectral spaces among them.</description>

      <title>Coarse obstructions to cocompact cubulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide geometric methods to both lower- and upper-bound the large-scale dimension of CAT(0) cube complexes quasiisometric to a given group $G$. When these bounds overlap, this provides obstructions to $G$ being cocompactly cubulated. More strongly, it prevents $G$ from being a coarse median space.
  As applications, we show that many free-by-cyclic groups cannot be cocompactly cubulated, and that any tubular group with a coarse median is virtually compact special.</description>

      <title>Isbell's subfactor projections in a noetherian form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the 1979 work of Isbell on subfactors of groups and their projections, which he uses to establish a stronger formulation of the butterfly lemma and its consequence, the refinement theorem for subnormal series of subgroups. We point out an error in the second part of Isbell's refinement theorem, but show that the rest of his results can be extended to the general self-dual context of a noetherian form, which includes in its scope all semi-abelian categories as well as all Grandis exact categories. Furthermore, we show that Isbell's formulations of the butterfly lemma and the refinement theorem amount to canonicity of isomorphisms established in these results.</description>

      <title>Some results on Nilpotency, Solvability and Frattini Theory for Bicommutative, Assosymmetric and Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper starts by showing that for algebras in a certain class the concepts of weak nilpotency and nilpotency coincide. It goes on to describe some solvability and nilpotency properties of bicommutative algebras, of assosymmetric and of Novikov algebras and to introduce a Frattini theory for all of them. A description is also given for semisimple bicommutative algebras over any field.</description>
