      <title>Hybrid Vector Auto Regression and Neural Network Model for Order Flow Imbalance Prediction in High Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high frequency trading, accurate prediction of Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) is crucial for understanding market dynamics and maintaining liquidity. This paper introduces a hybrid predictive model that combines Vector Auto Regression (VAR) with a simple feedforward neural network (FNN) to forecast OFI and assess trading intensity. The VAR component captures linear dependencies, while residuals are fed into the FNN to model non-linear patterns, enabling a comprehensive approach to OFI prediction. Additionally, the model calculates the intensity on the Buy or Sell side, providing insights into which side holds greater trading pressure. These insights facilitate the development of trading strategies by identifying periods of high buy or sell intensity. Using both synthetic and real trading data from Binance, we demonstrate that the hybrid model offers significant improvements in predictive accuracy and enhances strategic decision-making based on OFI dynamics. Furthermore, we compare the hybrid models performance with standalone FNN and VAR models, showing that the hybrid approach achieves superior forecasting accuracy across both synthetic and real datasets, making it the most effective model for OFI prediction in high frequency trading.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Qualitative Insights: Leveraging LLMs to Market Predict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to transform financial analytics by integrating numerical and textual data. However, challenges such as insufficient context when fusing multimodal information and the difficulty in measuring the utility of qualitative outputs, which LLMs generate as text, have limited their effectiveness in tasks such as financial forecasting. This study addresses these challenges by leveraging daily reports from securities firms to create high-quality contextual information. The reports are segmented into text-based key factors and combined with numerical data, such as price information, to form context sets. By dynamically updating few-shot examples based on the query time, the sets incorporate the latest information, forming a highly relevant set closely aligned with the query point. Additionally, a crafted prompt is designed to assign scores to the key factors, converting qualitative insights into quantitative results. The derived scores undergo a scaling process, transforming them into real-world values that are used for prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs outperform time-series models in market forecasting, though challenges such as imperfect reproducibility and limited explainability remain.</description>

      <title>FinRobot: AI Agent for Equity Research and Valuation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As financial markets grow increasingly complex, there is a rising need for automated tools that can effectively assist human analysts in equity research, particularly within sell-side research. While Generative AI (GenAI) has attracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall short due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for discretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new data in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical value for investors.
  This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically designed for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate the comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around three specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data sources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics an analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT Agent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and report. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise numerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk assessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research remains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information. Unlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright Reports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major brokerage firms and fundamental research vendors. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github. com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Making: the case of Pegged Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to model the exchange rate dynamics between two intrinsically linked cryptoassets, such as stablecoins pegged to the same fiat currency or a liquid staking token and its associated native token. Our approach employs multi-level nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, for which we derive key properties and develop calibration and filtering techniques. Then, we design an automated market maker (AMM) model specifically tailored for the swapping of closely related cryptoassets. Distinct from existing models, our AMM leverages the unique exchange rate dynamics provided by the multi-level nested OU processes, enabling more precise risk management and enhanced liquidity provision. We validate the model through numerical simulations using real-world data for the USDC/USDT and wstETH/WETH pairs, demonstrating that it consistently yields efficient quotes. This approach offers significant potential to improve liquidity in markets for pegged assets.</description>

      <title>Analyst Reports and Stock Performance: Evidence from the Chinese Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article applies natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify textual information to predict stock performance. Using an extensive dataset of Chinese analyst reports and employing a customized BERT deep learning model for Chinese text, this study categorizes the sentiment of the reports as positive, neutral, or negative. The findings underscore the predictive capacity of this sentiment indicator for stock volatility, excess returns, and trading volume. Specifically, analyst reports with strong positive sentiment will increase excess return and intraday volatility, and vice versa, reports with strong negative sentiment also increase volatility and trading volume, but decrease future excess return. The magnitude of this effect is greater for positive sentiment reports than for negative sentiment reports. This article contributes to the empirical literature on sentiment analysis and the response of the stock market to news in the Chinese stock market.</description>
