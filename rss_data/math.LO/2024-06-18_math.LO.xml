      <title>On all numbers great and small (Topological fields of Conway's numbers and their completions)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper Class $\bf{No}$ of all Conway's numbers $\cite{l3}$ is considered as a region of investigation. It turns out to be a total ordered Field (i.e., a field whose domain is a proper Class) and this totally, or linear ordered Class, containing the real numbers ${\mathbb R}$ and the ordinal numbers {\bf On}.
  For any subfield $F$ of $\bf{No}$, i.e., $F$ is a set nor proper class, considered with topology induced by a linear ordering on $F$ a completion $\tilde F$ is constructed; in particular, for $\zeta=\omega^{\omega^\mu}$, $0\leq\mu&lt;\Omega$, and for a specially defined subfield $F={\mathbb P}_\zeta\subset{\bf No}$ a complete subfield ${\mathbb R}_\zeta\subset{\bf No}$ is defined as $\tilde {\mathbb P}_\zeta$.
  Fundamental (Cauchy) sequences $(x_\alpha)_{0\leq\alpha&lt;\zeta}$ are considered in a subfield $F\subset {\mathbb P}_\zeta\subset{\bf No}$, where $\zeta$ is the smallest ordinal number which does not belong to $F$, and they are the main instrument in the paper.
  A fragment of Mathematical Analysis in ${\mathbb R}_\zeta$ is given and two of its non-trivial results are presented: every positive number $x\in{\mathbb R}_\zeta$ has a unique $n$-th root in ${\mathbb R}_\zeta$, for each positive integer $n$ and every odd-degree polynomial with coefficients in ${\mathbb R}_\zeta$ has a root in ${\mathbb R}_\zeta$. Hence so-called fundamental theorem of algebra: the ring ${\mathbb R}_\zeta[i]\stackrel{def}{=}{\mathbb C}_\zeta$ of all numbers of the form $x+iy$ ($x,y\in{\mathbb R}_\zeta$), $i^2=-1$, is an algebraically closed field.</description>

      <title>Axiom $\mathcal{A}$ and supercompactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce a model where every supercompact cardinal is $C^{(1)}$-supercompact with inaccessible targets. This is a significant improvement of the main identity-crises configuration obtained in \cite{HMP} and provides a definitive answer to a question of Bagaria \cite[p.19]{Bag}. This configuration is a consequence of a new axiom we introduce -- called $\mathcal{A}$ -- which is showed to be compatible with Woodin's $I_0$ cardinals. We also answer a question of V. Gitman and G. Goldberg on the relationship between supercompactness and cardinal-preserving extendibility. As an incidental result, we prove a theorem suggesting that supercompactness is the strongest large-cardinal notion preserved by Radin forcing.</description>

      <title>Aspects of automatic continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general overview of the phenomenon of automatic continuity of homomorphisms between Polish groups is given. In particular, we study variants and improvements of the closed graph theorem, applying these to the problem of continuity of universally measurable homomorphisms and also to gauge the amount of choice needed to construct discontinuous homomorphisms between Polish groups. Furthermore, we provide a simple proof of automatic continuity in the context of homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and a complete reworking of automatic continuity theory in the context of isometry groups of highly homogeneous complete metric structures.</description>

      <title>Heritability of K\H{o}nig's Property from finite edge sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hypergraph $H = (V,E)$ is said to have K\H{o}nig's Property if there is a matching $M\subseteq E$ and $S\subseteq V$ such that $|S \cap e| = 1$ for all $e\in M$, and $S$ is a vertex cover of $H$. Aharoni posed the question whether K\H{o}nig's Property is inheritable from finite subsets of $E$. We provide a negative answer and investigate similar questions for weaker properties.</description>

      <title>Medvedev degrees of subshifts on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Medvedev degree of a subshift is a dynamical invariant of computable origin that can be used to compare the complexity of subshifts that contain only uncomputable configurations. We develop theory to describe how these degrees can be transferred from one group to another through algebraic and geometric relations, such as quotients, subgroups, translation-like actions and quasi-isometries.
  We use the aforementioned tools to study the possible values taken by this invariant on subshifts of finite type on some finitely generated groups. We obtain a full classification for some classes, such as virtually polycyclic groups and branch groups with decidable word problem. We also show that all groups which are quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane admit SFTs with nonzero Medvedev degree. Furthermore, we provide a classification of the degrees of sofic subshifts for several classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's tenth problem for rings of holomorphic functions of bounded order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main open problems in the context of extensions of Hilbert's tenth problem (HTP) is the case of the ring of complex entire functions in one variable. Our main result provides a step towards an answer: For every $\rho\ge 0$, we give a negative solution to the analogue of HTP in the ring of complex entire functions in one variable of growth order at most $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Visceral theories without assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a theory with a definable topology. $T$ is t-minimal in the sense of Mathews if every definable set in one variable has finite boundary. If $T$ is t-minimal, we show that there is a good dimension theory for definable sets, satisfying properties similar to dp-rank in dp-minimal theories, with one key exception: the dimension of $\operatorname{dom}(f)$ can be less than the dimension of $\operatorname{im}(f)$ for a definable function $f$. Using the dimension theory, we show that any definable field in a t-minimal theory is perfect.
  We then specialize to the case where $T$ is visceral in the sense of Dolich and Goodrick, meaning that $T$ is t-minimal and the definable topology comes from a definable uniformity (i.e., a definable uniform structure). We show that almost all of Dolich and Goodrick's tame topology theorems for visceral theories hold without their additional assumptions of definable finite choice (DFC) and no space-filling functions (NSFF). Lastly, we produce an example of a visceral theory with a space-filling curve, answering a question of Dolich and Goodrick.</description>

      <title>Generic differentiability and $P$-minimal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove generic differentiability in $P$-minimal theories, strengthening an earlier result of Kuijpers and Leenknegt. Using this, we prove Onshuus and Pillay's $P$-minimal analogue of Pillay's conjectures on o-minimal groups. Specifically, let $G$ be an $n$-dimensional definable group in a highly saturated model $M$ of a $P$-minimal theory. Then there is an open definable subgroup $H \subseteq G$ such that $H$ is compactly dominated by $H/H^{00}$, and $H/H^{00}$ is a $p$-adic Lie group of the expected dimension. Additionally, the generic differentiability theorem immediately implies a classification of interpretable fields in $P$-minimal theories, by work of Halevi, Hasson, and Peterzil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various universal-existential fragments of first-order theories of fields, in particular of function fields and of equicharacteristic henselian valued fields. For example we discuss to what extent the theory of a field k determines the universal-existential theories of the rational function field over k and of the field of Laurent series over k, and we find various many-one reductions between such fragments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lefthanded Lov\'asz local lemma (LLLL) is a generalization of the Lov\'asz local lemma (LLL), a powerful technique from the probabilistic method. We prove a computable version of the LLLL and use it to effectivize a collection of results on the existence of certain types of non-repetitive sequences via the LLL and LLLL. This represents the first constructive proof of these results.</description>

      <title>Quotients, pure existential completions and arithmetic universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new description of Joyal's arithmetic universes through a characterization of the exact and regular completions of pure existential completions. We show that the regular and exact completions of the pure existential completion of an elementary doctrine $P$ are equivalent to the $\mathsf{reg}/\mathsf{lex}$ and $\mathsf{ex}/\mathsf{lex}$-completions, respectively, of the category of predicates of $P$. This result generalizes a previous one by the first author with F. Pasquali and G. Rosolini about doctrines equipped with Hilbert's $\epsilon$-operators. Thanks to this characterization, each arithmetic universe in the sense of Joyal can be seen as the exact completion of the pure existential completion of the doctrine of predicates of its Skolem theory. In particular, the initial arithmetic universe in the standard category of ZFC-sets turns out to be the completion with exact quotients of the doctrine of recursively enumerable predicates.</description>
