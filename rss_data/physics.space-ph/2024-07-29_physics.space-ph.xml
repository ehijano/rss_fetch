      <title>Solar activity and extreme rainfall over Kerala, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala, India. Kerala receives minimum and maximum rainfall during the winter and monsoon seasons, respectively. Sunspot number, F10.7 Index, and cosmic ray intensity are the solar indices considered and their variations with rainfall were studied over a period of 57 years (1965-2021), i.e., starting from Solar Cycle 20. For each solar cycle, correlative studies are performed and correlation coefficients are calculated. We find that rainfall in Kerala is correlated with sunspot activity, but with varying degrees of significance. During Solar Cycle 21, rainfall and solar activity are correlated with high significance during both winter and monsoon seasons. The variation of different solar indices with rainfall is studied. The winter season showed a better link between the sun and rainfall than the monsoon season. The years with rainfall surplus and deficiency are calculated and compared with the solar indices. We find that the years with rainfall excess and deficit mostly occur in the years around solar maximum or minimum (within $\pm$2 years). We hypothesise a physical relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala that contributes to their predictability.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

      <title>Not So Fast: A New Catalog of Meteor Persistent Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a nearly two year long campaign to detect and analyze meteor persistent trains (PTs) - self-emitting phenomena which can linger up to an hour after their parent meteor. The modern understanding of PTs has been primarily developed from the Leonid storms at the turn of the century; our goal was to assess the validity of these conclusions using a diverse sample of meteors with a wide range of velocities and magnitudes. To this end, year-round observations were recorded by the Widefield Persistent Train camera, 2nd edition (WiPT2) and were passed through a pipeline to filter out airplanes and flag potential meteors. These were classified by visual inspection based on the presence and duration of trains. Observed meteors were cross-referenced with the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database, which independently detects and calculates meteor parameters, enabling statistical analysis of PT-leaving meteors. There were 4726 meteors codetected by the GMN, with 636 of these leaving trains. Among these were a large population of slow, dim meteors that left PTs; these slower meteors had a greater train production rate relative to their faster counterparts. Unlike prior research, we did not find a clear magnitude cutoff or a strong association with fast meteor showers. Additionally, we note several interesting trends not previously reported, which include PT eligibility being primarily determined by a meteor's terminal height and an apparent dynamical origin dependence that likely reflects physical meteoroid properties.</description>
