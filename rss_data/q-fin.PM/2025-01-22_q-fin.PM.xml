      <title>Optimizing Portfolio Performance through Clustering and Sharpe Ratio-Based Optimization: A Comparative Backtesting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12074v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing portfolio performance is a fundamental challenge in financial modeling, requiring the integration of advanced clustering techniques and data-driven optimization strategies. This paper introduces a comparative backtesting approach that combines clustering-based portfolio segmentation and Sharpe ratio-based optimization to enhance investment decision-making. First, we segment a diverse set of financial assets into clusters based on their historical log-returns using K-Means clustering. This segmentation enables the grouping of assets with similar return characteristics, facilitating targeted portfolio construction. Next, for each cluster, we apply a Sharpe ratio-based optimization model to derive optimal weights that maximize risk-adjusted returns. Unlike traditional mean-variance optimization, this approach directly incorporates the trade-off between returns and volatility, resulting in a more balanced allocation of resources within each cluster. The proposed framework is evaluated through a backtesting study using historical data spanning multiple asset classes. Optimized portfolios for each cluster are constructed and their cumulative returns are compared over time against a traditional equal-weighted benchmark portfolio.</description>

      <title>Exponential utility maximization in small/large financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining utility maximizing optimal portfolios in closed form is a challenging issue when the return vector follows a more general distribution than the normal one. In this note, we give closed form expressions, in markets based on finitely many assets, for optimal portfolios that maximize the expected exponential utility when the return vector follows normal mean-variance mixture models. We then consider large financial markets based on normal mean-variance mixture models also and show that, under exponential utility, the optimal utilities based on small markets converge to the optimal utility in the large financial market. This result shows, in particular, that to reach optimal utility level investors need to diversify their portfolios to include infinitely many assets into their portfolio and with portfolios based on any set of only finitely many assets, they never be able to reach optimum level of utility. In this paper, we also consider portfolio optimization problems with more general class of utility functions and provide an easy-to-implement numerical procedure for locating optimal portfolios. Especially, our approach in this part of the paper reduces a high dimensional problem in locating optimal portfolio into a three dimensional problem for a general class of utility functions.</description>

      <title>Two-fund separation under hyperbolically distributed returns and concave utility function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portfolio selection problems that optimize expected utility are usually difficult to solve. If the number of assets in the portfolio is large, such expected utility maximization problems become even harder to solve numerically. Therefore, analytical expressions for optimal portfolios are always preferred. In our work, we study portfolio optimization problems under the expected utility criterion for a wide range of utility functions, assuming return vectors follow hyperbolic distributions. Our main result demonstrates that under this setup, the two-fund monetary separation holds. Specifically, an individual with any utility function from this broad class will always choose to hold the same portfolio of risky assets, only adjusting the mix between this portfolio and a riskless asset based on their initial wealth and the specific utility function used for decision making. We provide explicit expressions for this mutual fund of risky assets. As a result, in our economic model, an individual's optimal portfolio is expressed in closed form as a linear combination of the riskless asset and the mutual fund of risky assets. Additionally, we discuss expected utility maximization problems under exponential utility functions over any domain of the portfolio set. In this part of our work, we show that the optimal portfolio in any given convex domain of the portfolio set either lies on the boundary of the domain or is the unique globally optimal portfolio within the entire domain.</description>

      <title>Multi-Hypothesis Prediction for Portfolio Optimization: A Structured Ensemble Learning Approach to Risk Diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework for portfolio allocation based on multiple hypotheses prediction using structured ensemble models is presented. Portfolio optimization is formulated as an ensemble learning problem, where each predictor focuses on a specific asset or hypothesis. The portfolio weights are determined by optimizing the ensemble's parameters, using an equal-weighted portfolio as the target, serving as a canonical basis for the hypotheses. Diversity in learning among predictors is parametrically controlled, and their predictions form a structured input for the ensemble optimization model. The proposed methodology establishes a link between this source of learning diversity and portfolio risk diversification, enabling parametric control of portfolio diversification prior to the decision-making process. Moreover, the methodology demonstrates that the diversity in asset or hypothesis selection, based on predictions of future returns, before and independently of the ensemble learning stage, also contributes to the out-of-sample portfolio diversification. The sets of assets with more diverse but lower average return predictions are preferred over less diverse selections. The methodology enables parametric control of diversity in both the asset selection and learning stages, providing users with significant control over out-of-sample portfolio diversification prior to decision-making. Experiments validate the hypotheses across one-step and multi-step decisions for all parameter configurations and the structured model variants using equity portfolios.</description>

      <title>Sequential Portfolio Selection under Latent Side Information-Dependence Structure: Optimality and Universal Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the investment problem of constructing an optimal no-short sequential portfolio strategy in a market with a latent dependence structure between asset prices and partly unobservable side information, which is often high-dimensional. The results demonstrate that a dynamic strategy, which forms a portfolio based on perfect knowledge of the dependence structure and full market information over time, may not grow at a higher rate infinitely often than a constant strategy, which remains invariant over time. Specifically, if the market is stationary, implying that the dependence structure is statistically stable, the growth rate of an optimal dynamic strategy, utilizing the maximum capacity of the entire market information, almost surely decays over time into an equilibrium state, asymptotically converging to the growth rate of a constant strategy.
  Technically, this work reassesses the common belief that a constant strategy only attains the optimal limiting growth rate of dynamic strategies when the market process is identically and independently distributed. By analyzing the dynamic log-optimal portfolio strategy as the optimal benchmark in a stationary market with side information, we show that a random optimal constant strategy almost surely exists, even when a limiting growth rate for the dynamic strategy does not. Consequently, two approaches to learning algorithms for portfolio construction are discussed, demonstrating the safety of removing side information from the learning process while still guaranteeing an asymptotic growth rate comparable to that of the optimal dynamic strategy.</description>
