      <title>Physico-thermal and geochemical behavior and alteration of the Au indicator gangue hydrothermal quartz at the Kubi Gold Ore Deposits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altered and gangue quartz in hydrothermal veins from the Kubi Gold deposit in Dunkwa on Offin in the central region of Ghana are investigated for possible Au-associated indicator minerals and to provide the understanding and increase the knowledge of the mineral hosting and alteration processes in quartz. X-ray diffraction, air annealing furnace, differential scanning calorimetry, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy have been applied on different quartz types outcropping from surface and bedrocks at the Kubi Gold Mining to reveal the material properties at different temperatures. From the diffraction results of the fresh and annealed quartz samples, we find that the samples contain indicator and the impurity minerals iron disulfide, biotite, titanium oxide, and magnetite. These minerals, under oxidation process between 574-1400 {\deg}C temperatures experienced hematite alterations and a transformation from {\alpha}-quartz to \b{eta}-quartz and further to cristobalite as observed from the calorimetry scans for hydrothermally exposed materials. The energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed elemental components of Fe, S, Mg, K, Al, Ti, Na, Si, O, and Ca contained in the samples, and these are attributed to the impurity phase minerals observed in the diffraction. The findings also suggest that during the hydrothermal flow regime, impurity minerals and metals can be trapped by voids and faults. Under favorable temperature conditions, the trapped minerals can be altered to change color at different depositional stages by oxidation and reduction processes leading to hematite alteration which is a useful indicator mineral in mineral exploration.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of Seismic Monitoring Networks with Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring networks increasingly aim to assimilate data from a large number of diverse sensors covering many sensing modalities. Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks to identify data, sensor configurations, or experiments which can optimally reduce uncertainty and hence increase the performance of a monitoring network. Information theory guides OED by formulating the choice of experiment or sensor placement as an optimization problem that maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) about quantities of interest given prior knowledge and models of expected observation data. Therefore, within the context of seismo-acoustic monitoring, we can use Bayesian OED to configure sensor networks by choosing sensor locations, types, and fidelity in order to improve our ability to identify and locate seismic sources. In this work, we develop the framework necessary to use Bayesian OED to optimize a sensor network's ability to locate seismic events from arrival time data of detected seismic phases at the regional-scale. Bayesian OED requires four elements:
  1) A likelihood function that describes the distribution of detection and travel time data from the sensor network,
  2) A Bayesian solver that uses a prior and likelihood to identify the posterior distribution of seismic events given the data,
  3) An algorithm to compute EIG about seismic events over a dataset of hypothetical prior events,
  4) An optimizer that finds a sensor network which maximizes EIG.
  Once we have developed this framework, we explore many relevant questions to monitoring such as: how to trade off sensor fidelity and earth model uncertainty; how sensor types, number, and locations influence uncertainty; and how prior models and constraints influence sensor placement.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen diffusion in garnet: insights from atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Garnet has been widely used to decipher the pressure-temperature-time history of rocks, but its physical properties such as elasticity and diffusion are strongly affected by trace amounts of hydrogen. Experimental measurements of H diffusion in garnet are limited to room pressure. We use atomistic simulations to study H diffusion in perfect and defective garnet lattices, focusing on protonation defects at the Si and Mg sites, which are shown to be energetically favored. The ab-initio simulation of H diffusion is computationally challenging due to a transient trapping of H, which is overcome with machine learning techniques by training a deep neural network that encodes the interatomic potential. Our results show high mobility of hydrogen in defect free garnet lattices, whereas H diffusivity is significantly diminished in defective lattices. Tracer simulation focusing on H alone highlights the vital role of atomic vibrations of heavier atoms like Mg in the untrapping of H atoms. Two regimes of H diffusion are identified: a diffuser-dominated regime at high hydrogen content with low activation energies, due to saturation of vacancies by hydrogen, and a vacancy-dominated regime at low hydrogen content with high activation energies, due to trapping of H atoms at vacancy sites. These regimes account for experimental observations, such as a H-concentration dependent diffusivity and the discrepancy in activation energy between deprotonation and D-H exchange experiments. This study underpins the crucial role of vacancies in H diffusion and demonstrates the utility of machine-learned interatomic potentials in studying kinetic processes in the Earth's interior.</description>

      <title>More room at the top: how small buoys aim at the detailed dynamics of the air-sea interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air-sea exchange processes have been identified as essential for both short- and long-term atmospheric and ocean forecasts. The two phases of the fluid layer covering our planet interact across a vast range of scales that we need to explore to achieve a better understanding of the exchange processes. While satellites provide a distributed large-scale view of the sea surface situation, highly detailed measurements, e.g., from oceanographic towers, are necessarily local. The required intermediate solution (i.e., data that are both accurate and distributed) can be provided by swarms of miniature surface buoys. As size, weight, and cost are reduced, these can be deployed in large numbers to investigate specific processes that are at present only crudely parameterized in our models as a result of scarcity of good measurements. Perhaps the most crucial process is white-capping in stormy conditions, where air-sea exchanges are enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude. Other applications include wave-current interactions, wave-ice interactions, and plunging breakers in the coastal zone.
  Following a dedicated workshop, we summarize here the main findings and possibilities derived from the different approaches, and summarize the state of the art for a selection of miniature buoys. We list the solutions presented at the workshop, as well as other similar buoys, with their main characteristics and range of application. We describe the various possibilities of practical use and the scientific and engineering problems to be solved. Looking to the future, we also point out where the present technological improvements are leading to.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potential for serpentines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serpentines are layered hydrous magnesium silicates (MgO$\cdot$SiO$_2\cdot$H$_2$O) formed through serpentinization, a geochemical process that significantly alters the physical property of the mantle. They are hard to investigate experimentally and computationally due to the complexity of natural serpentine samples and the large number of atoms in the unit cell. We developed a machine learning (ML) potential for serpentine minerals based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation with the r$^2$SCAN meta-GGA functional for molecular dynamics simulation. We illustrate the success of this ML potential model in reproducing the high-temperature equation of states of several hydrous phases under the Earth's subduction zone conditions, including brucite, lizardite, and antigorite. In addition, we investigate the polymorphism of antigorite with periodicity $m$ = 13--24, which is believed to be all the naturally existent antigorite species. We found that antigorite with $m$ larger than 21 appears more stable than lizardite at low temperatures. This machine learning potential can be further applied to investigate more complex antigorite superstructures with multiple coexisting periodic waves.</description>
