      <title>Closed manifold surgery obstructions and the Oozing Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the description of surgery obstructions up to homotopy equivalence for closed oriented manifolds with finite fundamental group. New examples are presented of non-trivial obstructions for Arf invariant product formulas in codimensions $\geq 4$, which give counterexamples to the well-known ''Oozing Conjecture'' from the 1980's.</description>

      <title>Genera of two-component alternating links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the equality-type results of Ito--Takimura and Kindred for the non-orientable genera of alternating knots to the setting of two-component alternating links. We show that, for such links, a unified quantity capturing both orientable and non-orientable genera is completely determined by the splice sequence realizing the splice-unknotting number up to an explicit correction term.</description>

      <title>Delta-Unknotting Number for Pretzel Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Delta$-unknotting number for a knot is defined as the minimum number of $\Delta$-moves needed to deform the knot into the trivial knot. It is known that, for positive pretzel knots, the $\Delta$-unknotting number coincides with the second coefficient of their Conway polynomial. In this paper, we compute the $\Delta$-unknotting number for positive pretzel knots. Furthermore, we determine the $\Delta$-unknotting number for pretzel knots of type $P(-1, p_2, ..., p_n)$, where $p_i$ is a positive odd integer for $2 \leq i \leq n$ and $n$ is odd.</description>

Abstract: To assess the ability of current AI systems to correctly answer research-level mathematics questions, we share a set of ten math questions which have arisen naturally in the research process of the authors. The questions had not been shared publicly until now; the answers are known to the authors of the questions but will remain encrypted for a short time.</description>

      <title>Mapper-GIN: Lightweight Structural Graph Abstraction for Corrupted 3D Point Cloud Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust 3D point cloud classification is often pursued by scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation. We instead ask whether structural abstraction alone can improve robustness, and study a simple topology-inspired decomposition based on the Mapper algorithm. We propose Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline that partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, and followed by density-based clustering), constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network. On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.</description>

      <title>A Structural Equivalence of Symmetric TSP to a Constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a brief structural equivalence between the symmetric TSP and a constrained Group Steiner Tree Problem (cGSTP) defined on a simplicial incidence graph. Given the complete weighted graph on the city set V, we form the bipartite incidence graph between triangles and edges. Selecting an admissible, disk-like set of triangles induces a unique boundary cycle. With global connectivity and local regularity constraints, maximizing net weight in the cGSTP is exactly equivalent to minimizing the TSP tour length.</description>

      <title>Convex unions and completions from simplicial pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While intersections of convex sets are convex, their unions have rather complicated behavior. Some natural contexts where they appear include duality arguments involving boundaries of convex sets and valuations, which have an Euler characteristic-like structure. However, there are certain settings where the convexity property itself is important to consider. For example, this includes (preservation of) positivity properties of divisors on toric varieties under blowdowns. In the case of (restrictions of) conormal bundles, this can be interpreted in terms of interactions between local convexity data stored in rational equivalence relations. We consider generalizations to realizations of simplicial pseudomanifolds and replace rational equivalence with effects of PL homeomorphisms.
  Decomposing the PL homeomorphisms into edge subdivisions and contractions, we characterize the space of suitable contraction points compatible with local convexity properties in terms of convex unions and completions. This gives rise to certain external edge subdivisions that make this ``contraction space'' of the starting edge empty, which is unexpected given the expected ``increased convexity'' from edge subdivisions. We also obtain strong affine/linear restrictions on realizations of facets containing nearby edges preserving local convexity. This implies that contracting certain nearby edges results in a very large or very small contraction space of the starting edge. As for boundary behavior, there are parallels between effects of PL homeomorphisms on induced 4-cycles in the 1-skeleton. Finally, we find effects of PL homeomorphisms and suspensions on analogues of local convexity properties stored by linear systems of parameters. This indicates that simplicial spheres PL homeomorphic to the boundary of a cross polytope store record local convexity changes in the most natural way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that continuous epimorphisms between a class of subgroups of mapping class groups of orientable infinite-genus 2-manifolds with no planar ends are always induced by homeomorphisms. This class of subgroups includes the pure mapping class group, the closure of the compactly supported mapping classes, and the full mapping class group in the case that the underlying manifold has a finite number of ends or is perfectly self-similar. As a corollary, these groups are Hopfian topological groups.</description>

      <title>Bowditch representations in Gromov-hyperbolic spaces : characterizations, dynamics of $\mathrm{Out}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the $BQ$-conditions, introduced by Bowditch and further developed by Tan-Wong-Zhang, for representations of the free group of rank two into isometry groups of Gromov-hyperbolic spaces. We show the existence of an explicit constant $K_\delta$, depending only on the hyperbolicity constant $\delta$ of the space, such that the hyperbolicity of the images of primitive elements together with the finiteness of the set of (conjugacy classes of) primitive elements whose images have lengths bounded by $K_\delta$ imply a linear growth of the lengths with respect to the word length on primitive elements. We give several characterizations of Bowditch representations, and the framework developed allows us to prove that they form an open domain of discontinuity in the character variety. As a corollary, we also obtain a new characterization of primitive-stable representations, introduced by Minsky. Finally, we explain how our results can be used to obtain finite certificate for the recognition of Bowditch representations.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Ricci Flows and Hyperbolic Structures on a Class of Compact $3$-Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a combinatorial Ricci flow on closed pseudo $3$-manifolds $(M,\mathcal{T})$. We prove that if every edge in the triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ has valence at least $9$, then the combinatorial Ricci flow converges exponentially fast to a hyperbolic metric. As a consequence, for any compact $3$-manifold $N$ with boundary admitting an ideal triangulation $\mathcal{T}_N$ whose edges all have valence at least $9$, there exists a unique complete hyperbolic metric with totally geodesic boundary on $N$ such that $\mathcal{T}_N$ is isotopic to a geometric decomposition of $N$. This provides a partial solution to the conjecture of Costantino, Frigerio, Martelli and Petronio, and hence an affirmative answer of Thurston's geometric ideal triangulation conjecture for such manifolds. Moreover, we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds for the resulting hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>Cheeger inequalities on simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cheeger-type inequalities in which the decomposability of a graph and the spectral gap of its Laplacian mutually control each other play an important role in graph theory and network analysis, in particular in the context of expander theory. The natural problem to extend such inequalities to simplicial complexes and their higher order Eckmann Laplacians has been open for a long time. Before proving any inequality, however, one needs to identify the right Cheeger-type constant for which such an inequality can hold. Here, we solve this problem. Our solution involves and combines constructions from simplicial topology, signed graphs, Gromov filling radii and an interpolation between the standard 2-Laplacians and the analytically more difficult 1-Laplacians, for which, however, the inequalities become equalities. It is then natural to develop a general theory for $p$-Laplacians on simplicial complexes and investigate the related Cheeger-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>The Injective category number on continuous maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of injective category number $\text{IC}(f)$ for a continuous map $f\colon X\to~Y$, and present fundamental results concerning this numerical invariant. The value $\text{IC}(f)$ quantifies the \aspas{complexity} or \aspas{categorical structure} underlying the question: under what conditions is $f$ injective? More precisely, $\text{IC}(f)$ is the smallest positive integer $\ell$ such that $X$ can be covered by $\ell$ open subsets $U_1,\ldots,U_\ell$, with each restriction map $f_{\mid U}:U\to Y$ being injective. For instance, we examine the behaviour of $\text{IC}(f)$ under pullbacks and compositions of maps. In addition, we provide a cohomological lower bound for $\text{IC}(f)$. When $f$ has a finite number of multiple points, we express $\text{IC}(f)$ in terms of these points of non-injectivity. In the case that $f$ is the quotient map $\mathfrak{q}^X:X\to X/G$, where $X$ is a metric free $G$-space, we provide a lower bound for the injective category of $\mathfrak{q}^X$ in terms of the $2$-th index, $\text{ind}_2(X,G)$. When $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$, this lower bound is shown to be sharp. These results link a classical problem in Borsuk-Ulam theory to contemporary research developments in the study of injective category numbers.</description>

      <title>Strongly bounded generation in transformation groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Word metrics on finitely generated groups have canonical quasi-isometry classes, making quasi-isometry invariants genuine group invariants. Rosendal generalized this phenomenon to topological groups through CB-generation, but in the general topological setting the resulting quasi-isometry invariants are not invariants of the underlying abstract group. Specializing to the discrete case yields what we call SB-generated groups, where the invariants are genuinely algebraic. We show that SB-generation arises naturally in transformation groups by identifying several broad families of examples: the identity component of homeomorphism groups of closed manifolds, certain big mapping class groups, and homeomorphism groups of compact well-ordered spaces with successor limit capacity. These results demonstrate that SB-generation provides a robust extension of finite generation.</description>
