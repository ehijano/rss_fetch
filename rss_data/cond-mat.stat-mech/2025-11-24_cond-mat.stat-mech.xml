      <title>Zero-temperature dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically solve the zero-temperature dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal random interactions drawn from the real elliptic ensemble of random matrices, where a single parameter $\eta$ continuously interpolates between purely symmetric ($\eta=1$) and purely antisymmetric ($\eta=-1$) couplings. We show that the two-time correlation and response functions depend on both times in the presence of non-reciprocal interactions, reflecting the breakdown of time-translation invariance and the absence of equilibrium at long times. Nevertheless, the long-time relaxation of the two-time observables is governed by exponential decays, in contrast to the slow, power-law relaxation characteristic of the model with purely symmetric interactions. We further show that, when the interactions present antisymmetric correlations of strength $\eta &lt;0$, there is a time scale $\tau(\eta)$ above which the dynamics undergoes a transition to an oscillatory regime where the two-time observables display periodic oscillations with an exponentially decaying amplitude. Overall, our results give a detailed account of the dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions at zero temperature, providing a benchmark for the study of complex systems with nonlinear and asymmetric interactions.</description>

      <title>Simulated Annealing for Quadratic and Higher-Order Unconstrained Integer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a key algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, which model numerous real-world systems. While SA is commonly used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, many practical problems are more naturally formulated using integer variables. We therefore study quadratic and higher-order unconstrained integer optimization (QUIO and HUIO) problems, which generalize QUBO by allowing integer-valued variables and higher-order interactions. Conventional approaches often convert these problems into QUBO formulations through binary encoding and the reduction of higher-order terms. Such conversions, however, greatly increase the number of variables and interactions, resulting in long computation times and, for large-scale problems, even making the conversion itself a dominant computational bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient framework that directly applies SA to QUIO and HUIO problems without converting them into QUBO. Within this framework, we introduce an optimal-transition Metropolis method, designed to improve efficiency when the variable bounds are wide, and evaluate its performance alongside the conventional Metropolis and heat bath methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed direct approach achieves higher efficiency and solution quality than the conventional QUBO-based formulation and reveal the practical advantages of the optimal-transition Metropolis method. The algorithm developed in this study is available as part of the open-source library OpenJij, which provides a Python interface with a C++ backend.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the degeneracy of bound magnon crystals from magnetic and thermodynamic features of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic, thermodynamic, and magnetocaloric properties of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with three distinct exchange interactions are investigated in an external magnetic field using the variational method, extended localized-magnon approach, and exact diagonalization. Variational arguments rigorously establish two distinct fragmented phases in the frustrated regime. In the former phase all four spins of each square plaquette form a collective plaquette singlet, whereas in the latter phase two dimer singlets are formed along diagonals of each square plaquette. These bound two-magnon states, supplemented with three localized one-magnon states, enable us to elaborate a generalized localized-magnon theory that is applicable in a frustrated regime across the entire field range as confirmed by comparison with exact diagonalization data. The concept of localized magnons provides a consistent description of low-temperature magnetization curves featuring intermediate one-fifth and three-fifths plateaus, which intersect each other at temperature-independent crossing points determined by the relative degeneracies of competing bound-magnon phases. Field variations of the specific heat reveal a pronounced double-peak structure near each field-driven transition with peak heights depending on the relative degeneracies of the respective bound-magnon states. Our results demonstrate that the system supports highly efficient cooling via adiabatic demagnetization, making it a promising candidate for magnetocaloric refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Triple point in a cell fluid model with effective temperature-dependent attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a cell fluid model of a many-particle system with Curie-Weiss-type interaction potential. It is considered as an open system in a fixed volume partitioned into a large number of congruent cubic cells. The interaction potential comprises two competing components: a global uniform attraction acting between all particle pairs in the volume and a short-range repulsion between particles occupying the same cell. Previous studies have established that this model admits an exact solution, exhibits multiple critical points, and undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions. Despite variations in the interaction strengths, no triple point appears as long as these parameters remain fixed. We demonstrate that incorporating effective {temperature-dependent} attractive interactions fundamentally alters the phase behavior of the cell model. This modification preserves the model's exact solvability while resulting in the emergence of a triple point in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Multi-Party Entanglement Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of multi-party entanglement signals in chaotic quantum many-body systems including but not necessarily restricted to holographic conformal field theories. We find that scrambling dynamics generates multiparty entanglement with rich structure including: (a) qualitatively different dynamical behaviours for different signals, likely reflecting different dynamics for different kinds of entanglement patterns, (b) discontinuities indicating dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement structure, (c) transient and non-monotonic multiparty entanglement, and (d) periods during which the extensive entanglement of some regions is entirely multipartite. Our main technical tool is the membrane theory of entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic reverse annealing is robust to low-temperature decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) is an improvement to conventional quantum annealing (QA) that uses an initial guess at the desired ground state to circumvent problematic phase transitions. Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Conserved quantities enable the quantum Mpemba effect in weakly open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observation of the quantum Mpemba effect has spurred much interest in its enabling conditions and its relation to the classical counterpart. Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.</description>

      <title>EFT meets CFT: Multiloop renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in general $\boldsymbol{\phi^4}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</description>

      <title>A permutation-based power series representation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula was recently resummed exactly in one variable, and left as a power series in the other (Moodie and Long 2021 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 015208). The coefficients of the power series were provided as a sum of products of three hyperbolic functions that are analogous to the familiar commutator expansion. We find a new form of the power series coefficients that is a linear combination of just one of the hyperbolic functions. This linear combination can be understood through elementary permutations of the arguments of the hyperbolic function. We use generating functions and hyperbolic identities to relate the representations. The permutation representation is radically different to previously known structures in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and naturally supersedes the previous power series representation for future use, in our opinion. It also allows us to prove a set of intriguing marching identities that are useful in physical applications and were discovered in the initial work.</description>

      <title>Glass Viscosity Curvature from Constraint-Driven Actualization: A Physical Parity with the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation empirically describes the super-Arrhenius viscosity of glass-forming liquids; however, its divergence at a finite temperature $T_{0}$ lacks a clear physical basis. Here, a formulation derived from Dynamic Present Theory (DP$\Phi$) and its Continuous Present Actualization (CPA) framework is tested: a CPA Rate modulated by a temperature-dependent Constraint Load $C(T)$, the CPA + Constraint (CPA + C) model. This formulation was evaluated across three canonical datasets: ortho-terphenyl (OTP) measurements from Laughlin and Uhlmann (1972) and Plazek et al. (1994), and glycerol-water mixtures from Kumar et al. (1994). Across all evaluated systems, the CPA + C formulation demonstrated statistical parity with the VFT model ($R^{2} &gt; 0.99$), reproducing the viscosity curve by more than 14 orders of magnitude. Unlike the VFT equation, this approach derives the nonlinear curvature from a physically interpretable mechanism: the increase in configurational constraint as the system approaches a CPA Lock-In threshold. These findings indicate that the residual noise observed in simpler models represents an actual physical signal, which the CPA + C model effectively isolates. This suggests that the VFT's empirical success originates from its implicit capture of an underlying constraint-driven dynamic, providing a physically interpretable foundation for one of the most enduring phenomenological equations in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many physical settings, the statistical properties of quantum states are thought to be described by the Scrooge ensemble, a more structured generalization of the Haar ensemble. In this work, we prove several key results on the properties and complexity of Scrooge-random states in macroscopic quantum systems, and provide a general-purpose calculus for evaluating their moments. A key theme of our results is a separation between universal random fluctuations in non-local properties and exponential concentration of all local properties. Implications for device benchmarking, sampling advantages beyond random circuits, quantum complexity growth, and the physical origin of Scrooge-random states are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable and noise-resilient protocol for the detection of the entanglement transition in a projective version of the transverse field Ising model. Entanglement transitions are experimentally difficult to observe due to the inherent randomness of projective measurements and noise in large-scale experimental settings. Our approach combines error correction algorithms with classical shadow tomography to overcome both problems. This allows for experimentally accessible upper and lower bounds on the entanglement transition without postselection or full state tomography. These bounds remain robust under noise and their sharpness is a measure of the noise rate.</description>

      <title>Empirical universality and non-universality of local dynamics in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have aimed to design algorithms for optimizing the Hamiltonians of spin glass models from statistical physics. While Montanari (2018) eventually gave a sophisticated message-passing algorithm to do this nearly optimally for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, Parisi (2003) observed earlier that a simple yet unusual algorithm seems to perform just as well: perform local reluctant search, repeatedly making the local adjustment improving the objective function by the smallest possible amount. This is in contrast to the more intuitive local greedy search that repeatedly makes the local adjustment improving the objective by the largest possible amount. We study empirically how the performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of entries of the coupling matrix in the SK model. We find evidence that, while the runtime of greedy search enjoys universality over a broad range of distributions, the runtime of reluctant search surprisingly is not universal, sometimes depending quite sensitively on the entry distribution. We propose that one mechanism leading to this non-universality is a change in the behavior of reluctant search when the couplings have discrete support on an evenly-spaced grid, and give experimental results supporting this proposal and investigating other properties of a distribution that might affect the performance of reluctant search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Societies experience politically stable and unstable phases along history, whereas political power is usually passed to new elite groups by these changes. Structural dynamics of the elites in a society have been proposed to be one of the core drivers shaping long term behavior. As current models and data are rather macroscopic, the emergence of macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we introduce an adaptive network model of directed links representing political power and competing political ideas, based on local dynamical rules, only. The model is based on two socially motivated behaviors: the cumulative advantage effect of political power and intra-elite conflict. We observe punctuated equilibria as an emergent behavior and find a phase transition towards a disordered phase. We define an advance warning measure for elite collapse and find that the states of only a few largest nodes are suitable as a proxy with predictive information.</description>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Bound for Canonical Nonlinearity Under Single-Shot Work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We reveal that the extended nonlinearity for nonequilibrium state is bounded from upper by the information about Renyi divergences for equilibrium states in between practical and linear systems, and temperature and work.</description>

      <title>A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching, we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singularities prevalent in classical thermodynamics largely stem from the "postulate of equal a priori probabilities" neglecting the physical constraints imposed by computational complexity. This paper introduces Complexity Window Thermodynamics (CWT), a framework that characterizes the observer's "ignorance" via a finite complexity budget, thereby naturally smoothing out singular behaviors associated with phase transitions and negative temperatures within this window. We derive a generalized First Law of Thermodynamics driven by a complexity generation potential, which incorporates "information processing work," and demonstrate a universal action-time bound constraining the growth of complexity. CWT not only offers a unified perspective on critical phenomena in condensed matter and the black hole information problem but also suggests that the total generatable complexity of the universe is comparable in order of magnitude to its holographic entropy. Thus, it paves a new pathway for a resource-theoretic unification of thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.</description>

Abstract: Using the mean-field approximation, a formula for the effective electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional system of randomly arranged conducting sticks with a given orientation distribution was obtained. Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement. Our study showed that cross-alignment of nanowires should lead to a decreasing in the electrical conductivity compared to electrodes with isotropically arranged nanowires. We suppose that the widely used model with zero-width sticks is quite acceptable for systems of cross-aligned nanowires, but overestimates their connectivity in isotropic systems. Thus, the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of conducting films with cross-aligned nanowires may be due to a significant difference in the network topology.</description>

      <title>The critical O(N) CFT: Methods and conformal data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical $O(N)$ CFT in spacetime dimensions $2 &lt; d &lt; 4$ is one of the most important examples of a conformal field theory, with the Ising CFT at $N=1$, $2 \leq d &lt; 4$, as a notable special case. Apart from numerous physical applications, it serves frequently as a concrete testing ground for new approaches and techniques based on conformal symmetry. In the perturbative limits - the $4-\varepsilon$ expansion, the large $N$ expansion and the $2+\tilde\epsilon$ expansion - a lot of conformal data have been computed over the years. In this report, we give an overview of the critical $O(N)$ CFT, including some methods to study it, and present a large collection of conformal data. The data, extracted from the literature and supplemented by many additional computations of order $\varepsilon$ anomalous dimensions, are made available through an ancillary data file.</description>

      <title>Estimating Global Input Relevance and Enforcing Sparse Representations with a Scalable Spectral Neural Network Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features. Isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. Moreover, by leveraging on the regularization of the eigenvalues, it is possible to enforce solutions making use of a minimum subset of the input components, increasing the explainability of the model and providing sparse input representations. The technique is compared to the most common methods in the literature and is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</description>

Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha&gt;D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\'y and Preiss.</description>

      <title>Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers' transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile, recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume that the carrier's hopping amplitude is modulated by a single undamped vibration. The modulation is, however, by many low-frequency modes, whose net effect can be approximated using a few effective damped oscillators. Here, we employ the dissipaton equations of motion (DEOM) method to compute the finite-temperature real-time current autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of the assumed delta-like phonon spectrum and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in describing experimental data.</description>

      <title>How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective</title>

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</description>

      <title>On the supra-linear storage in dense networks of grid and place cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -- yet preserving the same resolution -- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -- analytically -- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -- numerically -- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.</description>
