      <title>Shaped free electron vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their first theoretical proposal [Ngoko Djiokap et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 113004 (2015)] and experimental demonstration [Pengel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 053003 (2017)], free electron vortices (FEVs) have attracted considerable attention. Recently, a new class of unusually shaped FEVs, termed `reversible electron spirals', has been proposed theoretically [Strandquist et al., Phys. Rev. A 106, 043110 (2022)] for atomic single-photon ionization by two oppositely chirped and counterrotating circularly polarized (CRCP) attosecond pulses. Building on this concept, we present the first experimental demonstration of shaped FEVs created by atomic multiphoton ionization (MPI) using oppositely chirped CRCP femtosecond pulse pairs. In MPI by polarization-shaped pulses, several shaped FEVs of different rotational symmetry are superimposed resulting in the total photoelectron wave packet observed in the experiment. We employ velocity map imaging techniques to measure the photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) and reconstruct the three-dimensional PMD by photoelectron tomography. Fourier analysis is used to decompose the measured PMD into the contributing FEVs with different rotational symmetries. The experimental results are supported by an analytical model and reproduced by numerical simulations, which provide insight into the role of resonant intermediate states. Our approach allows us to retrieve spectral information from the shaped laser field and the signatures of the MPI dynamics inscribed within the shaped FEVs.</description>

      <title>Phase projection errors in rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase between the oscillating (rf) excitation field and the detected (light) power modulation in scalar rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), in particular in the $M_x$ configuration. While the static dependence of the demodulation phase on the direction of the external static magnetic field vector can be largely overcome by aligning the oscillating rf field along the light propagation direction, we show that a dynamic (transient) phase response can appear under tilts of the magnetic field. We analytically solve the corresponding modified Bloch equation and obtain agreement with experimental observations in an $M_x$ magnetometer setup using a paraffin-coated Cs vapor cell. The results reveal fundamental limitations of $M_x$ magnetometers in terms of response time and accuracy, in particular when operated with active electronic feedback, e.g., using a phase-locked loop. Thus, the work is highly relevant in important magnetometry applications, where the direction of the quasi-static magnetic field of interest is not known \textit{a priori} and/or not constant over time, or in measurements, in which a large detection bandwidth is paramount. Such conditions are encountered, e.g., in geomagnetic surveying, in particular with mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of an Optical Polarization State in a Polarization-Selective Nonlinear Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit polarization self-rotation in atomic rubidium vapor to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking and bistability of polarization patterns. We pump the vapor cell with horizontally polarized light while the vertical polarization, which is initially in the vacuum state, is resonated in a ring cavity. Vacuum fluctuations in this mode experience cumulative gain due to the compound action of amplification due to the self-rotation and feedback through the resonator, eventually acquiring a macroscopic magnitude akin to an optical parametric oscillator. The randomness of these fluctuations results in a bistable, random macroscopic polarization pattern at the output. We propose utilizing this mechanism to simulate Ising-like interaction between multiple spatial modes and as a basis for a fully optical coherent Ising machine.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ feedback prevails at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the first galaxies, stars, and star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation pressure from Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) scattering is a potentially dominant form of early stellar feedback, capable of injecting up to $\sim 100 \, \times$ more momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) than UV continuum radiation pressure and stellar winds. Ly$\alpha$ feedback is particularly strong in dust-poor environments and is thus especially important during the formation of the first stars and galaxies. As upcoming galaxy formation simulations incorporate Ly$\alpha$ feedback, it is crucial to consider processes that can limit it to avoid placing $\Lambda$CDM in apparent tension with recent \textit{JWST} observations indicating efficient star formation at Cosmic Dawn. We study Ly$\alpha$ feedback using a novel analytical Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer solution that includes the effects of continuum absorption, gas velocity gradients, Ly$\alpha$ destruction (e.g. by $2p \rightarrow 2s$ transitions), ISM turbulence, and atomic recoil. We verify our solution for uniform clouds using extensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) tests, and resolve a previous discrepancy between analytical and MCRT predictions. We then study the sensitivity of Ly$\alpha$ feedback to the aforementioned effects. While these can dampen Ly$\alpha$ feedback by a factor $\lesssim \textrm{few} \times 10$, we find it remains $\gtrsim 5 - 100 \, \times$ stronger than direct radiation pressure and therefore cannot be neglected. We provide an accurate fit for the Ly$\alpha$ force multiplier $M_{\rm F}$, suitable for implementation in subgrid models for galaxy formation simulations. Our findings highlight the critical role of Ly$\alpha$ feedback in regulating star formation at Cosmic Dawn, and underscore the necessity of incorporating it into simulations to accurately model early galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Achieving 5 % $^{13}$C nuclear spin hyperpolarization in high-purity diamond at room temperature and low field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically polarizable nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond enables the hyperpolarization of $^{13}$C nuclear spins at low magnetic field and room temperature. However, achieving a high level of polarization comparable to conventional dynamic nuclear polarization has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate that, at below 10 mT, a $^{13}$C polarization of 5 % can be obtained, equivalent to an enhancement ratio over $7 \times 10^6$. We used high-purity diamond with a low initial nitrogen concentration ($&lt;$ 1 ppm), which also results in a long storage time exceeding 100 minutes. By aligning the magnetic field along [100], the number of NV spins participating in polarization transfer increases fourfold. We conducted a comprehensive optimization of field intensity and microwave (MW) frequency-sweep parameters for this field orientation. The optimum MW sweep width suggests that polarization transfer occurs primarily to bulk $^{13}$C spins through the integrated solid effect followed by nuclear spin diffusion.</description>

      <title>Helicity-selected near-circularly polarized attosecond pulses generated from mixed He-Ne gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and theoretically demonstrate a method for generating helicity-selected near-circularly polarized attosecond pulses in mixed He-Ne gases using bichromatic counter-rotating circularly polarized (BCCP) fields. High-order harmonics driven by BCCP fields exhibit circular polarization for individual orders in the frequency domain, but adjacent orders have opposite helicities. By utilizing the He-Ne mixture, we select only one helical component of the harmonics, resulting in the generation of highly elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in the time domain. Our analyses based on the quantum-orbit theory and the strong field approximation further clarify that the polarization of attosecond pulses is governed by the interference mechanism of high-order harmonics emitted by He and Ne. This combination of BCCP fields and an atomic mixture which requires no alignment in experiments, significantly simplifies the generation of elliptically polarized harmonics dominated by one helical component, thereby paving the way for an efficient and robust method to generate bright attosecond pulses with large ellipticity.</description>

      <title>Pancharatnam phase as an entanglement witness for quantum gravity in dual Stern-Gerlach interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in fundamental tests and practical applications of quantum mechanics. Because entanglement is a feature unique to quantum systems, its observation provides evidence of the quantum nature on the system. Hence, if gravity can generate entanglement between quantum superpositions, this indicates that quantum amplitudes are field sources and gravity is a quantum phenomenon. I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers proposed to test the quantum nature of gravity and show that the Pancharatnam phase displays features that provide a qualitative distinction between semiclassical and quantum signatures of gravity. The semiclassical evolution of the system is equivalent to that of a single interferometer (a two-level system) in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution of the superposition in the Bloch sphere. In contrast, in the quantum case, the two interferometers are coupled (two two-level systems) and I find that the phase is continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the single-quantum positron annihilation with a bound electron in the near threshold region. The angular distribution and the total cross section are considered. We obtain a simple analytical expression for the Coulomb potential and for the screened potential. It is worth noting that the obtained results for the screened potential are universal and independent of the explicit form of the atomic potential. It is shown that screening significantly increases the cross section. We also obtain the analogous results for bound-free $e^+e^-$ photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we develop a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase-shift profiles of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. The sample axial positions are resolved with micrometer resolution, and their spectroscopy are extracted from complex-valued images recorded at various probe frequencies. The phase-angle readout is not only robust against transition saturation, but also insensitive to atom-number and optical-pumping-induced interaction-strength fluctuations. Benefiting from such features, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot resolution to the transition frequency of a $^{87}$Rb D2 line, with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate single-shot 3D field sensing by measuring local light shifts to the atomic array with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>A geometric effect of quantum particles originated from the classicality of their flow velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we propose a new quantum effect that naturally emerges from describing the quantum particle as a classical fluid. Following the hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics for a particle in a finite convex region, we show how the maximum values of the wavefunction's amplitude lie along the boundaries of the region when imposing a vanished quantum potential, implying\ a classical flow velocity of the particle. The effect is obtained for the case of particles in curved space, described by Riemannian structures. We further show that such an effect\ cannot be achieved in the relativistic regime when dealing with quantum particles in flat or curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Beam assisted High-Order Harmonic Generation in Semiconductor Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the context of high harmonic generation (HHG) within semiconductor crystals. Our contribution deals with the transfer and conservation of OAM in the strong-field regime, from the driving laser field to the generated harmonics. To this end, in this work, we combine the semiconductor Bloch equations with the thin slab model to simulate the generation of high-order harmonics in semiconductor media and to compute the features of the far-field harmonics. We demonstrate that this theoretical approach is capable of satisfactorily reproducing previously published experimental features of the generated harmonics in ZnO driven by a Laguerre-Gauss beam. Our research not only deepens the understanding of light-solid interactions but also heralds the dawn of bright, structured XUV coherent radiation sources with unparalleled potential across diverse technological areas, paving the way for enhanced functionalities in fields such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and optical communication.</description>
