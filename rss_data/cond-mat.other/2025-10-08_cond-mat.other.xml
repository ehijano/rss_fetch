      <title>Spin Symmetry Criteria for Odd-parity Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit even-parity nonrelativistic spin splitting, odd-parity magnets (OPMs) have been proposed and emerged as a novel research frontier. In this study, we perform a comprehensive spin group symmetry analysis to establish symmetry criteria for the emergence of OPMs. We identify eight distinct symmetry-driven cases that support OPMs, enabling their realization in collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic orders. These OPMs are categorized into three types based on their spin textures for Bloch states: collinear (type-I), coplanar (type-II), and noncoplanar (type-III). For type-I OPMs, we further delineate additional symmetry requirements for $p$-wave and $f$-wave spin splitting. We identify 48 candidate materials in the Magndata database that satisfy these symmetry criteria. Additionally, we construct two theoretical models to validate the effectiveness of the established symmetry criteria. Finally, we show that OPMs can exhibit an intrinsic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and construct a theoretical model to realize this phase.</description>

      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter.</description>

      <title>SHarmonic: A fast and accurate implementation of spherical harmonics for electronic-structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The authors present SHarmonic, a new implementation of the spherical harmonics targeted for electronic-structure calculations. Their approach is to use explicit formulas for the harmonics written in terms of normalized Cartesian coordinates. This approach results in a code that is as precise as other implementations while being at least one order of magnitude more computationally efficient. The library can run on graphics processing units (GPUs) as well, achieving an additional order of magnitude in execution speed. This new implementation is simple to use and is provided under an open source license, it can be readily used by other codes to avoid the error-prone and cumbersome implementation of the spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Magnon Interaction Induced by Dynamic Coupling in a Hybrid Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a combined experimental and numerical investigation of spin-wave dynamics in a hybrid magnonic crystal consisting of a CoFeB artificial spin ice (ASI) of stadium-shaped nanoelements patterned atop a continuous NiFe film, separated by a 5 nm Al2O3 spacer. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we probe the frequency dependence of thermal spin waves as functions of applied magnetic field and wavevector, revealing the decisive role of interlayer dipolar coupling in the magnetization dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations complement the experiments, showing a strong interplay between ASI edge modes and backward volume modes in the NiFe film. The contrast in saturation magnetization between CoFeB and NiFe enhances this coupling, leading to a pronounced hybridization manifested as a triplet of peaks in the spectra - predicted by simulations and observed experimentally. This magnon-magnon coupling persists over a wide magnetic field range, shaping both the spin-wave dispersion and frequency-field response throughout the hysteresis loop. Our findings establish how ASI geometry can selectively enhance specific spin-wave wavelengths in the underlying film, identifying them as preferential channels for magnonic signal transport and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Decoupling thermoelectric coefficients of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Coupling induced emergent topology in a two-leg fermionic ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. Though depending on the dimerization pattern, the dimerized leg can be either topological or trivial in nature, here we show that by connecting such a leg to a uniform leg through inter-chain coupling, the overall system becomes topological irrespective of the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.</description>
