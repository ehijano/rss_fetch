      <title>The Non-Orientable 4-Genus of 11 Crossing Non-Alternating Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-orientable 4-genus of a knot K in the three sphere is defined to be the minimum first Betti number of a non-orientable surface F in the four-ball so that K bounds F. We will survey the tools used to compute the non-orientable 4-genus, and use various techniques to calculate this invariant for non-alternating 11 crossing knots. We also will view obstructions to a knot bounding a M\"obius band given by the double branched cover of the three sphere branched over K.</description>

      <title>Complex Hyperbolic Geometry of Chain Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex hyperbolic triangle group $\Gamma=\Delta_{4,\infty,\infty;\infty}$ acting on the complex hyperbolic plane ${\bf H}^2_{\mathbb C}$ is generated by complex reflections $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ such that the product $I_2I_3$ has order four, the products $I_3I_1$, $I_1I_2$ are parabolic and the product $I_1I_3I_2I_3$ is an accidental parabolic element. Unexpectedly, the product $I_1I_2I_3I_2$ is a hidden accidental parabolic element. We show that the 3-manifold at infinity of $\Delta_{4,\infty,\infty;\infty}$ is the complement of the chain link $8^4_1$ in the 3-sphere. In particular, the quartic cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold $S^3-8^4_1$ admits a spherical CR-uniformization. The proof relies on a new technique to show that the ideal boundary of the Ford domain is an infinite-genus handlebody. Motivated by this result and supported by the previous studies of various authors, we conjecture that the chain link $C_p$ is an ancestor of the 3-manifold at infinity of the critical complex hyperbolic triangle group $\Delta_{p,q,r;\infty}$, for $3 \leq p \leq 9$.</description>

      <title>Reversibility in the Seifert-fibered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An element $a$ in a group $\Gamma$ is called \emph{reversible} if there exists $g \in \Gamma$ such that $gag^{-1}=a^{-1}$. The reversible elements are also known as `real elements' or `reciprocal elements' in literature. In this paper, we classify the reversible elements in Fuchsian groups, and use this classification to find all reversible elements in a Seifert-fibered group. In the last section we apply this classification to the braid groups, particularly to the braid group on $3$ strands.</description>

      <title>Diameter of a new model of random hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of random surfaces, especially in the asymptotics of large genus, has been of increasing interest in recent years. Many geometrical questions have analogous formulations in the theory of random graphs with a large number of vertices, and results obtained in one area can inspire the other. In this paper, we are interested in the diameter of random surfaces, a basic measure of the connectivity of the surface. We introduce a new class of models of random surfaces built from random graphs and we compute the asymptotic of the diameter of these surfaces, which is logarithmic in the genus of the surface. The strategy of the proof relies on a detailed study of an exploration process which is the analogue of the breadth-first search exploration of a random graph. Its analysis is based on subadditive and concentration techniques.</description>

      <title>Reeb graph invariants of Morse functions and $3$-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we are focused on the existence of Morse functions on a closed manifold $M$ which are far from being ordered, i.e. whose Reeb graphs have positive first Betti number, especially the maximal possible, equals $\operatorname{corank}(\pi_1(M))$. In the case of $3$-manifolds we describe the minimal number of critical points needed to construct such functions, which is related with the number of vertices of degree $2$ in Reeb graphs. We define a new invariant of $3$-manifold groups and their presentations, and using Heegaard splittings we show its utility in determining occurrence of disordered Morse functions. In particular, the Freiheitssatz, a result for one-relator groups, allows us to calculate this invariant in the case of orientable circle-bundles over a surface, which provides an interesting example of the behaviour of Morse functions.</description>

      <title>Nested cobordisms, Cyl-objects and Temperley-Lieb algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete cobordism category for nested manifolds and nested cobordisms between them. A variation of stratified Morse theory applies in this case, and yields generators for a general nested cobordism category. Restricting to a low-dimensional example of the ``striped cylinder'' cobordism category Cyl, we give a complete set of relations for the generators. With an eye towards the study of TQFTs defined on a nested cobordism category, we describe functors Cyl$\to\mathcal{C}$, which we call Cyl-objects in $\mathcal{C}$, and show that they are related to known algebraic structures such as Temperley-Lieb algebras and cyclic objects. We moreover define novel algebraic constructions inspired by the structure of Cyl-objects, namely a doubling construction on cyclic objects analogous to edgewise subdivision, and a cylindrical bar construction on self-dual objects in a monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Parabolic subgroups of complex braid groups: the remaining case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Marin and Gonz\'alez-Meneses introduced a class of ``parabolic'' subgroups for generalized braid groups associated to arbitrary complex reflection groups. Using notably Garside group structures on these generalized braid groups, they proved general results on parabolic subgroups for all cases but one. This last case is that of the complex braid group B(G31), which has no Garside group structure known so far, but instead a Garside groupoid structure. Using this Garside groupoid structure, we complete the results of Marin and Gonz\'alez-Meneses by proving their main theorems for the parabolic subgroups of the complex braid group B(G31).</description>

      <description>arXiv:1811.08031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, up to homeomorphism, any graph subject to natural necessary conditions on orientation and the cycle rank can be realized as the Reeb graph of a Morse function on a given closed manifold $M$. Along the way, we show that the Reeb number $\mathcal{R}(M)$, i.e. the maximum cycle rank among all Reeb graphs of functions on $M$, is equal to the corank of fundamental group $\pi_1(M)$, thus extending a previous result of Gelbukh to the non-orientable case.</description>

      <title>Relations between Reeb graphs, systems of hypersurfaces and epimorphisms onto free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.02388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a correspondence between epimorphisms $\varphi \colon \pi_1(M) \to F_r$ from the fundamental group of a compact manifold $M$ onto the free group of rank $r$, and systems of $r$ framed non-separating hypersurfaces in $M$, which induces a bijection onto framed cobordism classes of such systems. In consequence, for closed manifolds any such $\varphi$ can be represented by the Reeb epimorphism of a Morse function $f\colon M \to \mathbb{R}$, i.e. by the epimorphism induced by the quotient map $M \to \mathcal{R}(f)$ onto the Reeb graph of $f$. Applying this construction we discuss the problem of classification up to (strong) equivalence of epimorphisms onto free groups, providing a new purely geometrical-topological proof of the solution of this problem for surface groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.13896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a compact family of totally elliptic representations of the fundamental group of a punctured sphere into $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb R)$ discovered by Deroin and Tholozan and named after them. We describe a polygonal model that parametrizes the relative character variety of Deroin--Tholozan representations in terms of chains of triangles in the hyperbolic plane. We extract action-angle coordinates from our polygonal model as geometric quantities associated to chains of triangles. The coordinates give an explicit isomorphism between the space of representations and the complex projective space. We prove that they are almost global Darboux coordinates for the Goldman symplectic form.</description>

Abstract: We clarify steps for determining the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of any arborescent knot.
  Interestingly, we show that the `excellent parts' of arborescent knots $K_1,K_2$ are isomorphic if $K_1$ can be related to $K_2$ through certain moves on projection diagrams.
  Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition in terms of diagram for the existence of components of dimension larger than $1$. A generalization to arborescent links is sketched.</description>

      <title>Thurston norms, $L^2$-norms, geodesic laminations, and Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds $M$ with volume less than a constant $V$, we prove an inequality regarding the geometric $L^2$-norm and the topological Thurston norm, which is qualitatively sharp and verifies a conjecture of Brock and Dunfield in this case. Generically, we show that the $L^2$-norm is less than a constant $c(V)$ times the Thurston norm by showing that any least area closed surface is disjoint from the thin part.
  We then study the connection between the Thurston norm, best Lipschitz circle-valued maps, and maximal stretch laminations, building on the recent work of Daskalopoulos and Uhlenbeck, and Farre, Landesberg and Minsky. We show that the distance between a level set and its translation is the reciprocal of the Lipschitz constant, bounded by the topological entropy of the pseudo-Anosov monodromy if $M$ fibers. For infinitely many examples constructed by Rudd, we show the entropy is bounded from below by one-third the length of the circumference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a supercategorification of the $q$-Schur algebra of level two and an odd analogue of $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. Using these constructions, we define a homological invariant of tangles, and show that it coincides with odd Khovanov homology when restricted to links. This gives a representation theoretic construction of odd Khovanov homology. In the process, we define a tensor product on the category of chain complexes in super-2-categories which is compatible with homotopies. This could be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We consider toric resolutions of some strongly mixed weighted homogeneous polynomials of type $J_{10}^-$. We show that the strongly mixed weighted homogeneous polynomial $f := f_{2,2,1,2,1,4}\ (k=3)$ (see \S 3) has no mixed critical points on ${\mathbb{C}^*}^2$ (Lemma 14), and moreover, show that the strict transform $\tilde V$ of the mixed hypersurface singularity $V := f^{-1}(0)$ via the toric modification $\hat{\pi} : X \to \mathbb{C}^2$, where we set $f := f_{2,2,1,2,1,4}\ (k=3)$, is not only a real analytic manifold outside of ${\tilde V} \cap \hat{\pi}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{0})$ but also a real analytic manifold as a germ of ${\tilde V} \cap \hat{\pi}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{0})$ (Theorem 15).</description>
