      <title>The Connection Between Monetary Policy and Housing Prices: Public Perception and Expert Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the general public perceives the link between monetary policy and housing markets. Using a large-scale, cross-country survey experiment in Austria, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, we examine households' understanding of monetary policy, their beliefs about its impact on house prices, and how these beliefs respond to expert information. We find that while most respondents grasp the basic mechanisms of conventional monetary policy and recognize the connection between interest rates and house prices, literacy regarding unconventional monetary policy is very low. Beliefs about the monetary policy-housing nexus are malleable and respond to information, particularly when it is provided by academic economists rather than central bankers. Monetary policy literacy is strongly related to education, gender, age, and experience in housing and mortgage markets. Our results highlight the central role of housing in how households interpret monetary policy and point to the importance of credible and inclusive communication strategies for effective policy transmission.</description>

      <title>Targeting Information in Ad Auction Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital advertising platforms and publishers sell ad inventory that conveys targeting information, such as demographic, contextual, or behavioral audience segments, to advertisers. While revealing this information improves ad relevance, it can reduce competition and lower auction revenues. To resolve this trade-off, this paper develops a general auction mechanism -- the Information-Bundling Position Auction (IBPA) mechanism -- that leverages the targeting information to maximize publisher revenue across both search and display advertising environments. The proposed mechanism treats the ad inventory type as the publisher's private information and allocates impressions by comparing advertisers' marginal revenues.
  We show that IBPA resolves the trade-off between targeting precision and market thickness: publisher revenue is increasing in information granularity and decreasing in disclosure granularity. Moreover, IBPA dominates the generalized second-price (GSP) auction for any distribution of advertiser valuations and under any information or disclosure regime. We also characterize computationally efficient approximations that preserve these guarantees.
  Using auction-level data from a large retail media platform, we estimate advertiser valuation distributions and simulate counterfactual outcomes. Relative to GSP, IBPA increases publisher revenue by 68%, allocation rate by 19pp, advertiser welfare by 29%, and total welfare by 54%.</description>

      <title>Institutions, Education, and Religious Change: Evidence from Colombia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do religious identities change? We study the effects of civic education reforms on religious identification using Colombia's 1991 Constitution, which dismantled the country's confessional regime and mandated constitutional instruction in high schools. Exploiting cohort-based variation in exposure to the reform and nationally representative survey data, we implement a difference-in-differences design. We find that exposure to the constitutional curriculum reduced Catholic self-identification by about three percentage points. This decline reflects a reallocation of religious identities rather than a generalized decline in religiosity. In regions where Catholic institutional presence was historically weaker, Catholic losses translate into switching toward non-Catholic Christian denominations and higher religious attendance. In contrast, in regions where Catholic dominance was stronger, the decline is associated with increased secular identification and lower attendance. These patterns hold across ethnic and non-ethnic groups and are shaped primarily by regional religious supply rather than ethnicity per se. Overall, the results show that civic education can reconfigure religious identities by reshaping the relative legitimacy of competing affiliations.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Bi-Encoder Models for Multi-Label Skill Extraction: Enhancing ESCO Ontology Matching with BERT and Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained labor market analysis increasingly relies on mapping unstructured job advertisements to standardized skill taxonomies such as ESCO. This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic match classification model for sports tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing match classification models in the tournament design literature have two major limitations: a contestant is considered indifferent only if uncertain future results do never affect its prize, and competitive matches are not distinguished with respect to the incentives of the contestants. We propose a probabilistic framework to address both issues. For each match, our approach relies on simulating all other matches played simultaneously or later to compute the qualifying probabilities under the three main outcomes (win, draw, loss), which allows the classification of each match into six different categories. The suggested model is applied to the previous group stage and the new incomplete round-robin league, introduced in the 2024/25 season of UEFA club competitions. An incomplete round-robin tournament is found to contain fewer stakeless matches where both contestants are indifferent, and substantially more matches where both contestants should play offensively. However, the robustly higher proportion of potentially collusive matches can threaten with serious scandals.</description>

      <title>Estimating Export-productivity Cutoff Contours with Profit Data: A Novel Threshold Estimation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel method to estimate firm-specific market-entry thresholds in international economics, allowing fixed costs to vary across firms alongside productivity. Our framework models market entry as an interaction between productivity and observable fixed-cost measures, extending traditional single-threshold models to ones with set-valued thresholds. Applying this approach to Chinese firm data, we estimate export-market entry thresholds as functions of domestic sales and surrogate variables for fixed costs. The results reveal substantial heterogeneity and threshold contours, challenging conventional single-threshold-point assumptions. These findings offer new insights into firm behavior and provide a foundation for further theoretical and empirical advancements in trade research.</description>

      <title>Mass Shootings, Community Mobility, and the Relocation of Economic Activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using foot traffic data for over 150,000 points of interest (POIs) near the sites of 42 mass shootings (2018-2022, U.S.), we evaluate the spatial-temporal impact of the tragic events on community mobility and relocation of economic activities. Visits to nearby POIs decrease, while farther away POIs experience increased foot traffic, implying that communities shift their activities away from the shooting sites. The impact is stronger when stronger trauma responses are expected. Our results suggest that mass shootings drive significant displacements of economic activities and can lead to welfare losses due to distortions in optimal choices of time and location.</description>

      <title>Racial bias, colorism, and overcorrection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines whether increased awareness can affect racial bias and colorism. We exploit a natural experiment arising from the widespread publicity of Price and Wolfers (2010), which served as an external shock, intensifying scrutiny of racial bias in men's basketball officiating. We investigate refereeing decisions in a similar setting, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), which is known as a progressive institution with a longstanding commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policy. We apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to systematically predict race and objectively measure skin tone. Our empirical strategy exploits the quasi-random assignment of referees to games, combined with high-dimensional fixed effects, to estimate the relationship between the racial and skin tone compositions of referees and players, as well as foul-calling behavior. Our results show no significant racial bias before the intense media coverage. However, afterward, we find evidence of overcorrection: a player earns fewer fouls when facing more referees from the opposite race and skin tone. Even though this overcorrection seems to wear off over time, we highlight the need to consider baseline levels of bias before applying any prescription with direct relevance to policymakers and organizations, given the recent discourse on DEI.</description>

      <title>When Indemnity Insurance Fails: Parametric Coverage under Binding Budget and Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-risk environments, traditional indemnity insurance is often unaffordable or ineffective, despite its well-known optimality under expected utility. We compare excess-of-loss indemnity insurance with parametric insurance within a common mean-variance framework, allowing for fixed costs, heterogeneous premium loadings, and binding budget constraints. We show that, once these realistic frictions are introduced, parametric insurance can yield higher welfare for risk-averse individuals, even under the same utility objective and without relying on behavioral assumptions. The welfare advantage arises precisely when indemnity insurance becomes impractical, and disappears once both contracts are unconstrained. Our results help reconcile classical insurance theory with the growing use of parametric risk transfer in high-risk settings.</description>

      <title>Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying peer effects in language is critical because they often reflect behavioral and personality traits that are important determinants of economic outcomes. However, language is unstructured, non-numeric, and high-dimensional. We combine Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings with structural econometric identification to provide a unified framework for identifying peer effects in language. This unified framework is applied to 80,000-120,000 written exchanges among residents of low security correctional facilities. The LLM language profiles predict three-year recidivism 30\% more accurately than pre-entry covariates alone, showing that text representations capture meaningful signals. We analyze peer effects on multidimensional language embeddings while addressing network endogeneity. We develop novel instrumental variable estimators for peer effects that accommodate multivariate outcomes, sparse networks, and multidimensional latent variables. Our methods achieve root-N consistency and asymptotic normality under realistic sparsity conditions, relaxing the dense-network assumption. Results reveal significant peer effects in residents' language profiles.</description>
