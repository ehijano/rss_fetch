      <title>Local permutation polynomials and their companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gutierrez and Urroz (2023) have proposed a family of local permutation polynomials over finite fields of arbitrary characteristic based on a class of symmetric subgroups without fixed points called $e$-Klenian groups. The polynomials within this family are referred to as $e$-Klenian polynomials. Furthermore, they have shown the existence of companions for the $e$-Klenian polynomials when the characteristic of the finite field is odd. Here, we present three new families of local permutation polynomials over finite fields of even characteristic. We also consider the problem of the existence of companions for the $e$-Klenian polynomials over finite fields of even characteristic. More precisely, we prove that over finite fields of even characteristic, the $0$-Klenian polynomials do not have any companions. However, for $e \geq 1$, we explicitly provide a companion for the $e$-Klenian polynomials. Moreover, we provide a companion for each of the new families of local permutation polynomials that we introduce.</description>

      <title>Tamagawa Numbers of Elliptic Curves with an $\ell$-isogeny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be an odd prime, and suppose $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$. If $E$ has an $\ell$-torsion point, then there has been significant work done on characterizing the $\ell$-divisibility of the global Tamagawa number of $E$. In this paper, we consider elliptic curves that are $\ell$-isogenous to elliptic curves with an $\ell$-torsion point and study the $\ell$-divisibility of their global Tamagawa numbers.</description>

      <title>The Comma Sequence is Finite in Other Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comma sequence (1, 12, 35, 94, \dots) is the lexicographically earliest sequence such that the difference of consecutive terms equals the concatenation of the digits on either side of the comma separating them. The behavior of a ``generalized comma sequence'' depends on the base the numbers are written in, as well as the sequence's initial values. We provide a computational proof that all comma sequences in bases 3 through 19, as well as 22 and 23, are finite. Relying on a combinatorial conjecture, Angelini et al.~estimated that the final element of a comma sequence in base $b$ should be roughly $\exp(O(b))$. We prove their conjecture, but provide evidence that the correct estimate is actually $\exp(O(b \log b))$.</description>

      <title>Algebraicity of Spin $L$-functions for $\mathrm{GSp}_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove algebraicity of critical values of certain Spin $L$-functions. More precisely, our results concern $L(s, \pi \otimes \chi, \mathrm{Spin})$ for cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ associated to a holomorphic Siegel eigenform on $\mathrm{GSp}_6$, Dirichlet characters $\chi$, and critical points $s$ to the right of the center of symmetry. We use the strategy of relating the $L$-values to properties of Eisenstein series, and a significant portion of the paper concerns the Fourier coefficients of these Eisenstein series. Unlike in prior algebraicity results following this strategy, our Eisenstein series are on a group $G$ that has no known moduli problem, and the $L$-functions are related to the Eisenstein series through a non-unique model.</description>

      <title>Mordell--Weil groups over large algebraic extensions of fields of characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of the Mordell--Weil groups of semiabelian varieties over large algebraic extensions of a finitely generated field of characteristic zero. We consider two types of algebraic extensions in this paper; one is of extensions obtained by adjoining the coordinates of certain points of various semiabelian varieties; the other is of extensions obtained as the fixed subfield in an algebraically closed field by a finite number of automorphisms. Some of such fields turn out to be new examples of Kummer-faithful fields which are not sub-$p$-adic. Among them, we find both examples of Kummer-faithful fields over which the Mordell--Weil group modulo torsion can be free of infinite rank and not free.</description>

      <title>Optimal sums of three cubes in $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the circle method to prove that a density 1 of elements in $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ are representable as a sum of three cubes of essentially minimal degree from $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$, assuming the Ratios Conjecture and that the characteristic is bigger than 3. Roughly speaking, to do so, we upgrade an order of magnitude result to a full asymptotic formula that was conjectured by Hooley in the number field setting.</description>

      <title>Class numbers and integer points on some Pellian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an estimate for the number of nontrivial integer points on the Pellian surface $t^2 - du^2 = 1$ in a bounded region. We give a lower bound on the size of fundamental solutions for almost all $d$ in a certain class, based on a recent conjecture of Browning and Wilsch about integer points on log K3 surfaces. We also obtain an upper bound on the average of class number in this class, assuming the same conjecture.</description>

      <title>Poisson Approximation of prime divisors of shifted primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analog for shifted primes of the Kubilius model of prime factors of integers. We prove a total variation distance estimate for the difference between the model and actual prime factors of shifted primes, and apply it to show that the prime factors of shifted primes in disjoint sets behave like independent Poisson variables. As a consequence, we establish a transference principle between the anatomy of random integers up to x and of random shifted primes p+a with p &lt; x.</description>

      <title>On the Non p-Rationality and Iwasawa Invariants of Certain Real Quadratic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and $m,r \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ with $m$ coprime to $p$. In this paper we investigate the real quadratic fields $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m^2p^{2r} + 1})$. We first show that for $m &lt; C$, where constant $C$ depends on $p$, the fundamental unit $\varepsilon$ of $K$ satisfies the congruence $\varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod{p^2}$, which implies that $K$ is a non $p$-rational field. Varying $r$ then gives an infinite family of non $p$-rational fields. When $m = 1$ and $p$ is a non-Wieferich prime, we use a criterion of Fukuda and Komatsu to show that if $p$ does not divide the class number of $K$, then the Iwasawa invariants for cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$ vanish. We conjecture that there are infinitely many $r$ such that $p$ does not divide the class number of $K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L(s,\pi)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{\pi}(n)n^{-s}$ be an $L$-function that satisfies a weak form of the generalized Ramanujan conjecture. We prove that large partial sums of $\lambda_{\pi}(n)$ strongly repel the low-lying zeros of $L(s,\pi)$ away from the critical line. Our results extend and quantitatively improve preceding work of Granville and Soundararajan.</description>

      <title>Measures supported on partly normal numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A real number $x$ is normal with respect to an integer base $b \geq 2$ if its digit expansion in this base is ``equitable'', in the sense that for $k \geq 1$, every ordered sequence of $k$ digits from $\{0, 1, \ldots, b-1\}$ occurs in the digit expansion of $x$ with the same limiting frequency. Borel's classical result \cite{b09} asserts that Lebesgue-almost every number $x$ is normal in every base $b \geq 2$. This three-part article considers sets of partial normality. Given any choice of integer bases $\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}' \subseteq \{2, 3, \ldots\}$, we investigate measure-theoretic properties of the set $\mathscr{N}(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$, whose members are, by definition, normal in the bases of $\mathscr{B}$ and non-normal in the bases of $\mathscr{B}'$. A pair of sets $(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ is compatible if any $(b, b') \in \mathscr{B} \times \mathscr{B}'$ is multiplicatively independent. For compatible $(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ with $\mathscr{B}' \ne \emptyset$, we construct singular probability measures supported on $\mathscr N(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ that are both Frostman and Rajchman, extending prior work of Pollington \cite{p81} and Lyons \cite{l86}. The Rajchman property completely answers a question of Kahane and Salem \cite{Kahane-Salem-64}, identifying $\mathscr N(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ as a set of multiplicity (in the Fourier-analytic sense) if and only if $(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ is compatible. The methodological contribution of the article is the construction of a class of probability measures called skewed measures. These measures depend on a number of parameters that can be independently adjusted to ensure (subsets of) properties such as almost everywhere normality, non-normality, ball conditions and Fourier decay.</description>

Abstract: We introduce equivariant L-genera associated to actions of Galois and related groups on algebraic varieties.

      <title>On the Iterated Monodromy Groups of Quadratic Rational functions with periodic critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a quadratic rational function defined over a field of characteristic not equal to $2$. We assume that the critical points of $f$ are all periodic. We first determine the geometric iterated monodromy group up to conjugacy and prove that it is of weakly branch type. This type of result was previously only known for the discrete iterated monodromy groups of PCF quadratic polynomials due to work of Bartholdi and Nekrashevyich.
  Furthermore, motivated by a question of Jones and Levy on settled pairs, we study odometers in the iterated monodromy groups of rational functions. We show that if the critical points have non-intersecting orbits, then the geometric iterated monodromy group always have odometers. If the critical points lie in the same orbit, then we give a divisibility condition depending only on the length $r$ of the postcritical set and $s$ where the critical points are given by $p_1$ and $f^{s-1}(p_1)$. We show that in the absence of odometers in the geometric iterated monodromy group, neither the arithmetic iterated monodromy group of $f$ nor the Arboreal representation attached to $(f,\alpha)$, for any $\alpha \in K$, contains any settled elements. This answers the question of Jones and Levy on settled pairs in negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\Gamma$ a Fuchsian Group of the first kind, we obtain large sieve inequalities with weights the hyperbolic periods of Maass forms of even weight. This is inspired by work of Chamizo, who proved a large sieve inequality with weights values of Maass forms of weight $0$. The motivation is applications in counting problems in $\Gamma_1 \backslash \Gamma / \Gamma_2$, where $\Gamma_1$, $\Gamma_2$ are hyperbolic subgroups of $\Gamma$.</description>

Abstract: In 1797, Pfaff gave a simple proof of a ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric series summation formula which was much later reproved by Andrews in 1996. In the same paper, Andrews also proved other well-known hypergeometric identities using Pfaff's method. In this paper, we prove a number of terminating $q$-hypergeometric series-product identities using Pfaff's method thereby providing a detailed account of its wide applicability.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Bloch-P\'olya Theorem on the number of real zeros of polynomials (II)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16120v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there is an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that for every $$a_0,a_1, \ldots,a_n \in [1,M]\,, \qquad 1 \leq M \leq \frac 14 \exp \left( \frac n9 \right)\,,$$ there are $$b_0,b_1,\ldots,b_n \in \{-1,0,1\}$$ such that the polynomial $P$ of the form $\displaystyle{P(z) = \sum_{j=0}^n{b_ja_jz^j}}$ has at least $\displaystyle{c \left( \frac{n}{\log(4M)} \right)^{1/2}-1}$ distinct sign changes in $I_a := (1-2a,1-a)$, where $\displaystyle{a := \left( \frac{\log(4M)}{n} \right)^{1/2} \leq 1/3}$. This improves and extends earlier results of Bloch and P\'olya and Erd\'elyi and, as a special case, recaptures a special case of a more general recent result of Jacob and Nazarov.</description>

      <title>On the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet heuristics lead one to conjecture that the average size of the $p$-torsion in class groups of $G$-extensions of a number field is finite. In a 2021 paper, Lemke Oliver, Wang, and Wood proved this conjecture in the case of $p = 3$ for permutation groups $G$ of the form $C_2 \wr H$ for a broad family of permutation groups $H$, including most nilpotent groups. However, their theorem does not apply for some nilpotent groups of interest, such as $H = C_5$. We extend their results to prove that the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions is finite for any nilpotent group $H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.07633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a 3-dimensional stratum $\mathcal{M}_{3,V}$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_3$ of curves of genus $3$ parameterizing curves $Y$ that admit a certain action of $V= C_2\times C_2$. We determine the possible types of the stable reduction of these curves to characteristic different from $2$. We define invariants for $\mathcal{M}_{3,V}$ and characterize the occurrence of each of the reduction types in terms of them. We also calculate the $j$-invariant (resp. the Igusa invariants) of the irreducible components of positive genus of the stable reduction of $Y$ in terms of the invariants.</description>

      <title>Partition regularity of Pythagorean pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a core partition regularity problem in Ramsey theory by proving that every finite coloring of the positive integers contains monochromatic Pythagorean pairs, i.e., $x,y\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x^2\pm y^2=z^2$ for some $z\in \mathbb{N}$. We also show that partitions generated by level sets of multiplicative functions taking finitely many values always contain Pythagorean triples. Our proofs combine known Gowers uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions with a novel and rather flexible approach based on concentration estimates of multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Extension of Bressoud's generalization of Borwein's conjecture and some exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conjecture an extension to Bressoud's 1996 generalization of Borwein's famous 1990 conjecture. We then state a few infinite hierarchies of non-negative $q$-series identities which are interesting examples of our proposed conjecture and Bressoud's generalized conjecture. Finally, using certain positivity-preserving transformations for $q$-binomial coefficients, we prove the non-negativity of the infinite families.</description>

      <title>Partition regularity of generalized Pythagorean pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address partition regularity problems for homogeneous quadratic equations. A consequence of our main results is that, under natural conditions on the coefficients $a,b,c$, for any finite coloring of the positive integers, there exists a solution to $ax^2+by^2=cz^2$ where $x$ and $y$ have the same color (and similar results for $x,z$ and $y,z$). For certain choices of $(a,b,c)$, our result is conditional on an Elliott-type conjecture. Our proofs build on and extend previous arguments of the authors dealing with the Pythagorean equation. We make use of new uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions and concentration estimates for multiplicative functions along arbitrary binary quadratic forms.</description>
