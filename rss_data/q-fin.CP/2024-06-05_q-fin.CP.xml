      <title>Pricing and calibration in the 4-factor path-dependent volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the path-dependent volatility (PDV) model of Guyon and Lekeufack (2023), where the instantaneous volatility is a linear combination of a weighted sum of past returns and the square root of a weighted sum of past squared returns. We discuss the influence of an additional parameter that unlocks enough volatility on the upside to reproduce the implied volatility smiles of S&amp;P 500 and VIX options. This PDV model, motivated by empirical studies, comes with computational challenges, especially in relation to VIX options pricing and calibration. We propose an accurate neural network approximation of the VIX which leverages on the Markovianity of the 4-factor version of the model. The VIX is learned as a function of the Markovian factors and the model parameters. We use this approximation to tackle the joint calibration of S&amp;P 500 and VIX options.</description>

      <title>Inference of Utilities and Time Preference in Sequential Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stochastic control framework to enhance the capabilities of automated investment managers, or robo-advisors, by accurately inferring clients' investment preferences from past activities. Our approach leverages a continuous-time model that incorporates utility functions and a generic discounting scheme of a time-varying rate, tailored to each client's risk tolerance, valuation of daily consumption, and significant life goals. We address the resulting time inconsistency issue through state augmentation and the establishment of the dynamic programming principle and the verification theorem. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for the identifiability of client investment preferences. To complement our theoretical developments, we propose a learning algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation within a discrete-time Markov Decision Process framework, augmented with entropy regularization. We prove that the log-likelihood function is locally concave, facilitating the fast convergence of our proposed algorithm. Practical effectiveness and efficiency are showcased through two numerical examples, including Merton's problem and an investment problem with unhedgeable risks.
  Our proposed framework not only advances financial technology by improving personalized investment advice but also contributes broadly to other fields such as healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence, where understanding individual preferences is crucial.</description>
