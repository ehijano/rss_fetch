      <title>A Stochastic Approach to the Definition of the Path Integral Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to define a Stochastic Path Integral in Lorentzian time by restricting the relevant domain of integration on $C([0,1],M)$ over a Riemannian configuration manifold (M,g). Through fibration, we define $L^2$-isometric flux spaces in which we consider a stochastic process over which we define a Gaussian measure with respect to which the Path Integral may be rigorously formulated as a functional integral. We prove equivalence to the Euclidean Path Integral theory and the Feynman-Kac theorem.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Dynamical Poisson-Voronoi Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a dynamical network model featuring mobile stations on the Euclidean plane. The initial locations of the stations are given by a homogeneous Poisson point process. The stations are all moving at a constant speed and in a random direction. Consider fixed users located in the Euclidean plane, which are served by the mobile stations. Each user stays connected to the nearest station at any given point of time. Since the stations are moving, an user disconnects and connects with different stations over time, by always selecting which ever station is the closest. This gives rise to a dynamical version of the Poisson-Voronoi tessellation. The focus of this paper is on the sequence of ``handover'' events of a typical user, which are the epochs when its association changes. This defines a point process on the time-axis, the ``handover point process''. We show that this point process is stationary and we determine its main properties, in particular its intensity and the joint distribution of its inter-event times. We also analyze the handover Palm distributions of several variables of practical interest. This includes the distance to the closest mobile stations and the point process of all other mobile stations at handover epochs. The analysis is conducted both in the single-speed and in the multi-speed scenarios. It leads to the identification of the three dimensional state variables that ``Markovize'' the association dynamics. The analysis is based on a specific system of non-compact particles. The motivations are in the modeling of low or medium orbit satellite wireless communication networks. The model studied here is a planar ``caricature'' of this problem, which is initially defined on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the conformally covariant geodesic metric on simple conformal loop ensemble carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for each $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$ there exists a geodesic metric on the carpet of a CLE$_\kappa$ which is canonical in the sense that it is characterized by a certain list of axioms. Our metric can be constructed explicitly as the scaling limit of Minkowski first passage percolation (MFPP), i.e., the metric obtained by taking the infimum of the Lebesgue measure of the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of all paths connecting each pair of points. Earlier work by the first co-author showed that MFPP admits nontrivial subsequential limits. The present paper shows that this subsequential limit is unique and is characterized by our list of axioms. We conjecture that our metric describes the scaling limit of the chemical distance metric for discrete loop models that converge to CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$ in the scaling limit, e.g., the critical Ising model for $\kappa=3$. Our argument is inspired by recent works of Gwynne and Miller and Ding and Gwynne on the uniqueness of Liouville quantum gravity metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider in this article an Elephant Random Walk evolving in the plane. Specifically, this is a reinforced stochastic process in which the $n$th step is given by a random rotation of one of the previous steps chosen uniformly at random. We obtain a central limit theorem for this process, which shows that the process follows a randomly rotated logarithmic spiral at large times, with Gaussian fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Local scaling limits of quadrangulations rooted on geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the local scaling limit of the Uniform Infinite Planar Quadrangulation (UIPQ) and of critical Boltzmann quadrangulations, when one simultaneously rescales the distances and reroot them far away from the root of a distinguished geodesic. The limiting space is the bigeodesic Brownian plane, which appears as the local limit of the Brownian sphere around an interior point of a geodesic. We also show that the $\overline{\mathrm{UIPQ}}$ introduced by Dieuleveut, which is the local limit of the $\mathrm{UIPQ}$ rerooted at a far away point of its infinite geodesic, has the same scaling limit. These results can be seen as a commutation property between local limit, scaling limit and moving forward on a geodesic in random quadrangulations. The proofs are based on spinal decompositions of random trees and coupling results.</description>

      <title>Fixed-magnetization Ising on random graphs up to reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fixed-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model on random $d$-regular graphs for $d\ge 3$ and inverse temperature below the tree reconstruction threshold. Our main result is that for each magnetization $\eta$, the free energy density of the fixed-magnetization Ising model converges to the annealed free energy density, itself the Bethe free energy of an Ising measure on the infinite $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the fixed-magnetization Ising model exhibits local weak convergence to this tree measure. A key challenge to proving these results is that for magnetizations between the model's spinodal points, the limiting tree measure corresponds to an unstable fixed point of the belief propagation equations.
  As an application, we prove that the positive-temperature Zdeborov\'a--Boettcher conjecture on max-cut and min-bisection holds up to the reconstruction threshold: on the random $d$-regular graph, the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model plus the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the zero-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model equals $1+o(1)$.
  A second application is completely determining the large deviation rate function for the magnetization in the Ising model on the random regular graph up to reconstruction.
  Finally, we use the precise understanding of this rate function to show that the Glauber dynamics for the full Ising model on the random graph mixes in sub-exponential time from uniformly random initialization, well into the non-uniqueness regime where the worst-case initialization mixing time is exponentially slow.</description>

      <title>How many outbreaks before an epidemic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the finite-population behaviour of the Reed-Frost epidemic model. Our analysis relies on the exact expression for the final epidemic size, replaced by Monte Carlo simulations in cases where the exact formula becomes numerically unstable. When the initial reproduction number is greater than a critical threshold, the distribution of the final size becomes bimodal. We therefore define the probabilities of small and large outbreaks, providing an intuitive answer to the question posed in the title through simple arguments based on the geometric distribution. Finally, an agent-based simulation confirms that the Reed-Frost model offers a good approximation in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak.</description>

      <title>Gibbs polystability of Fano manifolds, stability thresholds and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the probabilistic approach for constructing Kahler-Einstein metrics on log Fano manifolds - involving random point processes - to the case of non-discrete automorphism groups, by explicitly breaking the symmetry. This yields a new algebraic notion of Gibbs polystability, conjecturally equivalent to K-polystability. The definition involves a limit of log canonical thresholds on the GIT semistable locus of the N-fold products of the Fano manifold that we conjecture coincides with an analytic reduced stability threshold encoding the coercivity of the K-energy functional modulo automorphisms. These conjectures follow from an overarching conjectural Large Deviation Principle for the limit when N tends to infinity. We prove several of our conjectures for log Fano curves and derive a strengthened logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the two-sphere, which implies Aubin's refinement of the Moser-Trudinger inequality. In companion papers we will present applications to Onsager's point vortex model on the two-sphere and the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Random Attractors for McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the existence of random attractors for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations on a separable Hilbert space $H$. A significant challenge arises from the distribution-dependence of the coefficients, thereby causing the lack of the stochastic flow property on $H$. To address this issue, we first transform the original equation into a system on the product space $H \times \mathcal{P}(H)$ and consider the existence of random attractors on this space. We then analyze cocycles associated with two parametric dynamical systems. Within this framework, we define the corresponding pullback random attractor and develop a general theory for the existence of random attractors for such cocycles. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to McKean-Vlasov stochastic ordinary differential equations, McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations, and McKean-Vlasov stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations. In the case where the attractor reduces to a singleton set $\mathcal{A}(\omega):=(\xi(\omega),\mu_\infty)$, we show that $\xi$ corresponds to the stationary solution for the decoupled SPDE,satisfying $\mathbb{P}\circ[\xi]^{-1}=\mu_\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a random process over graphs inspired by the way payments are executed in the Lightning Network, the main layer-two solution on top of Bitcoin. We first prove almost tight upper and lower bounds on the time it takes for a payment failure to occur, as a function of the number of nodes and the edge capacities, when the underlying graph is complete. Then, we show how such a random process is related to the edge-betweenness centrality measure and we prove upper and lower bounds for arbitrary graphs as a function of edge-betweenness and capacity. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by running extensive simulations over some classes of graphs, including snapshots of the real Lightning Network.</description>

      <title>Scenario-based Regularization: A Tractable Framework for Distributionally Robust Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a flexible scenario-based regularized Sample Average Approximation (SBR-SAA) framework for stochastic optimization. This work is motivated by challenges in standard Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (WDRO), where out-of-sample performance, particularly tail risk, is sensitive to the choice of the p-norm, and formulations can be computationally intractable. Our method is inspired by the asymptotic expansion of the WDRO objective and introduces a regularizer that penalizes the (sub)gradient norm of the objective at a selected set of scenarios. This framework serves a dual purpose: (i) it provides a computationally tractable alternative to WDRO by using a representative subset of the data, and (ii) it can provide targeted robustness by incorporating user-defined adverse scenarios. We establish the theoretical properties of this framework by proving its equivalence to a decision-dependent WDRO problem, from which we derive finite sample guarantees and asymptotic consistency. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in two applications: (1) a multi-product newsvendor problem, where SBR-SAA serves as a tractable alternative to NP-hard WDRO, and (2) a mean-risk portfolio optimization problem, where it successfully uses historical crisis data to improve out-of-sample performance.</description>

      <title>Random trees with local catastrophes: the Brownian case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a model of plane random trees generalizing the famous Bienaym\'e--Galton--Watson model but where births and deaths are locally correlated. More precisely, given a random variable $(B,H)$ with values in $\{1,2,3, \dots\}^2$, given the state of the tree at some generation, the next generation is obtained (informally) by successively deleting $B$ individuals side-by-side and replacing them with $H$ new particles where the samplings are i.i.d. We prove that, in the critical case $\mathbb{E}[B]=\mathbb{E}[H]$, and under a third moment condition on $B$ and $H$, the random trees coding the genealogy of the population model converges towards the Brownian Continuum Random Tree. Interestingly, our proof does not use the classical height process or the {\L}ukasiewicz exploration, but rather the stochastic flow point of view introduced by Bertoin and Le Gall.</description>

Abstract: We provide a general It\=o\,-Wentzell formula for a random field of maps on the Wasserstein space of probability measures, defined by continuous semimartingales, and evaluated along the flow of conditional distributions of another continuous semimartingale. Our method follows standard arguments of It\=o calculus, and thus bypasses the approximation by empirical measures commonly used in the existing literature. As an application, we derive the dynamic programming equation for a mean field stochastic control problem with common noise.</description>

Abstract: We establish that if a sequence of electrical networks equipped with conductance measures converges in the local Gromov--Hausdorff-vague topology and satisfies certain non-explosion and metric-entropy conditions,then the sequence of associated discrete-time Markov chains and their local times also converges. This result applies to many examples, such as critical Galton--Watson trees conditioned on size, uniform spanning trees, random recursive fractals, the critical Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph, the configuration model, and the random conductance model on fractals.To obtain the convergence result, we characterize and study extended Dirichlet spaces associated with resistance forms, and we study traces of electrical networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutons are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals that provide a natural way to describe limits of permutations. We are interested in the permuton limits for permutations sampled uniformly from certain pattern-avoiding classes that are in bijection with the class of permutations avoiding the increasing pattern of length $d+1$. In particular, we will look at a family of permutations whose permuton limit collapses to the unique permuton supported on the line $x + y = 1$ in the unit square, informally known as the anti-diagonal. We prove some general properties about permutons to aid our efforts, which may be useful for proving permuton limits that converge to the anti-diagonal for a broader range of permutation classes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that under the domination condition: \begin{equation*} {\cal{E}}^{-\mu,-\nu}[-\xi|{\cal{F}}_t]\leq\rho_t(\xi)\leq{\cal{E}}^{\mu,\nu}[-\xi|{\cal{F}}_t],\quad \forall\xi\in \mathcal{L}^{\exp}_T\ (\text{resp.}\ L^2(\mathcal{F}_T)),\ \forall t\in[0,T], \end{equation*} where ${\cal{E}}^{\mu,\nu}$ is the $g$-expectation with generator $\mu|z|+\nu|z|^2, \mu\geq0, \nu\geq0$, the dynamic convex (resp. coherent) risk measure $\rho$ admits a representation as a $g$-expectation, whose generator $g$ is convex (resp. sublinear) in the variable $z$ and has a quadratic (resp. linear) growth. As an application, we show that such dynamic convex (resp. coherent) risk measure $\rho$ admits a dual representation, where the penalty term (resp. the set of probability measures) is characterized by the corresponding generator $g$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation for Extreme Points in Laguerre tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Gaussian approximation in three particular models of Poisson-Laguerre tessellations, namely, the $\beta$-, $\beta'$- and Gaussian-Voronoi tessellations. The tessellations are constructed based on inhomogeneous Poisson point processes in space-time $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$, where some of the points of the process give rise to a cell in $\mathbb{R}^d$, known as extreme points, while the other points produce an empty cell. Using the notion of region-stabilization, we derive quantitative central limit theorems with presumably optimal rates of convergence for the number of extreme points of $\beta$-, $\beta'$- and Gaussian-Voronoi tessellations in a growing window $W_n=[-n,n]^d$ as $n\to\infty$. Our bounds improve and extend previously known results by Schreiber and Yukich (2008) for the $\beta$-model, and are the first quantitative results for the $\beta'$- and Gaussian models.</description>

      <title>A weak convergence approach to the large deviations of the dynamic Schr\"odinger problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the large deviations for dynamical Schr\"odinger problems, using the variational approach developed by Dupuis, Ellis, Budhiraja, and others. Recent results on scaled families of Schr\"odinger problems, in particular by Bernton, Ghosal, and Nutz, and the authors, have established large deviation principles for the static problem. For the dynamic problem, only the case with a scaled Brownian motion reference process has been explored by Kato.
  Here, we derive large deviations results using the variational approach, with the aim of going beyond the Brownian reference dynamics considered by Kato. Specifically, we develop a uniform Laplace principle for bridge processes conditioned on their endpoints. When combined with existing results for the static problem, this leads to a large deviation principle for the corresponding (dynamic) Schr\"odinger bridge. In addition to the specific results of the paper, our work puts such large deviation questions into the weak convergence framework, and we conjecture that the results can be extended to cover also more involved types of reference dynamics. Specifically, we provide an outlook on applying the result to reflected Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $P(\Phi)_2$-model on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. By establishing coming down from infinity for the associated stochastic nonlinear heat equation (SNLH) on the plane, we first construct a $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane as a limit of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measures on large tori. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane thus constructed, namely, we study the defocusing stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation forced by an additive space-time white noise (= the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model) on the plane. In particular, by taking a limit of the invariant Gibbs dynamics on large tori constructed by the first two authors with Gubinelli and Koch (2021), we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. Our main strategy is to develop further the ideas from a recent work on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model on the three-dimensional torus by the first two authors and Okamoto (2021), and to study convergence of the so-called enhanced Gibbs measures, for which coming down from infinity for the associated SNLH with positive regularity plays a crucial role. By combining wave and heat analysis together with ideas from optimal transport theory, we then conclude global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane and invariance of the associated Gibbs measure. As a byproduct of our argument, we also obtain invariance of the limiting $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane under the dynamics of the parabolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model.</description>

      <title>Maximal Entropy Random Walks in Z: Random and non-random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW) is a natural process on a finite graph, introduced a few years ago with motivations from theoretical physics. The construction of this process relies on Perron-Frobenius theory for adjacency matrices. Generalizing to infinite graphs is rather delicate, and in this article, we treat in a fairly exhaustive manner the case of the MERW on Z with loops, for both random and nonrandom loops. Thanks to an explicit combinatorial representation of the corresponding Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors, we are able to precisely determine the asymptotic behavior of these walks. We show, in particular, that essentially all MERWs on Z with loops have positive speed.</description>

      <title>A mixed finite element method for a class of fourth-order stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete, semi-implicit mixed finite element method for approximating solutions to a class of fourth-order stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz and non-monotone nonlinearities, perturbed by spatially smooth multiplicative Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme is applicable to a range of physically relevant nonlinear models, including the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (sLLBar) equation, the stochastic convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with mass source, and the stochastic regularised Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, among others. To overcome the difficulties posed by the interplay between the nonlinearities and the stochastic forcing, we adopt a `truncate-then-discretise' strategy: the nonlinear term is first truncated before discretising the resulting modified problem. We show that the strong solution to the truncated problem converges in probability to that of the original problem. A fully discrete numerical scheme is then proposed for the truncated system, and we establish both convergence in probability and strong convergence (with quantitative rates) for the two fields used in the mixed formulation. Numerical simulations are provided to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Data Augmentation for Precision Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting. For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>
