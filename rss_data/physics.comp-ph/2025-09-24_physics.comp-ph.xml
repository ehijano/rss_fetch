      <title>A failure mode dependent continuum damage model for laminated composites with optimized model parameters : Application to curved beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a failure mode dependent and thermodynamically consistent continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is proposed for continuum damage modeling of laminated composite panels. The damage model parameters are characterized based on all uniaxial/shear experimental stress-strain curves. Steepest descent optimization algorithm is used to minimize the difference between model predicted and experimental stress-strain curves to get the optimzed model parameters. The fully characterized damage evolution equations are used for damage prediction of a moderately thick laminated composite curved beam modeled using first-order shear deformation theory. Finite element method with load control is used to get the non-linear algebraic equations which are solved using Newton Raphson method. The developed model is compared with the existing failure mode dependent and failure mode independent damage models. The results depict the efficacy of the proposed model to capture non-linearity in the load vs deflection curve due to stiffness degradation and different damage in tension andcompression consistent with uniaxial/shear stress-strain response and strength properties of the material, respectively.</description>

      <title>3D Blocking for Matrix-free Smoothers in 2D Variable-Viscosity Stokes Equations with Applications to Geodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++ Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic. These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Field Inversion for Sparse Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods keep increasing their popularity in engineering applications, given the developments in data analysis techniques. Some of these approaches, such as Field Inversion Machine Learning (FIML), suggest correcting low-fidelity models by leveraging available observations of the problem. However, the solely data-driven field inversion stage of the method generally requires dense observations that limit the usage of sparse data. In this study, we propose a physical loss term addition to the field inversion stage of the FIML technique similar to the physics-informed machine learning applications. This addition embeds the complex physics of the problem into the low-fidelity model, which allows for obtaining dense gradient information for every correction parameter and acts as an adaptive regularization term improving inversion accuracy. The proposed Physics-Informed Field Inversion approach is tested using three different examples and highlights that incorporating physical loss can enhance the reconstruction performance for limited data cases, such as sparse, truncated, and noisy observations. Additionally, this modification enables us to obtain accurate posterior correction parameter distribution with limited realizations, making it data-efficient. The increase in the computational cost caused by the physical loss calculation is at an acceptable level given the relaxed grid and numerical scheme requirements.</description>

      <title>A flux bounce-back scheme for the filtered Spectral Element Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral element lattice Boltzmann method (SELBM) with the flux bounce-back (FBB) scheme, to enable accurate simulations of single-phase fluid dynamics in unstructured mesh. We adopt an Eulerian description of the streaming process in place of the perfect shift in the regular LBM. The spectral element method is used to spatially discretize the convective term, while the strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method is used for time integration. To increase stability, we investigate the use of an explicit filter, particularly in the context of the sensitive double shear layer problem. The results indicate that by using the high-order polynomial, we can effectively eliminate the small vortices around the neck region. We introduce the flux bounce-back scheme to enable the current scheme to handle complex boundaries. The proposed scheme and flux boundary method are validated through benchmark simulations, including the unsteady Couette flow and the planar Poiseuille flow. Further validation is provided through the Taylor-Green vortex problem, demonstrating the accuracy and convergence of the scheme for isotropic turbulence. Finally, we consider a fully developed turbulent flow within a cylindrical pipe and correctly predict the turbulent boundary layer profile.</description>

      <title>Latent Representation Learning of Multi-scale Thermophysics: Application to Dynamics in Shocked Porous Energetic Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.</description>

      <title>STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator (STACIE): Robust and accurate transport properties from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: STACIE (STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator) is a novel algorithm and Python package that delivers robust, uncertainty-aware estimates of autocorrelation integrals from time-correlated data. While its primary application is deriving transport properties from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, STACIE is equally applicable to time-correlated data in other scientific fields. A key feature of STACIE is its ability to provide robust and accurate estimates without requiring manual adjustment of hyperparameters. Additionally, one can follow a simple protocol to prepare sufficient simulation data to achieve a desired relative error of the transport property. We demonstrate its application by estimating the ionic electrical conductivity of a NaCl-water electrolyte solution. We also present a massive synthetic benchmark dataset to rigorously validate STACIE, comprising 15360 sets of time-correlated inputs generated with diverse covariance kernels with known autocorrelation integrals. STACIE is open source and available on GitHub and PyPI, with comprehensive documentation and examples.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: a practical recipe for four-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>
