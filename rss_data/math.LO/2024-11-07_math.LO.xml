      <title>On the optimality of the HOD dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the manuscript, we establish several consistency results concerning Woodin's $\HOD$ hypothesis and large cardinals around the level of extendibility. First, we prove that the first extendible cardinal can be the first strongly compact in HOD. We extend a former result of Woodin by showing that under the HOD hypothesis the first extendible cardinal is $C^{(1)}$-supercompact in HOD. We also show that the first cardinal-correct extendible may not be extendible, thus answering a question by Gitman and Osinski \cite[\S9]{GitOsi}.
  In the second part of the manuscript, we discuss the extent to which weak covering can fail below the first supercompact cardinal $\delta$ in a context where the HOD hypothesis holds. Answering a question of Cummings et al. \cite{CumFriGol}, we show that under the $\HOD$ hypothesis there are many singulars $\kappa&lt;\delta$ where $\cf^{\HOD}(\kappa)=\cf(\kappa)$ and $\kappa^{+\HOD}=\kappa^{+}.$ In contrast, we also show that the $\HOD$ hypothesis is consistent with $\delta$ carrying a club of $\HOD$-regulars cardinals $\kappa$ such that $\kappa^{+\HOD}&lt;\kappa^{+}$. Finally, we close the manuscript with a discussion about the $\HOD$ hypothesis and $\omega$-strong measurability.</description>

      <title>Inquisitive Neighborhood Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an inquisitive modal logic designed to reason about neighborhood models. This logic is based on an inquisitive strict conditional operator, which quantifies over neighborhoods, and which can be applied to both statements and questions. In terms of this operator we also define two unary modalities that function respectively as a universal and existential quantifier over neighborhoods. We prove that the expressive power of this logic matches the natural notion of bisimilarity in neighborhood models. We show that certain fragments of the language are invariant under certain modifications of the set of neighborhoods, and use this to show that our conditional modality is not definable from the induced unary modalities, and that questions embedded on the right of this conditional are indispensable. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization of our logic, both in general and in restriction to some salient frame classes, and discuss the relations between our logic and other modal logics interpreted over neighborhood models.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We bi-interprete these theories in terms of real closed fields and we prove they are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis since they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of their zero loci from model completeness and we prove the failure of quantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas.</description>
