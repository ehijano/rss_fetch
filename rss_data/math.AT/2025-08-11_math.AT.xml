      <title>On distributional one-category, diagonal distributional complexity, and related invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of probabilistic variants of the one-category and diagonal topological complexity, which bound the classical LS-category and topological complexity from below. Unlike any other classical or probabilistic invariants, these invariants are rigid on spaces with finite fundamental group. On Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, we identify these new invariants with distributional category and complexity, respectively, and use them to illuminate aspects of the behavior of the latter invariants on aspherical spaces and products of spaces. We also study their properties on covering maps, $\pi_1$-isomorphisms, $H$-spaces, and closed essential manifolds, and consequently, obtain the first examples of closed manifolds beyond the real projective spaces on which the distributional theory disagrees with the classical one.</description>

      <title>On Targeted Complexity of Discrete Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete topological complexity $TC(K)$ introduced for situations where the configuration space possesses a simplicial structure. %Simplicial complexes are well-known and commonly used in programming for robotic motion. Let $K$ be a complex and let $L$ be a subcomplex considered as the target of the motion. We introduce targeted simplicial complexity $TC(K,L)$, which yields smaller values than the discrete version $TC(K)$. We then demonstrate that targeted simplicial complexity is strongly homotopy invariant and it varies between simplicial LS-categories of $K$ and $K \prod K$. Utilizing this information, we calculate targeted simplicial complexity for scenarios such as strongly collapsible complexes. Finally, we compare targeted simplicial complexity with relative topological complexity and we show that $TC(|K|, |L|) \le TC (K,L)$ where $|\cdot|$ denotes the geometric realization functor. Although relative topological complexity is generally lower than targeted simplicial complexity, they are equal in certain cases, such as arbitrary wedges of triangulated circles.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Modules, the Infinite Root Algebra and the Generating Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis concerns the algebraic consequences of Freyd's Generating Hypothesis, and explores the question of whether there exists a self-injective ring R that can be constructed purely algebraically that exhibits some of the known properties of the stable homotopy ring, including some conjectured properties that follow from Freyd's Generating Hypothesis. As an example, we investigate the infinite root algebra of Hahn series P, firstly by establishing results for the related Hahn ring A. In particular, we prove that the Theta-reflexive A-modules and the multibasic A-modules are the same.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of Symmetry in Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in understanding natural phenomena and mathematical structures. This work develops a comprehensive theory for studying the persistent symmetries and degree of asymmetry of finite point configurations over parameterization in metric spaces. Leveraging category theory and span categories, we define persistent symmetry groups and introduce novel invariants called symmetry barcodes and polybarcodes that capture the birth, death, persistence, and reappearance of symmetries over parameter evolution. Metrics and stability theorems are established for these invariants. The concept of symmetry types is formalized via the action of isometry groups in configuration spaces. To quantitatively characterize symmetry and asymmetricity, measures such as degree of symmetry and symmetry defect are introduced, the latter revealing connections to approximate group theory in Euclidean settings. Moreover, a theory of persistence representations of persistence groups is developed, generalizing the classical decomposition theorem of persistence modules. Persistent Fourier analysis on persistence groups is further proposed to characterize dynamic phenomena including symmetry breaking and phase transitions. Algorithms for computing symmetry groups, barcodes, and symmetry defect in low-dimensional spaces are presented, complemented by discussions on extending symmetry analysis beyond geometric contexts. This work thus bridges geometric group theory, topological data analysis, representation theory, and machine learning, providing novel tools for the analysis of the parametrized symmetry of data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalization of the ring spectrum of topological modular forms, we construct a graded ring spectrum of topological Jacobi forms, $\operatorname{TJF}_*$. This is constructed as the global sections of a sheaf of $E_\infty$-ring spectra on the stacky universal elliptic curve using circle-equivariant $\operatorname{TMF}$. Complete calculations of its homotopy at odd primes and partial results at $p=2$ are given.</description>

      <title>Flagifying the Dowker Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dowker complex $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ is a simplicial complex capturing the topological interplay between two finite sets $X$ and $Y$ under some relation $R\subseteq X\times Y$. While its definition is asymmetric, the famous Dowker duality states that $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$ and $\mathrm{D}_{R}(Y,X)$ have homotopy equivalent geometric realizations. We introduce the Dowker-Rips complex $\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y)$, defined as the flagification of the Dowker complex or, equivalently, as the maximal simplicial complex whose $1$-skeleton coincides with that of $\mathrm{D}_{R}(X,Y)$. This is motivated by applications in topological data analysis, since as a flag complex, the Dowker-Rips complex is less expensive to compute than the Dowker complex. While the Dowker duality does not hold for Dowker-Rips complexes in general, we show that one still has that $\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(X,Y))\cong\mathrm{H}_{i}(\mathrm{DR}_{R}(Y,X))$ for $i=0,1$. We further show that this weakened duality extends to the setting of persistent homology, and quantify the ``failure" of the Dowker duality in homological dimensions higher than $1$ by means of interleavings. This makes the Dowker-Rips complex a less expensive, approximate version of the Dowker complex that is usable in topological data analysis. Indeed, we provide a Python implementation of the Dowker-Rips complex and, as an application, we show that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Dowker complex in a tumor microenvironment classification pipeline. In that pipeline, using the Dowker-Rips complex leads to increase in speed while retaining classification performance.</description>

      <title>Thomason-Type Model Structures on Simplicial Complexes and Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Matsushita model structure on loop graphs, which is right-transferred from the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets, factors through two other right-transferred model structures on simplicial complexes and reflexive graphs. We show that each Quillen adjunction between these right-transferred model categories is a Quillen equivalence. These model structures are analogous to the Thomason model structure on small categories, and we prove that they are all cofibrantly generated and proper. Furthermore we show that all cofibrant simplicial complexes are flag complexes, and all forests are cofibrant.</description>

      <title>A decomposition of graph a-numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $a$-sequence $(a_0(G), a_1(G), \cdots)$ of a finite simple graph $G$, defined recursively through a combinatorial rule and known to coincide with the sequence of rational Betti numbers of the real toric variety associated with $G$.
  In this paper, we establish a combinatorial and topological decomposition formula for the $a$-sequence. As an application, we show that the $a$-sequence is monotone under graph inclusion; that is, $a_i(G) \geq a_i(H)$ for all $i \geq 0$ whenever $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. We also prove that the $a$-sequence is unimodal in $i$ for a broad class of graphs $G$, including those with a Hamiltonian circuit or a universal vertex. These results provide a new class of topological spaces whose Betti number sequences are unimodal but not necessarily log concave, contributing to the study of real loci in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Hermitian K-theory of Lagrangian Grassmannians via reducible Gorenstein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of moduli spaces, called generalized Lagrangian flag schemes, that are reducible Gorenstein (hence singular), and that admit well-behaved pushforward and pullback operations in Hermitian $K$-theory. These schemes arise naturally in our computations. Using them, we prove that the Hermitian $K$-theory of a Lagrangian Grassmannian over a regular base splits as a direct sum of copies of the base's (Hermitian) $K$-theory, indexed by certain shifted Young diagrams. The isomorphism is realized via pullback to each generalized Lagrangian flag scheme followed by pushforward to the Lagrangian Grassmannian. This yields an unusual example in which both the base and the target are regular schemes, while the intermediate reducible Gorenstein models remain sufficient to allow explicit computations in Hermitian K-theory of regular schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filter quotient construction is a particular instance of a filtered colimit of categories. It has primarily been considered in the context of categorical logic, where it has been used effectively to construct non-trivial models, for example new models of set theory.
  In this work we prove that given a model category and a suitable notion of filter of subterminal objects, the filter quotient construction will preserve the model structure. We also show that this new model structure inherits certain important properties (such as being simplicial or proper), but not all (such as being cofibrantly generated). Finally, we show it is compatible with the construction of filter quotient $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rational Betti numbers of real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra. We consider the poset topology of a specific poset induced from a chordal building set, and show its EL-shellability. Based on this, we present an explicit description using alternating $\mathcal{B}$-permutations for a chordal building set $\mathcal{B}$, transforming the computing Betti numbers into a counting problem. This approach allows us to compute the $a$-number of a finite simple graph through permutation counting when the graph is chordal. In addition, we provide detailed computations for specific cases such as real Hochschild varieties corresponding to Hochschild polytopes.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in our understanding of higher derived limits carry multiple implications in the fields of condensed and pyknotic mathematics, as well as for the study of strong homology. These implications are thematically diverse, pertaining, for example, to the sheaf theory of extremally disconnected spaces, to Banach--Smith duality, to the productivity of compact projective condensed anima, and to the structure of the derived category of condensed abelian groups. Underlying each of these implications are the combinatorics of multidimensionally coherent families of functions of small infinite cardinal height, and it is for this reason that we convene accounts of them together herein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any CDG-ring $B^\bullet=(B^*,d,h)$, we show that the homotopy category of graded-projective (left) CDG-modules over $B^\bullet$ is equivalent to the quotient category of the homotopy category of graded-flat CDG-modules by its full triangulated subcategory of flat CDG-modules. The contraderived category (in the sense of Becker) $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is the common name for these two triangulated categories. We also prove that the classes of cotorsion and graded-cotorsion CDG-modules coincide, and the contraderived category of CDG-modules is equivalent to the homotopy category of graded-flat graded-cotorsion CDG-modules. Assuming the graded ring $B^*$ to be graded right coherent, we show that the contraderived category $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is compactly generated and its full subcategory of compact objects is anti-equivalent to the full subcategory of compact objects in the coderived category of right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bco}}(\mathbf{Mod}{-}B^\bullet)$. Specifically, the latter triangulated category is the idempotent completion of the absolute derived category of finitely presented right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{abs}}(\mathbf{mod}{-}B^\bullet)$.</description>

Abstract: We study homotopy properties of regular mappings from spheres into a real retract rational variety $Y$. We show that the homotopy classes which are represented by such mappings form subgroups of the homotopy groups of $Y$, and that the groups are independent of the choice of the basepoint on $Y$ as long as $Y$ is connected. We also construct regular representatives of all the Whitehead products in all the homotopy groups of $Y$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the dualizable localizing ideals of rigidly-compactly generated tt-$\infty$-categories that are cohomologically stratified. By definition, these are the localizing ideals that are dualizable with respect to the Lurie tensor product. We prove that these ideals correspond to the convex subsets of the Balmer spectrum. More generally, we establish this classification for categories which are locally cohomologically stratified and whose Balmer spectrum is noetherian. The classification thus applies to many categories arising in algebra and topology, including derived categories of noetherian schemes. Our result generalizes, and is motivated by, a recent theorem of Efimov which establishes this classification for derived categories of commutative noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>
