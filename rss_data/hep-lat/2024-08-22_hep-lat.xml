      <title>Phase diagram of a generalized Stephanov model for finite-density QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a random matrix model for QCD at finite chemical potential, obtained by generalizing the Stephanov model by modifying the random-matrix integration measure with a one-parameter trace deformation. This allows one to check how important the integration measure is for the qualitative features of random matrix models, as well as to test the robustness and universality of the qualitative picture of the original model. While for a small trace deformation the phase diagram is identical to that of the Stephanov model, for a large deformation an exotic phase with spontaneous charge-conjugation breaking appears.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>QCD in the chiral SU(3) limit from baryon masses on Lattice QCD ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryon masses on CLS ensembles are used to determine the LEC that characterize QCD in the flavor-SU(3) limit with vanishing up, down, and strange quark masses. Here we reevaluate some of the baryon masses on flavor-symmetric ensembles with much-improved statistical precision, in particular for the decuplet states. These additional results then lead to a more significant chiral extrapolation of the Lattice data set to its chiral SU(3) limit. Our results are based on the chiral Lagrangian with baryon octet and decuplet fields considered at the one-loop level. Finite-box and discretization effects of the Lattice data are considered systematically. While in our global fit of the data we insist on large-Nc sum rules for the LEC that enter at N3LO, all other LEC are unconstrained. In particular, we obtain values for the chiral limit of the pion decay constant and the isospin-limit of the quark-mass ratio compatible with the FLAG report.</description>
