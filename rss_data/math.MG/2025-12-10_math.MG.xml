      <title>Equilateral n-gons in planar integer lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of equilateral polygons in planar integer lattices. Maehara showed that it's sufficient to work with rectangular lattices $\Lambda(m) = L[(1,0),(0,\sqrt{m})]$ with $m \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. Building on results of Maehara and of Iino and Sakiyama, we show that for every such $m$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, the lattice $\Lambda(m)$ contains an equilateral $n$-gon. This extends previous classifications of equilateral polygons in planar lattices.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Functional Affine Surface Areas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characterization of valuations on the space of convex Lipschitz functions whose domain is a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is obtained. It is shown that every upper semicontinuous, equi-affine and dually epi-translation invariant valuation can be written as a linear combination of a constant term, the volume of the domain, and a functional affine surface area. In addition, dual statements for finite-valued convex functions are established.</description>

      <title>A constant rank theorem for linear elliptic equations on the sphere with applications to the mixed Christoffel problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixed Christoffel problem for $C^{2,+}$ convex bodies providing sufficient conditions for its solution. Key to our approach is a constant rank theorem, following the approach developed in \cite{Guan-Ma-2003} to address the Christoffel problem, in order to ensure that the solution to a related second order linear PDE on the sphere is indeed geometric, that is, it is the support functions of a $C^{2,+}$ convex body.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Labeled Datasets: Gromov-Hausdorff Stability and Generalized Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Techniques from metric geometry have become fundamental tools in modern mathematical data science, providing principled methods for comparing datasets modeled as finite metric spaces. Two of the central tools in this area are the Gromov-Hausdorff distance and persistent homology, both of which yield isometry-invariant notions of distance between datasets. However, these frameworks do not account for categorical labels, which are intrinsic to many real-world datasets, such as labeled images, pre-clustered data, and semantically segmented shapes. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for labeled metric spaces and develop new notions of Gromov-Hausdorff distance and persistent homology which are adapted to this setting. Our main result shows that our persistent homology construction is stable with respect to our novel notion of Gromov-Hausdorff distance, extending a classic result in topological data analysis. To facilitate computation, we also introduce a labeled version of persistence landscapes and show that the landscape map is Lipschitz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein distance as well as its variants have been widely considered in comparing probability measures defined on $\mathbb R^d$. Here we derive the notion of sliced Wasserstein distance for measures on an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert spaces, depict the relation between sliced Wasserstein distance and narrow convergence of measures and quantize the approximation via empirical measures.</description>

      <title>Minimal dispersion on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal spherical cap dispersion ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ is the largest number $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ such that, for every $n$ points on the $d$-dimensional Euclidean unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, there exists a spherical cap with normalized area $\varepsilon$ not containing any of these points. We study the behavior of ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ as $n$ and $d$ grow to infinity. We develop connections to the problems of sphere covering and approximation of the Euclidean unit ball by inscribed polytopes. Existing and new results are presented in a unified way. Upper bounds on ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ result from choosing the points independently and uniformly at random and possibly adding some well-separated points to close large gaps. Moreover, we study dispersion with respect to intersections of caps.</description>

      <title>Fixed and periodic points of the intersection body operators of lower orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the intersection body operator of lower order $I_iK$ of a star body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $i\in\{1, 2,\ldots, n-2\}$, we prove that $I_i^2K = cK$ iff $K$ is an origin-symmetric ball, and hence $I_iK = cK$ iff $K$ is an origin-symmetric ball. Combining the recent breakthrough (case $i = n-1$) of Milman, Shabelman and Yehudayoff (Invent. Math., 241 (2025), 509-558), slight modifications of two long-standing questions 8.6 and 8.7 posed by R. Gardner (Page 302, Geometric Tomography, Cambridge University Press, 1995) are completely solved. As applications, we show that for the spherical Radon transform $\mathcal{R}$, a non-negative $\rho\in L^{\infty}(\mathcal{S}^{n-1})$ satisfies $\mathcal{R}(\rho^i) = c\rho$ for some $c&gt;0$ iff $\rho$ is constant. Also, the sharp Busemann intersection type inequalities are established.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality, and a curvature-driven pre-compactness result. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Computing the Tropical Abel--Jacobi Transform and Tropical Distances for Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric graphs are important models for capturing the structure of complex data across various domains. While much effort has been devoted to extracting geometric and topological features from graph data, computational aspects of metric graphs as abstract tropical curves remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first computational and machine learning-driven study of metric graphs from the perspective of tropical algebraic geometry. Specifically, we study the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform, a vectorization of points on a metric graph via the tropical Abel--Jacobi map into its associated flat torus, the tropical Jacobian. We develop algorithms to compute this transform and investigate how the resulting embeddings depend on different combinatorial models of the same metric graph.
  Once embedded, we compute pairwise distances between points in the tropical Jacobian under two natural metrics: the tropical polarization distance and the Foster--Zhang distance. Computing these distances are generally NP-hard as they turn out to be linked to classical lattice problems in computational complexity, however, we identify a class of metric graphs where fast and explicit computations are feasible. For the general case, we propose practical algorithms for both exact and approximate distance matrix computations using lattice basis reduction and mixed-integer programming solvers. Our work lays the groundwork for future applications of tropical geometry and the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform in machine learning and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Cell structure of bipartite mediangle graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genevois introduced and investigated mediangle graphs as a common generalization of median graphs (1-sekeleta of CAT(0) cube complexes) and Coxeter graphs (Cayley graphs of Coxeter systems) and studied groups acting on them. He asked if mediangle graphs can be endowed with the structure of a contractible cell complex. We answer this in the affirmative by proving that bipartite mediangle graphs are tope graphs of finitary Complexes of Oriented Matroids (COMs). We also show that the oriented matroids (OMs) constituting the cells of COMs arising from bipartite mediangle graphs are exactly the simplicial OMs.</description>

      <title>Tracially lyriform $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metric Choquet simplices are special kinds of compact quantum metric spaces designed for distance measurement in and around the category of stably finite Elliott-classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. The primary objective of this article is to introduce versions of these structures for which the associated tracial metrics need not be induced by Lipschitz seminorms and may induce strictly stronger topologies than the weak$^*$-topology. The resulting category of 'tracially lyriform $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras' behaves well with respect to sequential inductive limits and accommodates the full family of classical $p$-Wasserstein metrics on probability spaces, including $p=\infty$. Examples of projectionless, classifiable tracial Wasserstein spaces are built as noncommutative spaces of observables of certain compact length spaces, including: fractals like the Sierpi\'nski gasket, the Sierpi\'nski carpet and the Menger sponge; finite-dimensional Alexandrov spaces with two-sided curvature bounds; and metric spaces like simplicial spheres and balls that are Lipschitz equivalent to Riemannian. These simplicial structures are used as building blocks that furnish arbitrary simple inductive limits of prime dimension drop algebras with tracial lyriform structure. Appealing to optimal transport theory, we study the geometry and statistics of the spaces of embeddings of these building blocks and their limits into suitable classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras like the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ or the universal UHF algebra $\mathcal{Q}$.</description>
