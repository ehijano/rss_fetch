      <title>Sharp one-point estimates and Minkowski content for the scaling limit of three-dimensional loop-erased random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk (LERW) in three dimensions and prove that the limiting occupation measure is equivalent to its $\beta$-dimensional Minkowski content, where $\beta \in (1, 5/3]$ is its Hausdorff dimension. In doing this we also establish the existence of the two-point function and provide some sharp estimates on one-point function and ball-hitting probabilities for 3D LERW in any scale, which is a considerable improvement of previous results.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-shaped random matrices, $\lambda$-plane trees, and $\lambda$-Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random matrices whose shape is the dilation $N\lambda$ of a self-conjugate Young diagram $\lambda$. In the large-$N$ limit, the empirical distribution of the squared singular values converges almost surely to a probability distribution $F^{\lambda}$. The moments of $F^{\lambda}$ enumerate two combinatorial objects: $\lambda$-plane trees and $\lambda$-Dyck paths, which we introduce and show to be in bijection. We also prove that the distribution $F^{\lambda}$ is algebraic, in the sense of Rao and Edelman. In the case of fat hook shapes we provide explicit formulae for $F^{\lambda}$ and we express it as a free convolution of two measures involving a Marchenko-Pastur and a Bernoulli distribution.</description>

      <title>Renewal theorems in a periodic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a renewal problem within a periodic environment, departing from the classical renewal theory by relaxing the assumption of independent and identically distributed inter-arrival times. Instead, the conditional distribution of the next arrival time, given the current one, is governed by a periodic kernel, denoted as $H$. The periodicity property of $H$ is expressed as $\mathbb{P}(T_{k+1} &gt; t ~ |~ T_k) = H(t, T_k)$, where $H(t+T,s+T) = H(t, s)$. For a fixed time $t$, we define $N_t$ as the count of events occurring up to time $t$. The focus is on two temporal aspects: $Y_t$, the time elapsed since the last event, and $X_t$, the time until the next event occurs, given by $Y_t = t - T_{N_t}$ and $X_t = T_{N_{t}+1} - t$. The study explores the long-term behavior of the distributions of $X_t$ and $Y_t$.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Aggregation with Error Bounds on Transient Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the existing theory of formal error bounds for the transient distribution of an aggregated (or lumped) Markov chain when compared to the transient distribution of the original chain, for both discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains. In the discrete-time setting, we bound the stepwise increment of the error, and in the continuous-time setting, we bound the rate at which the error grows. We then compare these error bounds with relevant concepts in the literature such as exact and ordinary lumpability as well as deflatability and aggregatability. These concepts define stricter than necessary conditions to identify settings in which the aggregation error is zero. We also consider possible algorithms for finding suitable aggregations for which the formal error bounds are low, and we analyse first experiments with these algorithms on different models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with a sample size of a thousand million.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the family of continuous functions $f\in C([0,1])$ such that the iterates $\widehat{T}^{k}_{i} f$ converge uniformly on $[0,1]$, where $\widehat{T}_i$ is a generalized Kantorovich operator. This gives an affirmative answer to the problem raised in 2021 by Acu and Rasa.</description>

      <title>On fluctuations of complexity measures for the FIND algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FIND algorithm (also called Quickselect) is a fundamental algorithm to select ranks or quantiles within a set of data. It was shown by Gr\"ubel and R\"osler that the number of key comparisons required by Find as a process of the quantiles $\alpha\in[0,1]$ in a natural probabilistic model converges after normalization in distribution within the c\`adl\`ag space $D[0,1]$ endowed with the Skorokhod metric. We show that the process of the residuals in the latter convergence after normalization converges in distribution to a mixture of Gaussian processes in $D[0,1]$ and identify the limit's conditional covariance functions. A similar result holds for the related algorithm QuickVal. Our method extends to other cost measures such as the number of swaps (key exchanges) required by Find or cost measures which are based on key comparisons but take into account that the cost of a comparison between two keys may depend on their values, an example being the number of bit comparisons needed to compare keys given by their bit expansions.</description>

      <title>Parity questions in critical planar Brownian loop-soups (or "where did the free planar bosons go?")</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup is an infinite collection of non-interacting Brownian loops in a planar domain that possesses some combinatorial features related to the notion of indistinguishability of bosons. The properly renormalized occupation time field of this collection of loops is known to be distributed like the properly defined square of a Gaussian free field. In the present paper, we investigate aspects of the question about how much information these fields provide about the loop-soup. Among other things, we show that the exact set of points that are actually visited by some loops in the loop-soup is not determined by these fields. We further prove that given the fields, a dense family of special points will each have a conditional probability 1/2 of being part of the loop-soup. We also exhibit another instance where the possible decompositions (given the field) into individual loops and excursions can be grouped into two clearly different groups, each having a conditional probability 1/2 of occurring.</description>

Abstract: We review the limit shape problem for the Plancherel measure and its generalizations found in supersymmetric gauge theory instanton count. We focus on the measure, interpolating between the Plancherel measure and uniform measure, a U(1) case of N=2* gauge theory. We give the formula for its limit shape in terms of elliptic functions, generalizing the trigonometric ``arcsin'' law of Vershik-Kerov and Logan-Schepp.</description>

      <title>Cyclical Long Memory: Decoupling, Modulation, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model for general cyclical long memory is introduced, by means of random modulation of certain bivariate long memory time series. This construction essentially decouples the two key features of cyclical long memory: quasi-periodicity and long-term persistence. It further allows for a general cyclical phase in cyclical long memory time series. Several choices for suitable bivariate long memory series are discussed, including a parametric fractionally integrated vector ARMA model. The parametric models introduced in this work have explicit autocovariance functions that can be used readily in simulation, estimation, and other tasks.</description>

      <title>The entropic doubling constant and robustness of Gaussian codebooks for additive-noise channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy comparison inequalities are obtained for the differential entropy $h(X+Y)$ of the sum of two independent random vectors $X,Y$, when one is replaced by a Gaussian. For identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$, these are closely related to bounds on the entropic doubling constant, which quantifies the entropy increase when adding an independent copy of a random vector to itself. Consequences of both large and small doubling are explored. For the former, lower bounds are deduced on the entropy increase when adding an independent Gaussian, while for the latter, a qualitative stability result for the entropy power inequality is obtained. In the more general case of non-identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$, a Gaussian comparison inequality with interesting implications for channel coding is established: For additive-noise channels with a power constraint, Gaussian codebooks come within a $\frac{{\sf snr}}{3{\sf snr}+2}$ factor of capacity. In the low-SNR regime this improves the half-a-bit additive bound of Zamir and Erez (2004). Analogous results are obtained for additive-noise multiple access channels, and for linear, additive-noise MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>On the nonconvexity of some push-forward constraints and its consequences in machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The push-forward operation enables one to redistribute a probability measure through a deterministic map. It plays a key role in statistics and optimization: many learning problems (notably from optimal transport, generative modeling, and algorithmic fairness) include constraints or penalties framed as push-forward conditions on the model. However, the literature lacks general theoretical insights on the (non)convexity of such constraints and its consequences on the associated learning problems. This paper aims at filling this gap. In a first part, we provide a range of sufficient and necessary conditions for the (non)convexity of two sets of functions: the maps transporting one probability measure to another; the maps inducing equal output distributions across distinct probability measures. This highlights that for most probability measures, these push-forward constraints are not convex. In a second time, we show how this result implies critical limitations on the design of convex optimization problems for learning generative models or group-fair predictors. This work will hopefully help researchers and practitioners have a better understanding of the critical impact of push-forward conditions onto convexity.</description>

      <title>Many-sided Poisson-Voronoi cells with only Gabriel neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p_n^G$ be the probability for a planar Poisson-Voronoi cell to be $n$-sided {\it and\,} have only Gabriel neighbors. Using an exact coordinate transformation followed by scaling arguments and a mean-field type calculation, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of $\log p_n^G$ in the limit of large $n$. We determine several statistical properties of a many-sided cell obeying this `Gabriel condition.' In particular, the cell perimeter, when parametrized as a function $\tau(\theta)$ of the polar angle $\theta$, behaves as a Brownian bridge on the interval $0\le\theta\le 2\pi$. We point out similarities and differences with related problems in random geometry.</description>

      <title>Low coordinate degree algorithms I: Universality of computational thresholds for hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF) -- linear combinations of functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector -- can hypothesis test between high-dimensional probability measures. These functions are a generalization, proposed in Hopkins' 2018 thesis but seldom studied since, of low degree polynomials (LDP), a class widely used in recent literature as a proxy for all efficient algorithms for tasks in statistics and optimization. Instead of the orthogonal polynomial decompositions used in LDP calculations, our analysis of LCDF is based on the Efron-Stein or ANOVA decomposition, making it much more broadly applicable. By way of illustration, we prove channel universality for the success of LCDF in testing for the presence of sufficiently "dilute" random signals through noisy channels: the efficacy of LCDF depends on the channel only through the scalar Fisher information for a class of channels including nearly arbitrary additive i.i.d. noise and nearly arbitrary exponential families. As applications, we extend lower bounds against LDP for spiked matrix and tensor models under additive Gaussian noise to lower bounds against LCDF under general noisy channels. We also give a simple and unified treatment of the effect of censoring models by erasing observations at random and of quantizing models by taking the sign of the observations. These results are the first computational lower bounds against any large class of algorithms for all of these models when the channel is not one of a few special cases, and thereby give the first substantial evidence for the universality of several statistical-to-computational gaps.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic fluctuations in supercritical Crump-Mode-Jagers processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.00867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a supercritical Crump--Mode--Jagers process $(\mathcal Z_t^{\varphi})_{t \geq 0}$ counted with a random characteristic $\varphi$. Nerman's celebrated law of large numbers [Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 57, 365--395, 1981] states that, under some mild assumptions, $e^{-\alpha t} \mathcal Z_t^\varphi$ converges almost surely as $t \to \infty$ to $aW$. Here, $\alpha&gt;0$ is the Malthusian parameter, $a$ is a constant and $W$ is the limit of Nerman's martingale, which is positive on the survival event. In this general situation, under additional (second moment) assumptions, we prove a central limit theorem for $(\mathcal Z_t^{\varphi})_{t \geq 0}$. More precisely, we show that there exist a constant $k \in \mathbb N_0$ and a function $H(t)$, a finite random linear combination of functions of the form $t^j e^{\lambda t}$ with $\alpha/2 \leq \mathrm{Re}(\lambda)&lt;\alpha$, such that $(\mathcal Z_t^\varphi - a e^{\alpha t}W -H(t))/\sqrt{t^k e^{\alpha t}}$ converges in distribution to a normal random variable with random variance. This result unifies and extends various central limit theorem-type results for specific branching processes.</description>

      <title>An overarching framework for compound-Poisson INAR and INGARCH models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The INAR (integer-valued autoregressive) and INGARCH (integer-valued GARCH) classes are among the most commonly employed approaches for count time series modelling, but have been studied in largely distinct strands of literature. In this paper, a model class unifying a large number of INAR and INGARCH models is introduced and its stochastic properties are studied. The starting point is given by a novel thinning-based representation of compound-Poisson INGARCH processes, which is subsequently generalized. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR($p$) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH($p$) to the INGARCH($p$, $q$) model. Models from the class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments. In an applied case study, different instances of the class, including both established and newly introduced models, are applied to weekly case numbers of measles and mumps in Bavaria, Germany.</description>

      <title>Existence of a percolation threshold on finite transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(G_n)$ be a sequence of finite connected vertex-transitive graphs with volume tending to infinity. We say that a sequence of parameters $(p_n)$ is a percolation threshold if for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the proportion $\left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert$ of vertices contained in the largest cluster under bond percolation $\mathbb{P}_p^G$ satisfies both \[ \begin{split}
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_{(1+\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert \geq \alpha \right) &amp;= 1 \quad \text{for some $\alpha &gt; 0$, and}
  \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_{(1-\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \left\lVert K_1 \right\rVert \geq \alpha \right) &amp;= 0 \quad \text{for all $\alpha &gt; 0$}. \end{split}\] We prove that $(G_n)$ has a percolation threshold if and only if $(G_n)$ does not contain a particular infinite collection of pathological subsequences of dense graphs. Our argument uses an adaptation of Vanneuville's new proof of the sharpness of the phase transition for infinite graphs via couplings [Van22] together with our recent work with Hutchcroft on the uniqueness of the giant cluster [EH21].</description>

      <title>Tipsy cop and tipsy robber: collisions of biased random walks on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduced by Harris, Insko, Prieto Langarica, Stoisavljevic, and Sullivan, the \emph{tipsy cop and drunken robber} is a variant of the cop and robber game on graphs in which the robber simply moves randomly along the graph, while the cop moves directed towards the robber some fixed proportion of the time and randomly the remainder. In this article, we adopt a slightly different interpretation of tipsiness of the cop and robber where we assume that in any round of the game there are four possible outcomes: a sober cop move, a sober robber move, a tipsy (uniformly random) move by the cop, and a tipsy (uniformly random) move by the robber. We study this tipsy cop and tipsy robber game on the infinite grid graph and on certain families of infinite trees including $\delta$-regular trees %infinite binary trees with an infinite path rooted at every vertex, and $\delta$-regular trees rooted to a $\Delta$-regular tree, where $\Delta \geq \delta$. Our main results analyze strategies for the cop and robber on these graphs. We conclude with some directions for further study.</description>

      <title>Kinetically constrained models out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the full class of kinetically constrained models in arbitrary dimension and out of equilibrium, in the regime where the density $q$ of facilitating sites in the equilibrium measure (but not necessarily in the initial measure) is close to $1$. For these models, we establish exponential convergence to equilibrium in infinite volume and linear time precutoff in finite volume with appropriate boundary condition. Our results are the first out-of-equilibrium results that hold for any model in the so-called critical class, which is covered in its entirety by our treatment, including e.g. the Fredrickson-Andersen 2-spin facilitated model. In addition, they generalise, unify and sometimes simplify several previous works in the field. As byproduct, we recover and generalise exponential tails for the connected component of the origin in the upper invariant trajectory of perturbed cellular automata and in the set of eventually infected sites in subcritical bootstrap percolation models. Our approach goes through the study of cooperative contact processes, last passage percolation, Toom contours, as well as a very convenient coupling between contact processes and kinetically constrained models.</description>

      <title>Stationary fluctuations of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stationary fluctuations of independent run-and-tumble particles. We prove that the joint densities of particles with given internal state converges to an infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We also consider an interacting case, where the particles are subjected to exclusion. We then study the fluctuations of the total density, which is a non-Markovian Gaussian process, and obtain its covariance in closed form. By considering small noise limits of this non-Markovian Gaussian process, we obtain in a concrete example a large deviation rate function containing memory terms.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the site frequency spectrum of neutral mutations in an exponentially growing population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is a widely used summary statistic of genomic data. Motivated by recent evidence for the role of neutral evolution in cancer, we investigate the SFS of neutral mutations in an exponentially growing population. Using branching process techniques, we establish (first-order) almost sure convergence results for the SFS of a Galton-Watson process, evaluated either at a fixed time or at the stochastic time at which the population first reaches a certain size. We finally use our results to construct consistent estimators for the extinction probability and the effective mutation rate of a birth-death process.</description>

      <title>The phase transition for the Gaussian free field is sharp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the phase transition for the Gaussian free field (GFF) is sharp. In comparison to a previous argument due to Rodriguez in 2017 which characterized a $0-1$ law for the Massive Gaussian Free Field by analyzing crossing probabilities below a threshold $h_{**}$, we implement a strategy due to Duminil-Copin and Manolescu in 2016, which establishes that two parameters are equal, one of which encapsulates the probability of obtaining an infinite connected component under free boundary conditions, while the other encapsulates the natural logarithm of the probability of obtaining a connected component from the origin to the box of length $n$ which is also taken under free boundary conditions. We quantify the probability of obtaining crossings in easy and hard directions, without imposing conditions that the graph is invariant with respect to reflections, in addition to making use of a differential inequality adapted for the GFF. The sharpness of the phase transition is characterized by the fact that below a certain height parameter of the GFF, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster a.s. decays exponentially fast, while above the parameter, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster occurs a.s. with good probability.</description>

      <title>Overlap Times in Tandem Queues: Identically Distributed Station Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate overlap times in a two-dimensional infinite server tandem queue. Specifically, we analyze the amount of time that a pair of customers spend overlapping in any station of the two dimensional tandem network. We assume that both stations have independent and identically distributed exponential service times with the same rate parameter $\mu$. Our main contribution is the derivation of the joint tail distribution, the two marginal tail probabilities, the moments of the overlap times and the tail distribution of the sum of the overlap times in both stations. Our results shed light on how customers overlap downstream in serial queueing systems.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium strategies in time-inconsistent stochastic control problems with constraints: necessary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.01473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a time-inconsistent recursive stochastic control problems where the forward state process is constrained through an additional recursive utility system. By adapting the Ekeland variational principle, necessary conditions for equilibrium strategies are presented concerning a second-order Hamiltonian function defined by pairs of backward stochastic differential equations. At last, we consider a finite horizon state constrained investment-consumption problem with non-exponential actualisation as an example to show the application in finance. The class of constraints investigated here includes the possibility of imposing a risk bound on the terminal value of the wealth process.</description>

      <title>Takagi type functions and dynamical systems: the smoothness of the SBR measure and the existence and smoothness of local time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Takagi-type functions with roughness parameter $\gamma$ that are H\"older continuous with coefficient $H=\frac{\log\gamma}{\log \frac{1}{2}}.$ Analytical access is provided by an embedding into a dynamical system related to the baker transform where the graphs of the functions are identified as their global attractors. They possess stable manifolds hosting Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle (SBR) measures. We identify these measures with the laws of certain symmetric Bernoulli convolutions. Dually, where duality is related to ''time'' reversal, we give a representation of the Takagi-type curves centered around fibers of the associated stable manifold in terms of Bernoulli convolutions. Duality also relates SBR to occupation measure. As opposed to SBR measure - Bernoulli convolutions belong to the first chaos - occupation measure turns out to be a functional in the second Rademacher chaos, in terms of this non-Gaussian Malliavin calculus. Using a Fourier analytic criterion and variants of Weyl's equidistribution theorem, we prove for smoothness parameters $\gamma = 2^{-\frac{1}{m}}, m\in\mathbb{N},$ that the Takagi-type curves possess square integrable local times with $m-2$ smooth derivatives.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations for two-time scale systems with mixed fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on moderate deviations for two-time scale systems with mixed fractional Brownian motion. Our proof uses the weak convergence method which is based on the variational representation formula for mixed fractional Brownian motion. Throughout this paper, Hurst parameter of fractional Brownian motion is larger than $1/2$ and the integral along the fractional Brownian motion is understood as the generalized Riemann-Stieltjes integral. First, we consider single-time scale systems with fractional Brownian motion. The key of our proof is showing the weak convergence of the controlled system. Next, we extend our method to show moderate deviations for two-time scale systems. To this goal, we combine the Khasminskii-type averaging principle and the weak convergence approach.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian product inequality conjecture for disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends various results related to the Gaussian product inequality (GPI) conjecture to the setting of disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices. This includes product-type inequalities for matrix-variate analogs of completely monotone functions and Bernstein functions of Wishart disjoint principal minors, respectively. In particular, the product-type inequalities apply to inverse determinant powers. Quantitative versions of the inequalities are also obtained when there is a mix of positive and negative exponents. Furthermore, an extended form of the GPI is shown to hold for the eigenvalues of Wishart random matrices by virtue of their law being multivariate totally positive of order~2 ($\mathrm{MTP}_2$). A new, unexplored avenue of research is presented to study the GPI from the point of view of elliptical distributions.</description>
