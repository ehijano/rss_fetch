      <title>Flow Structures Beneath Stationary Waves with Constant Vorticity Over Variable Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow structures beneath waves have received significant attention from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Most studies on this topic assume a flat bottom, leading to questions about the effects of variable bottom topography. To address this gap, we investigate the flow structures beneath stationary waves with constant vorticity, considering the influence of variable topography. Specifically, we numerically analyze the role of vorticity in the emergence of stagnation points and the pressure distribution within the fluid in two bottom topography scenarios: a bump and a hole. Our numerical approach is based on a variation of the classical Dyachenko, Zakharov, and Kuznetsov conformal mapping technique for free-boundary water wave problems. Our results reveal the existence of saddle points beneath wave crests and center beneath depression solitary waves. Additionally, we observe that the pressure can exhibit distinctive features, such as a global minimum on the bottom boundary -- behavior that is markedly different from the usual flat-bottom case.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of the actuator line method for unsteady aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a linear theory for unsteady aerodynamic effects of the actuator line method (ALM). This theory is validated using ALM simulations, where we compute the lift generated by the harmonic transverse oscillation of a thin airfoil in uniform flow, comparing the results with Theodorsen's theory. This comparison elucidates the underlying characteristics and limitations of ALM when applied to unsteady aerodynamics. Numerical simulations were conducted across a range of chord lengths and oscillation frequencies. Comparison of ALM results with theoretical predictions shows consistent accuracy, with all Gaussian parameter choices yielding accurate results at low reduced frequencies. Furthermore, the study indicates that selecting a width parameter ratio of $\varepsilon/c$ (the Gaussian width parameter over the chord length) between 0.33 and 0.4 in ALM yields the closest alignment with analytical results across a broader frequency range. Additionally, a proper definition of angle of attack for a pitching airfoil is shown to be important for accurate computations. These findings offer valuable guidance for the application of ALM in unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.</description>

      <title>Consistent continuum equations and numerical benchmarks for a perturbation-based, variable-coefficient acoustofluidic solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a consistent continuum framework and a variable-coefficient acoustofluidic solver to analyze acoustic streaming. A perturbation approach is used to split the compressible Navier-Stokes equations into two sub-systems: a first-order harmonic system and a time-averaged second-order mean system. Prior acoustofluidic numerical studies have typically employed simplifying assumptions regarding the second-order mass balance equation and boundary conditions. These assumptions -- frequently left unjustified -- result in an incongruent problem statement where the boundary conditions are not consistent with the governing equations. To clarify these assumptions and mitigate the associated confusion, we systematically formulate the second-order mass balance equation into two analytically equivalent but numerically distinct forms by introducing the fluid's Lagrangian and mass transport velocity. We clarify the relation between these quantities to illustrate that a zero mass transport velocity does not necessarily imply a zero Lagrangian velocity. A second-order accurate finite difference/volume scheme is used to discretize the governing equations and boundary conditions expressed in Eulerian form. We solve the first-order coupled Helmholtz system via a sparse direct solver while the second-order system is solved via a Krylov (FGMRES) solver with a projection method-based preconditioner. To ascertain the spatial accuracy and consistency of numerical implementation of the split system of equations and boundary conditions, we demonstrate verification results and convergence rates using manufactured solutions. We provide benchmark test cases to demonstrate the impact of the choice of boundary conditions on second-order flow field. Lastly, we examine a system with spatially varying density to illustrate the difference in flow fields between constant and variable density systems.</description>

      <title>On the stability of viscous three-dimensional rotating Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of Couette flow in the 3d Navier-Stokes equations with rotation, as given by the Coriolis force. Hereby, the nature of linearized dynamics near Couette flow depends crucially on the force balance between background shearing and rotation, and includes lift-up or exponential instabilities, as well as a stable regime. In the latter, shearing resp. rotational inertial waves give rise to mixing and dispersive effects, which are relevant for distinct dynamical realms. Our main result quantifies these effects through enhanced dissipation and dispersive amplitude decay in both linear and nonlinear settings: in particular, we establish a nonlinear transition threshold which quantitatively improves over the setting without rotation (and increases further with rotation speed), showcasing its stabilizing effect.</description>

      <title>Bag breakup of low viscosity drops in the presence of a continuous air jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the breakup of a single drop of various low viscosity fluids as it deforms in the presence of continuous horizontal air jet. Such a fragmentation typically occurs after the bulk liquid has disintegrated upon exiting the atomizer and is in the form of an ensemble of drops which undergo further breakup. The drop deformation and its eventual disintegration is important in evaluating the efficacy of a particular industrial process, be it combustion in automobile engines or pesticide spraying in agricultural applications. The interplay between competing influences of surface tension and aerodynamic disruptive forces is represented by the Weber number, $We$, and Ohnesorge number, $Oh$, and used to describe the breakup morphology. The breakup pattern considered in our study corresponds to that of a bag attached to a toroidal ring which occurs from $12 &lt; We &lt; 16$. We aim to address several issues connected with this breakup process and their dependence on $We$ and $Oh$ which have been hitherto unexplored. The $We$ boundary at which breakup begins is theoretically determined and the expression obtained, $We = 12(1 + 2/3Oh^2)$, is found to match well with experimental data available in literature. An exponential growth in the radial extent of the deformed drop and the streamline dimension of the bag is predicted by a theoretical model and confirmed by experimental findings. These quantities are observed to strongly depend on $We$. However, their dependence on $Oh$ is weak.</description>

      <title>On dissipation time scales of the basic second-order moments: the effect on the Energy and Flux-Budget (EFB) turbulence closure for stably stratified turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dissipation rates of the basic second-order moments are the key parameters playing a vital role in turbulence modelling and controlling turbulence energetics and spectra and turbulent fluxes of momentum and heat. In this paper, we use the results of direct numerical simulations (DNSs) to evaluate dissipation rates of the basic second-order moments and revise the energy and flux budget (EFB) turbulence closure theory for stably stratified turbulence. We delve into the theoretical implications of this approach and substantiate our closure hypotheses through DNS data. We also show why the concept of down-gradient turbulent transport becomes incomplete when applied to the vertical turbulent flux of potential temperature under stable stratification. We reveal essential feedback between the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), the vertical turbulent flux of buoyancy, and the turbulent potential energy (TPE), which is responsible for maintaining shear-produced stably stratified turbulence for any Richardson number.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Methods with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Compressible Navier--Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational advances have fundamentally transformed the landscape of numerical simulations, enabling unprecedented levels of complexity and precision in modeling physical phenomena. While these high-fidelity simulations offer invaluable insights for scientific discovery and problem solving, they impose substantial computational requirements. Consequently, low-fidelity models augmented with subgrid-scale parameterizations are employed to achieve computational feasibility. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable framework for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This integrated approach combines a differentiable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver with a neural network source term. Through the implementation of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) for network parameter optimization, our methodology ensures continuous interaction with the governing equations throughout the training process. We refer to this approach as NODE-DG. This hybrid approach combines the accuracy of numerical methods with the efficiency of machine learning, offering the following key advantages: (1) enhanced accuracy of low-order DG approximations by capturing subgrid-scale dynamics; (2) robustness to nonuniform and missing temporal data; (3) elimination of operator-splitting errors; and (4) a continuous-in-time operator enabling predictions with variable time step sizes, which accelerates projected high-order DG simulations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework through two examples: two-dimensional Kelvin--Helmholtz instability and three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex examples.</description>

      <title>A deep-water closure model for surface waves on axisymmetric swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of linear gravity waves on the free surface of steady, axisymmetric flows with purely azimuthal velocity. We propose a two-dimensional set of governing equations for surface waves valid in the deep-water limit. These equations come from a closure condition at the free surface that reduces the three-dimensional Euler equations in the bulk of the fluid to a set of two-dimensional equations applied only at the free surface. Since the closure condition is not obtained rigorously, it is validated numerically through comparisons with full three-dimensional calculations for vortex flows, including for a Lamb-Oseen vortex. The model presented here overcomes three limitations of existing models, namely: it is not restricted to potential base flows; it does not assume the base flow to have a flat free surface; and it does not require the use of infinite-order differential operators (such as $\tanh(\nabla)$) in the governing equations. The model can be applied in the case of rapid swirl (large Froude number) where the base free surface is substantially deformed. Since the model contains only derivatives of finite order, it is readily amenable to standard numerical study.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the checkerboard problem to reduce numerical dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive exploration of various methods in solving incompressible flows using a projection method, and their relation to the occurrence and management of checkerboard oscillations. It employs an algebraic symmetry-preserving framework, clarifying the derivation and implementation of discrete operators while also addressing the associated numerical errors. The lack of a proper definition for the checkerboard problem is addressed by proposing a physics-based coefficient. This coefficient, rooted in the disparity between the compact- and wide-stencil Laplacian operators, is able to quantify oscillatory solution fields with a physics-based, global, normalised, non-dimensional value. The influence of mesh and time-step refinement on the occurrence of checkerboarding is highlighted. Therefore, single measurements using this coefficient should be considered with caution, as the value presents little use without any context and can either suggest mesh refinement or use of a different solver. In addition, an example is given on how to employ this coefficient, by establishing a negative feedback between the level of checkerboarding and the inclusion of a pressure predictor, to dynamically balance the checkerboarding and numerical dissipation. This method is tested for laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating its capabilities in obtaining this dynamical balance, without requiring user input. The method is able to achieve low numerical dissipation in absence of oscillations or diminish oscillation on skew meshes, while it shows minimal loss in accuracy for a turbulent test case. Despite its advantages, the method exhibits a slight decrease in the second-order relation between time-step size and pressure error, suggesting that other feedback mechanisms could be of interest.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Wavevector Model for Rapidly-Distorted Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic wavevector approach is formulated to accurately represent compressible turbulence subject to rapid deformations. This approach is inspired by the incompressible particle representation model of Kassinos (1995) and preserves the exact nature of compressible Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT). The adoption of a stochastic - rather than the Fourier - perspective simplifies the transformation of statistics to physical space and serves as a starting point for the development of practical turbulence models. We assume small density fluctuations and isentropic flow to obtain a transport equation for the pressure fluctuation. This results in five fewer transport equations compared to the compressible RDT model of Yu and Girimaji (2007). The final formulation is closed in spectral space and only requires numerical approximation for the transformation integrals. The use of Monte Carlo for unit wavevector integration motivates the representation of the moments as stochastic variables. Consistency between the Fourier and stochastic representation is demonstrated by showing equivalency between the evolution equations for the velocity spectrum tensor in both representations. Sample clustering with respect to orientation allows for different techniques to be used for the wavevector magnitude integration. The performance of the stochastic model is evaluated for axially-compressed turbulence, serving as a simplified model for shock-turbulence interaction, and is compared to LIA and DNS. Pure and compressed sheared turbulence at different distortion Mach numbers are also computed and compared to RDT/DNS data. Finally, two additional deformations are applied and compared to solenoidal and pressure-released limits to demonstrate the modeling capability for generic rapid deformations.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular approach to analyzing and modeling fluid flows. In practice, datasets are almost always corrupted to some degree by noise. The vanilla DMD is highly noise-sensitive, which is why many algorithmic extensions for improved robustness exist. We introduce a flexible optimization approach that merges available ideas for improved accuracy and robustness. The approach simultaneously identifies coherent dynamics and noise in the data. In tests on the laminar flow past a cylinder, the method displays strong noise robustness and high levels of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Comparing temporal and aggregated network descriptions of fluid transport in the Mediterranean Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean currents exhibit strong time dependence at all scales that influences physical and biochemical dynamics. Network approaches to fluid transport permit to address explicitly how connectivity across the seascape is affected by the spatiotemporal variability of currents. However, such temporal aspect is mostly neglected, relying on a static representation of the flow. We here investigate the role of current variability on networks describing physical transport across the Mediterranean basin. We first focus on degree distributions and community structure comparing ensembles of temporal networks that explicitly resolve time dependence and their aggregated, i.e. time-averaged, counterparts. Furthermore, we explore the implications of the two approaches in a simple reaction dispersal model for a generic tracer. Our analysis evidences that aggregation induces structural network changes that cannot be easily avoided, not even introducing a pruning of the aggregated adjacency matrix. We also highlight that, depending on the time scales considered, the importance of the temporal features of the networks can vary significantly. Finally, we find that the tracer evolution obtained from a temporal dispersal kernel cannot be always approximated by aggregated adjacency matrices, in particular during transients of the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in (Igor Loutsenko, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1309, 2004). Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Advection-Diffusion Equation by Direct Block Encoding of the Time-Marching Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for simulating multidimensional scalar transport problems using a time-marching strategy is presented. A direct unitary block encoding of the explicit time-marching operator is constructed, resulting in the intrinsic success probability of the squared solution norm without the need for amplitude amplification, thereby retaining a linear dependence on the simulation time. The algorithm separates the explicit time-marching operator into an advection-like component and a corrective shift operator. The advection-like component is mapped to a Hamiltonian simulation and combined with the shift operator through the linear combination of unitaries algorithm. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a steady two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex support the theoretical findings.</description>
