      <title>Towards Open-Closed Categorical Enumerative Invariants: Circle-Action Formality Morphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Categorical enumerative invariants of a Calabi-Yau category, encoded as the partition function of the associated closed string field theory (SFT), conjecturally equal Gromov-Witten invariants when applied to Fukaya categories. Part of this theory is a formality $L_\infty$ morphism which depends on a splitting of the non-commutative Hodge filtration. Our main result is providing an open-closed formality morphism; the algebraic structures involved conjecturallygive a home to open-closed GW invariants. We explain how the open-closed morphism is an ingredient towards quantizing the large $N$ open SFT of an object of a Calabi-Yau category.</description>

      <title>Seven Sphere Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-oriented contact manifolds quite generally describe classical dynamical systems. Quantization is achieved by suitably associating a Schr\"odinger equation to every path in the contact manifold. We quantize the standard contact seven sphere by treating it as a homogeneous space of the quaternionic unitary group in order to construct a contact analog of Fedosov's formal connection on symplectic spinor bundles. We show that requiring convergence of the formal connection naturally filters the symplectic spinor bundle and yields an exact flat connection on each corresponding subbundle. A key ingredient is a generalization of the Holstein--Primakoff mechanism to the quaternionic unitary group. The passage from formal to bona fide quantization determines unitary irreducible representations of the quaternionic unitary group, whose dimensions tend to infinity as the formal deformation parameter approaches its classical limit. This appearance of finite-dimensional representations is not surprising since the contact seven sphere is closed and physically describes generalized positions, momenta and time variables.</description>

      <title>$Q$-operators, $q$-opers, and R-matrices in 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantization of the moduli space of multiplicative Higgs bundles through the lens of five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in $\Omega$-background. We extend the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theoretical construction of key geometric and representation-theoretic structures, established in earlier works, to the five-dimensional uplift. We construct and analyze the $Q$-operators and $q$-opers associated with the canonical codimension-two defect: the $Q$-operators are defined via the insertion of the defect, while the $q$-opers arise as the $q$-difference chiral ring equations in its presence. The $q$-oper difference equations are further identified with the Baxter TQ equations for XXZ spin chains constructed from tensor products of bi-infinite evaluation modules over quantum affine algebras of type ${\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$. We define a $q$-difference module structure on the space of monodromy codimension-two defect partition functions and show that the eigenstates of the $Q$-operators, constructed from monodromy defects, simultaneously diagonalize the quantum Hamiltonians of the XXZ spin chain. A Fourier transformation exchanges the $Q$-operators associated with two XXZ spin chains bispectral dual to each other. Finally, we relate these constructions to the quantum cluster algebra arising from the BPS quiver of the 5d theory, and re-express the R-matrices in terms of the cluster variables.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Directed Quantum Graphs on M2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Gromada and Matsuda classified undirected quantum graphs on the matrix algebra $M_2$. Later, Wasilweski provided a solid theory of directed quantum graphs which was formerly only established for undirected quantum graphs. Using this framework we extend the results of Matsuda and Gromada, and present a complete classification of directed quantum graphs on $M_2$. Most prominently, we observe that there is a far bigger range of directed quantum graphs than of undirected quantum graphs on $M_2$. Moreover, for quantum graphs on a nontracial quantum set $(M_2, \psi)$ we illustrate the difference between GNS- and KMS-undirected quantum graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a finite 2-group. We show that the 2-category $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{G})$ of finite semisimple 2-representations is a symmetric fusion 2-category. We also relate the auto-equivalence 2-group of the symmetric monoidal forgetful 2-functor $\omega : 2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{G}) \to 2\mathrm{Vec}$ to the auto-equivalence 2-group of the regular algebra and show that they are equivalent to $\mathcal{G}$. This result categorifies the usual Tannaka-Krein duality for finite groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Hopf algebroids to formulate a notion of a noncommutative and non-cocommutative Hopf 2-algebra. We show how these arise from a bicrossproduct Hopf algebra with Peiffer identities. In particular, we show that for a Hopf algebra $H$ with bijective antipode, the mirror bicrossproduct Hopf algebra $H\triangleright\!\!\!\blacktriangleleft H_{cop}$ is a Hopf 2-algebra. We apply the theorem on Sweedler's Hopf algebra as an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</description>

      <title>On the simplicity of the tensor product of two simple modules of quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lapid and M\'{i}nguez gave a criterion of the irreducibility of the parabolic induction $\sigma \times \pi$, where $\sigma$ is a ladder representation and $\pi$ is an arbitrary irreducible representation of the general linear group over a non-archimedean field. Through quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality, when $k$ is large enough, this gives a criterion of the irreducibility of the tensor product of a snake module $L(M)$ and any simple module $L(N)$ of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_k})$. The goal of this paper is to add conditions to their criterion such that it works for any $k \geq 1$. We prove the criterion in the case where both modules are snake modules or one of them is a fundamental module at an extremity node and the other is any simple module. We also defined a similar criterion in the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathrm{Gr}(k,n, \sim)]$, and show that for any $k \geq 1$, two ladders are compatible if and only if the corresponding tableaux satisfy the criterion. This generalizes Leclerc and Zelevinsky's result that two Pl\"{u}cker coordinates are compatible if and only if they are weakly separated.</description>

      <title>The 2-character theory of finite 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the notion of character for 2-representations of finite 2-groups. The properties of 2-characters bear strong similarities to those classical characters of finite groups, including conjugation invariance, additivity, multiplicativity and orthogonality. With a careful analysis using homotopy fixed points and quotients for categories with 2-group actions, we prove that the category of class functors on a 2-group $\mathcal G$ is equivalent to the Drinfeld center of the 2-group algebra $\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G}$, which categorifies the Fourier transform on finite abelian groups. After transferring the canonical nondegenerate braided monoidal structure from $\mathfrak Z_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G})$, we discover that irreducible 2-characters of $\mathcal G$ coincide with full centers of the corresponding 2-representations, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with Lagrangian algebras in the category of class functors on $\mathcal G$. In particular, the fusion rule of $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal G)$ can be calculated from the pointwise product of Lagrangian algebras as class functors. From a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) point of view, the commutative Frobenius algebra structure on a 2-character is induced from a 2D topological sigma-model with target space $\lvert \mathrm{B} \mathcal G \rvert$.</description>

      <title>Anti-pre-Novikov algebras, quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Firstly, we introduce a notion of anti-pre-Novikov algebras as a new framework for decomposing Novikov algebras. Anti-O-operators on Novikov algebras are developed to provide an algebraic framework for constructing anti-pre-Novikov algebras. Secondly, we introduce a notion of anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as the bialgebra structures corresponding to a double construction of symmetric quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras, which is characterized by certain matched pairs of Novikov algebras as well as the compatible anti-pre-Novikov algebras. The study of the coboundary case induces the anti-pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation (APN-YBE), whose skew-symmetric solutions yield coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The notion of O-operators on anti-pre-Novikov algebras is studied to construct skew-symmetric solutions of the APN-YBE. Thirdly, we investigate quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as a special class of coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The solutions of the APN-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant give rise to a quasi-triangular anti-pre-Novikov bialgebra. Moreover, relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights are introduced to demonstrate solutions of the APN-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant. Finally, we introduce a notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-pre-Novikov algebras, which is one to one correspondence to a factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Good involutions of conjugation subquandles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutive symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>
