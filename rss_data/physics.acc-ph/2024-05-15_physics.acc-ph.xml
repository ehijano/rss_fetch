      <title>Application of Stochastic Control Algorithms for the Improvement of the Electron Injection Efficiency of BESSY II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron light source storage rings aim to maintain a continuous beam current without observable beam motion during injection. One element that paves the way to this target is the non-linear kicker (NLK). The field distribution it generates poses challenges for optimising the topping-up operation. Within this study, a reinforcement learning agent was developed and trained to optimise the NLK operation parameters. We present the models employed, the optimisation process, and the achieved results.</description>

      <title>Design and commissioning of a high-level control system for a medical isochronous cyclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MEDICYC (MEDical CYClotron) is an isochronous cyclotron dedicated to radiotherapy which was built and commissioned in Nice, France, in 1990 by a local team aided by experts from CERN. The cyclotron accelerates negative H to a maximum energy of 65 MeV and uses stripping to extract a proton beam. Its primary purpose is treating ocular melanoma by protontherapy but a significant research activity is also present on beam-lines dedicated for this purpose. An extensive refurbishment program of the cyclotron has been started to cope with the end-of-life and/or the obsolescence of several sub-systems. In this context, a new high-level cyclotron control system has been developed and commissioned in 2021-2024. The primary responsibility of the system is the high-level coordination of the source, the RF system, the beam-line and cyclotron magnets, to produce and deliver a beam with a given set of characteristics. A secondary responsibility is the collection, visualization and analysis of sub-system and beam data for monitoring and pre-emptive fault detection. In this contribution, the control system software architecture is presented and the infrastructure on which the systems are deployed is laid out.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Human-Machine Collaborative Particle Accelerator Tuning through Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous tuning of particle accelerators is an active and challenging field of research with the goal of enabling novel accelerator technologies cutting-edge high-impact applications, such as physics discovery, cancer research and material sciences. A key challenge with autonomous accelerator tuning remains that the most capable algorithms require an expert in optimisation, machine learning or a similar field to implement the algorithm for every new tuning task. In this work, we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to tune particle accelerators. We demonstrate on a proof-of-principle example the ability of LLMs to successfully and autonomously tune a particle accelerator subsystem based on nothing more than a natural language prompt from the operator, and compare the performance of our LLM-based solution to state-of-the-art optimisation algorithms, such as Bayesian optimisation (BO) and reinforcement learning-trained optimisation (RLO). In doing so, we also show how LLMs can perform numerical optimisation of a highly non-linear real-world objective function. Ultimately, this work represents yet another complex task that LLMs are capable of solving and promises to help accelerate the deployment of autonomous tuning algorithms to the day-to-day operations of particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Review of the high-power vacuum tube microwave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.04288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the first vacuum tube (X-ray tube) was invented by Wilhelm R\"ontgen in Germany, after more than one hundred years of development, the average power density of the vacuum tube microwave source has reached the order of 108 [MW][GHz]2. The maximum power density record was created by the Free Electron Lasers. In the high-power microwave field, the vacuum devices are still the mainstream microwave sources for applications such as scientific instruments, communications, radars, magnetic confinement fusion heating, microwave weapons, etc. The principles of microwave generation by vacuum tube microwave sources include Cherenkov or Smith-Purcell radiation, transition radiation, and Bremsstrahlung. In this paper, the vacuum tube microwave sources were reviewed in order according to the three radiation principles. Among them, the Vircators can produce 22 GW output power in P-band (0.23-1GHz). Vacuum tubes that can achieve continuous-wave operation include Traveling Wave Tubes, Klystrons, Free Electron Lasers, and Magnetrons, with output power up to 1MW. Vacuum tubes that can generate frequencies of the order of 100 GHz and above include Klystrons, Traveling Wave Tubes, Gyrotrons, Backward Wave Oscillators, Magnetrons, Surface Wave Oscillators, Free Electron Lasers, Orotrons, etc. Gyrotrons are very attractive in the millimeter wave and THz fields. The Gyrotrons can output power at the MW level with 3000s pulse width at millimeter wavelengths.</description>
