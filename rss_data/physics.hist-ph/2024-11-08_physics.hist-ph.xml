      <title>Enaction for QBists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper began as a set of notes introducing quantum physicists of the QBist persuasion to enactive theory. Unlike mainstream cognitive science, which views cognition as computations on internal representations of the external world (and thus the mind as in the head), the enactive approach sees cognition as adaptive, embodied action. Enaction can ground concepts of experience, agency, knowledge, and normativity - which play key roles in QBist quantum mechanics - in terms consistent with QBism's participatory approach. That's because QBism and enaction both reject an absolute, pregiven subject-object split: for QBism, quantum measurement is the enactment of the subject-object divide; for enaction, cognition is the enactment of that divide. Indeed, each appears to be half of the same story. QBism is a theory of how the world is created and recreated through interactions with an agent, while enaction is a theory of how agents are created and recreated through interactions with the world. Through conversations with QBists and enactivists, these notes evolved into a larger project aimed at unifying QBist physics with enactive cognitive science. Taken together, they offer the possibility of a unified metaphysics - one that brings subject and object, mind and world, back together again.</description>
