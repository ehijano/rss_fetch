      <title>How many crossing changes or Delta-moves does it take to get to a homotopy trivial link?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homotopy trivializing number, \(n_h(L)\), and the Delta homotopy trivializing number, \(n_\Delta(L)\), are invariants of the link homotopy class of \(L\) which count how many crossing changes or Delta moves are needed to reduce that link to a homotopy trivial link. In 2022, Davis, Orson, and Park proved that the homotopy trivializing number of \(L\) is bounded above by the sum of the absolute values of the pairwise linking numbers and some quantity \(C_n\) which depends only on \(n\), the number of components. In this paper we improve on this result by using the classification of link homotopy due to Habegger-Lin to give a quadratic upper bound on \(C_n\). We employ ideas from extremal graph theory to demonstrate that this bound is close to sharp, by exhibiting links with vanishing pairwise linking numbers and whose homotopy trivializing numbers grows quadratically. In the process, we determine the homotopy trivializing number of every 4-component link. We also prove a cubic upper bound on the difference between the Delta homotopy trivializing number of \(L\) and the sum of the absolute values of the triple linking numbers of \(L\).</description>

      <title>Combinatorial formula for the $M$ invariant of magnetic lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To solve MHD problems within the framework of the theory of two-scale mean fields, it is important to study the invariants of magnetic lines. Such invariants are constructed on the basis of invariants of classical links, which must satisfy the asymptotic property. We choose the simplest asymptotic invariant $M_3$ of three-component links, which is not expressed in terms of the pairwise linking coefficients of the components. We check the asymptotic property based only on the combinatorial definition of the invariant and do not use the analytic integral. For simple examples, the proven formula is verified by calculation.</description>

      <title>Direct and indirect constructions of locally flat surfaces in 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two main approaches to building locally flat embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds: direct methods which geometrically manipulate a given map of a surface, and more indirect methods using surgery theory. Both methods rely on Freedman--Quinn's disc embedding theorem. These are the lecture notes for a minicourse giving an introduction to both methods, by sketching the proofs of the following results: every primitive second homology class in a closed, simply connected 4-manifold is represented by a locally flat torus (Lee--Wilczy\'{n}ski); and every Alexander polynomial one knot in $S^3$ is topologically slice (Freedman--Quinn).</description>

      <title>Patterns of Geodesics, Shearing, and Anosov Representations of the Modular Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. Let $\cal DFR$ be the space of discrete faithful representations of the modular group into ${\rm Isom\/}(X)$ which map the order $2$ generator to a point reflection. I prove that the Barbot component $\cal B$ of $\cal DFR$ is homeomorphic $\R^2 \times [0,\infty)$, that $\partial \cal B$ parametrizes the Pappus representations from [{\bf S0\/}], and that ${\cal B\/}-\partial {\cal B\/}$ parametrizes the complete extension of the family of Anosov representations defined in [{\bf BLV\/}]. I prove that the members of $\cal B$ are isometry groups of patterns of geodesics in $X$. The {\it Farey patterns\/} preserved by the Pappus representations have asymptotic properties like the geodesics in the Farey triangulation. The {\it Anosov patterns\/} are obtained from the Farey patterns by either of two shearing operations. The shearing structure is encoded by a pair of $1$-dimensional foliations of $\cal B$.</description>

      <title>Qusimorphisms on the group of density preserving diffeomorphisms of the M\"{o}bius band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of quasimorphisms on groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds has been extensively studied under various regularity conditions, such as smooth, volume-preserving, and symplectic. However, in this context, nothing is known about groups of `area'-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of groups of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on non-orientable manifolds.
  Here, the density is a natural concept that generalizes volume without concerning orientability. We show that the group of density-preserving diffeomorphisms on the M\"obius band admits countably many unbounded quasimorphisms which are linearly independent. Along the proof, we show that groups of density preserving diffeomorphisms on compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces with non-empty boundary are weakly contractible.</description>

      <title>Curves on the torus with few intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aougab and Gaster [Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 174 (2023), 569--584] proved that any set of simple closed curves on the torus, where any two are non-homotopic and intersect at most $k$ times, has a maximum size of $k+O(\sqrt{k}\log k)$. We prove the maximum size of such a set is at most $k+O(1)$ and determine the exact maximum size for all sufficiently large $k$. In particular, we show that the maximum does not exceed $k+4$ when $k$ is large.</description>

      <title>A chain-level model for Chas-Sullivan products in Morse homology with differential graded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of Morse theory with differential graded coefficients to study certain operations on the total space of a fibration. More particularly, we focus in this paper on a chain-level description of the Chas-Sullivan product on the homology of the free loop space of an oriented, closed and connected manifold. The idea of ''intersecting on the base'' and ''concatenating on the fiber'' are well-adapted to this framework. We also give a Morse theoretical description of other products that follow the same principle. For this purpose, we develop functorial properties with respect to the coefficient in terms of morphisms of A $\infty$ -modules and morphisms of fibrations. We also build a differential graded version of the K{\"u}nneth formula and of the Pontryagin-Thom construction.</description>

      <title>A new way to prove configuration reducibility using gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how ideas coming out of gauge theory can be used to prove configurations in the list of ``633 unavoidable configurations" are reducible. In this paper, we prove the smallest nontrivial example, the Birkhoff diamond, is reducible using our filtered $3$- and $4$-color homology. This is a new proof of a 111-year-old result that is a direct consequence of a special (2+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theory. As part of the proof, we introduce the idea of a state-reducible configuration. Because state-reducibility does not involve Kempe switches, this leads to an independent way to verify the proof of the four color theorem. We conjecture that these gauge theoretic ideas could also lead to a non-computer-based proof of it.</description>

      <title>Manturov Projection for Virtual Legendrian Knots in $ST^*F$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kauffman virtual knots are knots in thickened surfaces $F\times R$ considered up to isotopy, stabilizations and destabilizations, and diffeomorphisms of $F\times R$ induced by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $F$. Similarly, virtual Legendrian knots, introduced by Cahn and Levi~\cite{CahnLevi}, are Legendrian knots in $ST^*F$ with the natural contact structure. Virtual Legendrian knots are considered up to isotopy, stabilization and destabilization of the surface away from the front projection of the Legendrian knot, as well as up to contact isomorphisms of $ST^*F$ induced by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $F$.
  We show that there is a projection operation $proj$ from the set of virtual isotopy classes of Legendrian knots to the set of isotopy classes of Legendrian knots in $ST^*S^2$. This projection is obtained by substituting some of the classical crossings of the front diagram for a virtual crossing. It restricts to the identity map on the set of virtual isotopy classes of classical Legendrian knots. In particular, the projection $proj$ extends invariants of Legendrian knots to invariants of virtual Legendrian knots. Using the projection $proj$, we show that the virtual crossing number of every classical Legendrian knot equals its crossing number. We also prove that the virtual canonical genus of a Legendrian knot is equal to the canonical genus.
  The construction of $proj$ is inspired by the work of Manturov.</description>

      <title>Geometry and topology of closed geodesics complements in the 3-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for at most three closed geodesics with linearly independent directions, the homeomorphism type of its complement in the 3-torus is determine by the orbit of their direction vectors subspaces under the action of $PSL_3(\mathbb{Z}).$ Moreover, we provide asymptotically sharp volume bounds for a family of closed geodesics complements. The bounds depend only on the distance in the Farey graph.</description>
