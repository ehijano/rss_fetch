      <title>3DMambaIPF: A State Space Model for Iterative Point Cloud Filtering via Differentiable Rendering</title>

Abstract: Noise is an inevitable aspect of point cloud acquisition, necessitating filtering as a fundamental task within the realm of 3D vision. Existing learning-based filtering methods have shown promising capabilities on small-scale synthetic or real-world datasets. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these methods is constrained when dealing with a substantial quantity of point clouds. This limitation primarily stems from their limited denoising capabilities for large-scale point clouds and their inclination to generate noisy outliers after denoising. The recent introduction of State Space Models (SSMs) for long sequence modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP) presents a promising solution for handling large-scale data. Encouraged by iterative point cloud filtering methods, we introduce 3DMambaIPF, firstly incorporating Mamba (Selective SSM) architecture to sequentially handle extensive point clouds from large scenes, capitalizing on its strengths in selective input processing and long sequence modeling capabilities. Additionally, we integrate a robust and fast differentiable rendering loss to constrain the noisy points around the surface. In contrast to previous methodologies, this differentiable rendering loss enhances the visual realism of denoised geometric structures and aligns point cloud boundaries more closely with those observed in real-world objects. Extensive evaluation on datasets comprising small-scale synthetic and real-world models (typically with up to 50K points) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we showcase the superior scalability and efficiency of our method on large-scale models with about 500K points, where the majority of the existing learning-based denoising methods are unable to handle.</description>

      <title>Rendering-Oriented 3D Point Cloud Attribute Compression using Sparse Tensor-based Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of 3D visualization techniques has fundamentally transformed how we interact with digital content. At the forefront of this change is point cloud technology, offering an immersive experience that surpasses traditional 2D representations. However, the massive data size of point clouds presents significant challenges in data compression. Current methods for lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) generally focus on reconstructing the original point clouds with minimal error. However, for point cloud visualization scenarios, the reconstructed point clouds with distortion still need to undergo a complex rendering process, which affects the final user-perceived quality. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates PCAC with differentiable rendering, denoted as rendering-oriented PCAC (RO-PCAC), directly targeting the quality of rendered multiview images for viewing. In a differentiable manner, the impact of the rendering process on the reconstructed point clouds is taken into account. Moreover, we characterize point clouds as sparse tensors and propose a sparse tensor-based transformer, called SP-Trans. By aligning with the local density of the point cloud and utilizing an enhanced local attention mechanism, SP-Trans captures the intricate relationships within the point cloud, further improving feature analysis and synthesis within the framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RO-PCAC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance, compared to existing reconstruction-oriented methods, including traditional, learning-based, and hybrid methods.</description>

      <title>OneLLM: One Framework to Align All Modalities with Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their strong multimodal understanding capability. However, existing works rely heavily on modality-specific encoders, which usually differ in architecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper, we present OneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified framework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and a progressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail, we first train an image projection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then, we build a universal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modules and dynamic routing. Finally, we progressively align more modalities to LLM with the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in following instructions, we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset, including 2M items from image, audio, video, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU and fMRI brain activity. OneLLM is evaluated on 25 diverse benchmarks, encompassing tasks such as multimodal captioning, question answering and reasoning, where it delivers excellent performance.
