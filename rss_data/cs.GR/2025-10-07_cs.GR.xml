      <title>Creative synthesis of kinematic mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the problem of kinematic synthesis for planar linkages as a cross-domain image generation task. We develop a planar linkages dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework.</description>

      <title>Universal Beta Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

      <title>Style Brush: Guided Style Transfer for 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Style Brush, a novel style transfer method for textured meshes designed to empower artists with fine-grained control over the stylization process. Our approach extends traditional 3D style transfer methods by introducing a novel loss function that captures style directionality, supports multiple style images or portions thereof, and enables smooth transitions between styles in the synthesized texture. The use of easily generated guiding textures streamlines user interaction, making our approach accessible to a broad audience. Extensive evaluations with various meshes, style images, and contour shapes demonstrate the flexibility of our method and showcase the visual appeal of the generated textures.</description>

      <title>Paris: A Decentralized Trained Open-Weight Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.</description>

      <title>Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03597v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

      <title>Diverse Text-to-Image Generation via Contrastive Noise Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.</description>

      <title>Joint Neural SDF Reconstruction and Semantic Segmentation for CAD Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple, data-efficient pipeline that augments an implicit reconstruction network based on neural SDF-based CAD parts with a part-segmentation head trained under PartField-generated supervision. Unlike methods tied to fixed taxonomies, our model accepts meshes with any number of parts and produces coherent, geometry-aligned labels in a single pass. We evaluate on randomly sampled CAD meshes from the ABC dataset with intentionally varied part cardinalities, including over-segmented shapes, and report strong performance across reconstruction (CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC) and segmentation (mIoU, Accuracy), together with a new Segmentation Consistency metric that captures local label smoothness. We attach a lightweight segmentation head to the Flat-CAD SDF trunk; on a paired evaluation it does not alter reconstruction while providing accurate part labels for meshes with any number of parts. Even under degraded reconstructions on thin or intricate geometries, segmentation remains accurate and label-coherent, often preserving the correct part count. Our approach therefore offers a practical route to semantically structured CAD meshes without requiring curated taxonomies or exact palette matches. We discuss limitations in boundary precision, partly due to per-face supervision, and outline paths toward boundary-aware training and higher resolution labels.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Foveated Rendering with Weighted Reservoir Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal sensitivity to high frequency information declines with increased peripheral eccentricity. Foveated rendering exploits this by decreasing the spatial resolution of rendered images in peripheral vision, reducing the rendering cost by omitting high frequency details. As foveation levels increase, the rendering quality is reduced, and traditional foveated rendering systems tend not to preserve samples that were previously rendered at high spatial resolution in previous frames. Additionally, prior research has shown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location rather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes perform small microsaccades around a fixation point. This creates an opportunity for sampling from temporally neighbouring frames with differing foveal locations to reduce the required rendered size of the foveal region while achieving a higher perceived image quality. We further observe that the temporal presentation of pixels frame-to-frame can be viewed as a data stream, presenting a random sampling problem. Following this intuition, we propose a Weighted Reservoir Sampling technique to efficiently maintain a reservoir of the perceptually relevant high quality pixel samples from previous frames and incorporate them into the computation of the current frame. This allows the renderer to render a smaller region of foveal pixels per frame by temporally reusing pixel samples that are still relevant to reconstruct a higher perceived image quality, while allowing for higher levels of foveation. Our method operates on the output of foveated rendering, and runs in under 1\,ms at 4K resolution, making it highly efficient and integrable with real-time VR and AR foveated rendering systems.</description>

      <title>3Dify: a Framework for Procedural 3D-CG Generation Assisted by LLMs Using MCP and RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes "3Dify," a procedural 3D computer graphics (3D-CG) generation framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.</description>

      <title>C3Editor: Achieving Controllable Consistency in 2D Model for 3D Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing 2D-lifting-based 3D editing methods often encounter challenges related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views. To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent 2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Social Agent: Mastering Dyadic Nonverbal Behavior Generation via Conversational LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Social Agent, a novel framework for synthesizing realistic and contextually appropriate co-speech nonverbal behaviors in dyadic conversations. In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized nonverbal behaviors.</description>

      <title>Bridging Text and Video Generation: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation technology holds potential to transform multiple domains such as education, marketing, entertainment, and assistive technologies for individuals with visual or reading comprehension challenges, by creating coherent visual content from natural language prompts. From its inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency. Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs, and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V research and applications.</description>

      <title>SAEdit: Token-level control for continuous image editing via Sparse AutoEncoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.</description>

      <title>Pulp Motion: Framing-aware multimodal camera and human motion generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treating human motion and camera trajectory generation separately overlooks a core principle of cinematography: the tight interplay between actor performance and camera work in the screen space. In this paper, we are the first to cast this task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent on-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked, modalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple, model-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary modality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the camera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between modalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint distribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent space, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera latents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which exploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing modality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a human-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality human motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures show the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame coherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment for both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically meaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task.

      <title>Textured Gaussians for Enhanced 3D Scene Appearance Modeling</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor. Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with 3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity. We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower number of Gaussians.</description>

      <title>CHOICE: Coordinated Human-Object Interaction in Cluttered Environments for Pick-and-Place Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animating human-scene interactions such as pick-and-place tasks in cluttered, complex layouts is a challenging task, with objects of a wide variation of geometries and articulation under scenarios with various obstacles. The main difficulty lies in the sparsity of the motion data compared to the wide variation of the objects and environments as well as the poor availability of transition motions between different tasks, increasing the complexity of the generalization to arbitrary conditions. To cope with this issue, we develop a system that tackles the interaction synthesis problem as a hierarchical goal-driven task. Firstly, we develop a bimanual scheduler that plans a set of keyframes for simultaneously controlling the two hands to efficiently achieve the pick-and-place task from an abstract goal signal such as the target object selected by the user. Next, we develop a neural implicit planner that generates guidance hand trajectories under diverse object shape/types and obstacle layouts. Finally, we propose a linear dynamic model for our DeepPhase controller that incorporates a Kalman filter to enable smooth transitions in the frequency domain, resulting in a more realistic and effective multi-objective control of the character.Our system can produce a wide range of natural pick-and-place movements with respect to the geometry of objects, the articulation of containers and the layout of the objects in the scene.</description>

      <title>ProcTex: Consistent and Interactive Text-to-texture Synthesis for Part-based Procedural Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have driven significant progress in text-guided texture synthesis. However, current methods focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D object, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter configurations at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for part-based procedural models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural modeling. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to synthesize texture for a template shape from the procedural model, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other procedural shapes via solving dense correspondence. To ensure interactiveness, we propose a novel correspondence network and show that dense correspondence can be effectively learned by a neural network for procedural models. We also develop several techniques, including a retexturing pipeline to support structural variation from procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting interactive applications.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Motion Imitation with Adversarial Differential Discriminators</title>

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, are prevalent across numerous applications. Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually-tuned aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization objective. The performance of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking methods for physically simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain expertise and significant manual tuning, but also limit the applicability of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective reinforcement-learning tasks, including motion tracking. Our proposed Adversarial Differential Discriminator (ADD) receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying on manually-designed reward functions.

      <title>Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</description>

      <title>WonderHuman: Hallucinating Unseen Parts in Dynamic 3D Human Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present WonderHuman to reconstruct dynamic human avatars from a monocular video for high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Previous dynamic human avatar reconstruction methods typically require the input video to have full coverage of the observed human body. However, in daily practice, one typically has access to limited viewpoints, such as monocular front-view videos, making it a cumbersome task for previous methods to reconstruct the unseen parts of the human avatar. To tackle the issue, we present WonderHuman, which leverages 2D generative diffusion model priors to achieve high-quality, photorealistic reconstructions of dynamic human avatars from monocular videos, including accurate rendering of unseen body parts. Our approach introduces a Dual-Space Optimization technique, applying Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in both canonical and observation spaces to ensure visual consistency and enhance realism in dynamic human reconstruction. Additionally, we present a View Selection strategy and Pose Feature Injection to enforce the consistency between SDS predictions and observed data, ensuring pose-dependent effects and higher fidelity in the reconstructed avatar. In the experiments, our method achieves SOTA performance in producing photorealistic renderings from the given monocular video, particularly for those challenging unseen parts.

      <title>TCDiff++: An End-to-end Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion Model for Harmonious Music-Driven Group Choreography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to encode temporal and identity information. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.</description>
