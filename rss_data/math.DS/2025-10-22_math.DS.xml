      <title>Topological dynamics for the endograph metric I: Equivalences with other metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ we investigate several topological dynamical properties for its Zadeh extension $(\mathcal{F}(X),\hat{f})$ endowed with the endograph metric $d_{E}$. In particular, we prove that for topological $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity, topological $(\ell,\mathcal{A})$-recurrence, Devaney chaos, and for the specification property, the endograph metric behaves similarly to the supremum metric $d_{\infty}$, the Skorokhod metric $d_{0}$ and the sendograph metric $d_{S}$. Our results not only resolve certain open questions in the existing literature, but also yield completely new outcomes in terms of point-$\mathcal{A}$-transitivity.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Stochastic Assessment of Dynamic N-1 Grid Contingencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system operators need tools for rapid, real-time counterfactual assessments of grid security under fast-changing conditions. Traditional N-1 contingency analysis lacks dynamic evaluation, especially of frequency swings from common faults. This paper introduces a real-time dashboard framework to screen dynamic contingencies. It assumes: (a) the grid starts in a balanced state; (b) faults can occur randomly on any transmission line, temporarily de-energizing and then reconnecting it within about one second; and (c) contingencies are flagged if post-fault transients cause line flows to exceed safety thresholds. The key contributions are: (1) Overload Indicator: a system-wide metric quantifying integrated N-1 dynamic risk from a given state; (2) Scalable Fault Evaluation Algorithm: a linear-scaling method to assess dynamic fault impacts without brute-force simulations; and (3) Risk Estimation: a Cross Entropy Adaptive Importance Sampling method estimating the likelihood of low probability by high risk events, e.g. associated with potential transformer over-current. We demonstrate the framework on the Israeli transmission power grid (IG).</description>

      <title>Attractors for the Wave Equation with Nonlinear Energy Critical Sources and Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave equation with energy-critical nonlinear sources and dissipation in 3 D is considered. It is shown that the resulting dynamical system admits a global attractor. Under the additional assumption of strong monotonicity of the damping at the origin, the said attractor is also finite dimensional and smooth. In order to handle \enquote{energy criticality} of both sources and the damping, the methods used depend on enhanced dissipation \cite{Bociu-lasiecka-jde}, energy {\it identity} for weak solutions \cite{Koch-lasiecka}, an adaptation of Ball's method \cite{ball}, and the theory of quasi-stable systems \cite{chueshov-white}.</description>

      <title>Wiener--Wintner points for topological dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider measurable and topological dynamical systems over locally compact abelian groups. Our main observation relates convergence of Wiener-Wintner type averages to eigenvalues of the dynamical system in question. As a consequence we infer existence of Fourier--Bohr coefficients for all characters for a set of points satisfying a specific genericity condition. In the topological case this leads naturally to the concept of what we call Wiener--Wintner point and we present a thorough study of such points. In particular we show that they have full measure in the ergodic case, and we relate them to Besicovitch almost periodicity. For dynamical systems of translation bounded measures, which are the crucial models in aperiodic order, our results give that the Wiener--Wintner points are exactly the points allowing for a diffraction theory with the consistent phase property.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal dynamics for a class of monotone evolution systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, under an abstract setting we establish the spreading properties and the existence, non-existence and global attractivity of spatially heterogeneous steady states for a large class of monotone evolution systems without the translational monotonicity under the assumption that one limiting system has both leftward and rightward spreading speeds and the other one has the uniform asymptotic annihilation. Then we apply the developed theory to study the global dynamics of asymptotically homogeneous integro-difference equations, and provide a counter-example to show that the value of the nonlinear function at the finite range of location may give rise to nontrivial fixed points.</description>

      <title>On density analogs of Hindman's finite sums theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density, we show the existence of an infinite set $B$ and sequences $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}, (s_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B + s_k, 1 \leq |F| \leq k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. This strengthens the density finite sums theorem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. We further show, given such a set $A$, the existence of an infinite set $B$ and a sequence $(t_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $\left\{ \sum_{n \in F}n : F \subset B, |F| = k \right\}\subset A-t_k$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. As a corollary, we obtain a sequence $(B_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sets of natural numbers such that $B_1+\cdots +B_k \subset A$, for every $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We also establish the optimality of our main theorems by providing counterexamples to potential further generalizations, and thereby addressing questions of the aforementioned authors in the context of density analogs to Hindman's finite sums theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the entropic continuity of Lyapunov exponent for C^r maps of the interval or of the circle with large entropy for r&gt;1, without making any assumptions on the set of critical points. A consequence is the upper semi-continuity of entropy at ergodic measures with large entropy. Another consequence is the uniform integrability of the geometric potential at ergodic measures with large entropy.</description>

      <title>General Fractional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General fractional dynamics (GFDynamics) can be viewed as an interdisciplinary science, in which the non-local properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems are studied by using of general fractional calculus, equations with general fractional integrals (GFI) and derivatives (GFD), or general nonlocal mappings with discrete time. The GFDynamics implies research and obtaining results concerning of general form of nonlocality, which can be described by general form operator kernels, and not its particular implementations and representations. In this paper, it is proposed the concept of "general nonlocal maps" that are exact solutions of equations with GFI and GFD at discrete points. In these maps, the non-locality is determined by the kernels that are associated to the Sonin and Luchko kernels of general fractional integrals and derivatives, which are used in initial equations. Using general fractional calculus, we consider fractional systems with general non-locality in time, which are described by equations with general fractional operators and periodic kicks. Equations with GFI and GFD of arbitrary order are also used to derive general nonlocal maps. Exact solutions for these general fractional differential and integral equations with kicks are obtained. These exact solutions with discrete time points are used to derive general nonlocal maps without approximations. Some examples of non-locality in time are described.</description>

      <title>Dynamic threshold curves and response precision in forced excitable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate here various properties of the responses of excitable systems subject to periodic forcing and noise. While the properties of intrinsic oscillators, subject to added periodic signals, are well understood, much less is known about the factors that determine the response precision of excitable units, intrinsically at rest, when activated by periodic forcing and stochastic noise. One motivation for considering this issue comes from the behavior of auditory neurons. These neurons reportedly have the ability to fire spikes in a precise range of phases in response to incoming sound waves, a behavior for which the mechanism is unknown. To account for such a response precision, we introduce the notion of dynamic threshold curve (DTC), which estimates at each time the effective likelihood that noise will subsequently generate a spike. The DTC effectively summarizes, in a single curve, a representation of the response precision of an excitable model, as we demonstrate by showing that the distribution of spike times produced in this setting is well captured by the first passage time of a simple, Gaussian stochastic process to the distance to the DTC. This result shows that peaks and troughs of the DTC, but also their slopes, convey fine information about spike timing in response to noise. In particular, it explains properties of Type 2 and Type 3 excitable cells studied previously and provides a framework to predict the DTC properties necessary to support the response precision of auditory neurons, as we illustrate in a well-established auditory neuron model.</description>

      <title>Extending Rational Expanding Thurston Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider postcritically finite rational maps $f\colon \widehat{\mathbb{C}} \to \widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ whose Julia set is the whole Riemann sphere $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$. We call such a map an expanding rational Thurston map. Identifying $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ with the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we show that $f$ may be extended on a neighborhood $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ of $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$ to a quasi-regular map $F\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^3$. In fact, $F$ is uniformly quasi-regular in the following sense. The sequence of iterates $F^n$, each of which is defined on a neighborhood $\Omega_n$ of $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}= \mathbb{S}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, is uniformly quasi-regular. Here $\Omega_n$ shrink to $\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$, meaning that $\bigcap \Omega_n = \widehat{\mathbb{C}}$.
  This result may be viewed as a non-homeomorphic version of the extension of a quasi-conformal mapping $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2$ to a quasi-conformal mapping $F\colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ due to Ahlfors.</description>

      <title>Traveling Waves in the McKean-Vlasov Equation under Sakaguchi-Kuramoto Interaction with Phase Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the McKean-Vlasov equation for weakly coupled oscillators subject to the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto interaction. While the Kuramoto interaction provides a good approximation for small, densely connected networks, time delays in larger networks lead to symmetry-breaking phase offsets (frustrations). The Sakaguchi-Kuramoto interaction is the simplest such generalization, featuring a single frustration parameter. We establish the existence of a continuous global phase transition from incoherence to coherence, in the form of a propagating asymmetrically extended von Mises probability distribution function (AvMPDF). The corresponding traveling wave equation reduces to a system of two equations in two unknowns: the order parameter for the AvMPDF and the wave speed. The analysis relies on an appropriate asymmetrical extension of the modified Bessel function.</description>

      <title>A quantitative framework for sets of exact approximation order by rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a quantitative notion of exactness within Diophantine approximation. Given $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ and $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ satisfying $\lim_{q\to\infty}\omega(q)=0$, we study the set of points, which we call $E(\Psi,\omega)$, that are $\Psi$-well approximable but not $\Psi(1-\omega)$-well approximable. We prove results on the cardinality and dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. In particular we obtain the following general statements: (i) For any $\omega:(0,\infty)\to (0,1)$ and $\tau&gt;2$ there exists $\Psi:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that $\lim_{q\to\infty}\frac{-\log \Psi(q)}{\log q}=\tau$ and $E(\Psi,\omega)\neq\emptyset.$ (ii) Under natural monotonicity assumptions on $\Psi$ and $\omega,$ we prove that if $\omega$ decays to zero sufficiently slowly (in a way that depends upon $\Psi$) then $E(\Psi,\omega)$ is uncountable. Moreover, under further natural assumptions on $\Psi$ we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension of $E(\Psi,\omega)$.
  Our main result demonstrates a new threshold for the behaviour of $E(\Psi,\omega)$. A particular instance of this threshold is illustrated by considering functions of the form $\Psi_{\tau}(q)=q^{-\tau}$ when $\tau\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 3}$. For these functions we prove the following: (iii) If $\omega(q)= Cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some sufficiently large $C$ or $\omega(q)=q^{-\tau'}$ for some $\tau'&lt;\tau(\tau-1),$ then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)$ is uncountable and we calculate its Hausdorff dimension. (iv) If $\omega(q)&lt; cq^{-\tau(\tau-1)}$ for some $c\in (0,1)$ for all $q$ sufficiently large then $E(\Psi_{\tau},\omega)=\emptyset.$</description>

      <title>Limits of Quadratic Rational Maps: The Cantor Locus</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.03798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{Cantor locus} is the unique hyperbolic component, in the moduli space of quadratic rational maps ${\bf rat}_2$, consisting of maps with totally disconnected Julia sets. Whereas the geometry and dynamics of the Cantor locus is well understood, its boundary and the dynamics of the maps on the boundary are not. In this paper, we explore the dynamics near the parabolic parts of the boundary.
  We introduce the concept \emph{dynamical marking} of a map $g$, relative to the quadratic, parabolic polynomial $\mathrm{P}_{\opq}(z)={\opq} z+z^2$, with $\opq=e^{2\pi ip/q}$. A dynamical marking $(x,\psi)$ of $g$ is a conjugacy $\psi$ between $\mathrm{P}_{\opq}$ (on its parabolic basin of 0) and $g$, which \emph{marks} the dynamical position of the critical values $v_1=\psi(-\frac{\lambda^2}{4})$, $v_2=\psi(x)$ of $g$.
  We construct a local parametrization of the Cantor locus, which parametrizes by dynamical marking, and use it to prove a form of \emph{stability} of dynamical marking. That is, for sequences in the Cantor locus, of fixed dynamical marking $x$ and such that the eigenvalue $\lambda_k$ of the attracting fixed point tends to $\opq$ \emph{subhorocyclicly}, either the sequence converges to the unique parabolic parameter in the boundary, which has a fixed point eigenvalue $\opq$ and which is marked by $x$ relative to $\mathrm{P}_{\opq}$. Or, the sequence tends to infinity in ${\bf rat}_2$, and certain representatives $G_{\lambda_k,a_k}$ have \emph{rescaled} limits in the boundary of the Cantor locus within ${\bf rat}_2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a shrinking target problem with target at infinity in a homogeneous space of a semisimple algebraic group from the representation-theoretic point of view. Let $\rho:\mathbf G\to\mathbf{GL}(V)$ be an irreducible $\mathbb Q$-rational representation of a connected semisimple $\mathbb Q$-algebraic group $\mathbf G$ on a complex vector space $V$, $\{a_t\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$ a one-parameter subgroup in a $\mathbb Q$-split torus in $\mathbf G$ and $\psi:\mathbb R_+\to\mathbb R_+$ a positive function on $\mathbb R_+$. We define a subset $S_\rho(\psi)$ of $\psi$-Diophantine elements in $\mathbf G(\mathbb R)$ in terms of the representation $\rho$ and $\{a_t\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$, and prove formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of the complement of $S_{\rho}(\psi)$. We also discuss the connections of our results to Diophantine approximation on flag varieties and rational approximation to linear subspaces in Grassmann varieties.</description>

      <title>Regularity of non-autonomous self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-autonomous self-similar sets are a family of compact sets which are, in some sense, highly homogeneous in space but highly inhomogeneous in scale. The main purpose of this note is to clarify various regularity properties and separation conditions relevant for the fine local scaling properties of these sets. A simple application of our results is a precise formula for the Assouad dimension of non-autonomous self-similar sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying a certain ``bounded neighbourhood'' condition, which generalizes earlier work of Li--Li--Miao--Xi and Olson--Robinson--Sharples. We also see that the bounded neighbourhood assumption is, in few different senses, as general as possible.</description>

      <title>Backward bifurcations and multistationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of backward bifurcations provides a criterion for the existence of positive steady states in epidemiological models with parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It is often seen in simulations that this phenomenon is accompanied by multistationarity, i.e. the existence of more than one positive steady state, but the latter circumstance is not implied by the general theory. The central result of this paper is a theorem which gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state for parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It also gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state in the case that the basic reproductive ratio is greater than one. These steady states arise in a bifurcation. It is shown that in one case, a model for the in-host dynamics of hepatitis C, this result can be used as a basis for showing the existence of parameters for which there are two positive steady states, one of which is stable. Thus, in particular, multistationarity is proved in that case. It is also shown to what extent this theorem can be applied to some other models which have been studied in the literature and what new results can be obtained. In that context the new approach is compared with those previously known.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of measures of maximal entropy for certain skew products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a relation between the continuity of the fiber entropy and the continuity of the fiber Lyapunov exponents for skew products with 2-dimensional fibers. This result extends the theorem for surfaces proved by Buzzi-Crovisier-Sarig. As a consequence, we are able to obtain classes of skew products that satisfies the strong positive recurrence (SPR) property, in particular these maps have finite number of measures of maximal entropy, all exponentially mixing with good statistical properties.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of homshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of symbolic dynamical systems called homshifts: they are the nearest-neighbour $\mathbb{Z}^d$ shifts of finite type whose adjacency rules are the same in every direction. Building on the work of Klaus Schmidt (Pacific J. Math. 170 (1995), no.1, 237-269) we give a necessary and sufficient condition for homshifts to be cohomological trivial. This condition is expressed in terms of the topology of a natural simplicial complex arising from the shift space which can be analyzed in many natural cases. However, we prove that in general, cohomological triviality is algorithmically undecidable for homshifts.</description>

      <title>Free nilspaces, double-coset nilspaces, and Gowers norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact finite-rank nilspaces have become central in the nilspace approach to higher-order Fourier analysis, notably through their role in a general form of the inverse theorem for the Gowers norms. This paper studies these nilspaces per se, and in connection with further refinements of this inverse theorem that have been conjectured recently. Our first main result states that every compact finite-rank nilspace is obtained by taking a free nilspace (a nilspace based on an abelian group of the form $\mathbb{Z}^{r}\times \mathbb{R}^s$) and quotienting this by a discrete group action of a specific type, describable in terms of polynomials. We call these group actions "higher-order lattice actions", as they generalize actions of lattices in $\mathbb{Z}^r\times \mathbb{R}^s$. The second main result (which relies on the first one) represents every compact finite-rank nilspace as a double-coset space $K\backslash G / \Gamma$ where $G$ is a nilpotent Lie group of a specific kind. Our third main result extends the aforementioned results to $k$-step compact nilspaces (not necessarily of finite rank), by representing any such nilspace as a quotient of infinite products of free nilspaces and also as double coset spaces $K\backslash G/\Gamma$ where $G$ is a degree-$k$ nilpotent pro-Lie group. These results open the study of compact nilspaces to areas more classical than nilspace theory, such as the theory of topological group actions. The results also require developing the theory of topological non-compact nilspaces, for which we provide groundwork in this paper. Applications include new inverse theorems for Gowers norms on any finite abelian group. These theorems are purely group theoretic in that the correlating harmonics are based on double-coset spaces. This yields progress towards the Jamneshan-Tao conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the uniformity and size of microsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve a few questions regarding the uniformity and size of microsets of subsets of Euclidean space. First, we construct a compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with Assouad dimension arbitrarily close to $d$ such that every microset of $K$ has no Ahlfors--David regular subset with dimension strictly larger than $0$. This answers a question of Orponen. Then, we show that for any non-empty compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with lower dimension $\beta$, there is a microset $E$ of $K$ with finite $\beta$-dimensional packing pre-measure. This answers a strong version of a question of Fraser--Howroyd--K\"aenm\"aki--Yu, who previously obtained a similar result concerning the upper box dimension.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>
