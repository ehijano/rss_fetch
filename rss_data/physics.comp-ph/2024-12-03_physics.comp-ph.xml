      <title>Monte Carlo Sensitivity Coefficients and Analytical Benchmarks for Unresolved Resonance Probability Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo differential operator sampling method is applied to the computation of sensitivity coefficients of unresolved resonance probability table cross sections. Three new analytical benchmarks for verifying unresolved resonance treatments and sensitivity coefficient computations are developed. The method and its research-code implementation are verified against these benchmarks and agreement is observed. Numerical results for unresolved resonance sensitivity coefficients are obtained for the Big Ten benchmark and a simplified Molten Chloride Fast Reactor model. Energy-integrated eigenvalue sensitivity coefficients for the unresolved resonance range agree with MCNP6.2 calculations of these two models.</description>

      <title>Integrated simulation of cavity design and radiation transport codes (ACE3P + Geant4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simulation workflow has been developed to study dark current (DC) radiation effects using ACE3P and Geant4. The integrated workflow interfaces particle data transfer and geometry between the electromagnetic (EM) cavity simulation code ACE3P and the radiation code Geant4, targeting large-scale problems using high-performance computing. The process begins by calculating the operating mode in the vacuum region of an accelerator structure and tracking field-emitted electrons influenced by the EM fields of the mode calculated by ACE3P. It then transfers particle data at the vacuum-wall interface for subsequent radiation calculations within the wall enclosure materials through Geant4 calculation. The whole integrated simulation workflow will be demonstrated through large-scale dark current radiation calculations for the KEK 56-cell traveling-wave structure, and the efficiency of performing these simulations on the NERSC supercomputer Perlmutter will be presented.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Description of Platelet Deformation Using a Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to investigate the capability of a neural operator (DeepONet) to accurately capture the complex deformation of a platelet's membrane under shear flow. The surrogate model approximated by the neural operator predicts the deformed membrane configuration based on its initial configuration and the shear stress exerted by the blood flow. The training dataset is derived from particle dynamics simulations implemented in LAMMPS. The neural operator captures the dynamics of the membrane particles with a mode error distribution of approximately 0.5\%. The proposed implementation serves as a scalable approach to integrate sub-platelet dynamics into multi-scale computational models of thrombosis.</description>

      <title>FeynKrack: A continuum model for quasi-brittle damage through Feynman-Kac killed diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum damage mechanics (CDM) is a popular framework for modelling crack propagation in solids. The CDM uses a damage parameter to quantitatively assess what one loosely calls `material degradation'. While this parameter is sometimes given a physical meaning, the mathematical equations for its evolution are generally not consistent with such physical interpretations. Curiously, degradation in the CDM may be viewed as a change of measures, wherein the damage variable appears as the Radon-Nikodym derivative. We adopt this point of view and use a probabilistic measure-valued description for the random microcracks underlying quasi-brittle damage. We show that the evolution of the underlying density may be described via killed diffusion as in the Feynman-Kac theory. Damage growth is then interpreted as the reduction in this measure over a region, which in turn quantifies the disruption of bonds through a loss of force-transmitting mechanisms between nearby material points. Remarkably, the evolution of damage admits an approximate closed-form solution. This brings forth substantive computational ease, facilitating fast yet accurate simulations of large dimensional problems. By selecting an appropriate killing rate, one accounts for the irreversibility of damage and thus eliminates the need for ad-hoc history-dependent routes typically employed, say, in phase field modelling of damage. Our proposal FeynKrack (a short form for Feynman-Kac crack propagator) is validated and demonstrated for its efficacy through several simulations on quasi-brittle damage. It also offers a promising stochastic route for future explorations of non-equilibrium thermodynamic aspects of damage.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Kohn-Sham ansatz for strongly-correlated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to expand the territory of density functional theory to strongly-correlated electrons by reformulating the Kohn-Sham ansatz in the representation of fractionalized particles. We call it the ''KS* ansatz''. Using inhomogeneous t-J chains as a test bed, we show that the KS* ansatz with simple local density approximtion is able to achieve accurate ground state energy and density distribution comparable to the density matrix renormalization group method, while the computational complexity is much lower.</description>

      <title>Enhanced solid solution hardening by off-center substitutional solute atoms in {\alpha}-Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most recently, some substitutional solute atoms in {\alpha}-Ti have been predicted to occupy unexpectedly the low-symmetry (LS) positions away from the high-symmetry (HS) lattice site, which was speculated to result in enhanced solid solution hardening (SSH). In the present work, the SSH induced by the LS off-center solute atom is evaluated within the framework of continuum elasticity theory, in comparison with that induced by its HS lattice-site counterpart. The interaction energy and force between the solute atom and the basal/prismatic edge/screw &lt;a&gt; dislocations in {\alpha}-Ti solid solution are calculated with the elastic dipole model, with which the strength increments induced by the solute atoms are evaluated with the Labusch model. We show that, in general, the LS solute atom interacts much more strongly with the dislocations than its HS counterpart does. The calculated interaction energies suggest that the LS solute atom forms atmosphere above/below the slip plane of the basal &lt;a&gt; dislocations but on the slip plane of the prismatic &lt;a&gt; dislocations regardless of the dislocation types (edge or screw). The strength increments caused by most of the LS solute atoms are more than an order of magnitude higher than those by their HS counterparts. The SSH effect induced by the LS solute atom is mainly determined by the strength of the Jahn-Teller splitting of the d-orbitals of the solute atom, dissimilar to that induced by HS solute atom where the atomic size mismatch dominates.</description>

      <title>Enhancing multiscale simulations for spark plasma sintering with a novel Direct FE$^2$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spark plasma sintering (SPS) process, a key technology for advanced material manufacturing, demands accurate and efficient simulation tools to capture the complex electro-thermal-mechanical interactions inherent in powder materials. This paper introduces a novel concurrent multiscale framework employing the Direct FE$^2$ method, designed for fully coupled electro-thermal-mechanical simulations in SPS. The model integrates microscale powder characteristics into a macroscopic analysis through multi-point constraints within a 3D finite element (FE) solver. This approach enables, for the first time, a direct and seamless coupling of micro- and macroscale physical phenomena, enhancing both accuracy and computational efficiency by capturing interactions across scales. The proposed method achieves a temperature and displacement error margin below 1% compared to full FE analysis while reducing computational degrees of freedom by a factor of 8, resulting in a 70-fold acceleration in simulation time. Additionally, the methodology provides robust flexibility in accommodating diverse powder morphologies without compromising precision, enabling degree-of-freedom reductions of up to 44 times. This combination of enhanced efficiency and accuracy establishes the proposed Direct FE$^2$ approach as a highly effective tool for realistic and scalable simulations of the SPS process.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of parallel computations of gravitational forces by TreeCode method in N-body models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of collisionless galactic systems is based on the N-body model, which requires large computational resources due to the long-range nature of gravitational forces. The most common method for calculating gravity is the TreeCode algorithm, which provides a faster calculation of the force compared to the direct summation of contributions from all particles for N-body simulation. An analysis of the computational efficiency is performed for models with the number of particles up to $10^{8}$. We considered several processors with different architectures in order to determine the performance of parallel simulations based on the OpenMP standard. An analysis of the use of extra threads in addition to physical cores shows an increase in simulation performance only when all logical threads are loaded, which doubles the total number of threads. This gives an increase in the efficiency of parallel computing by 20 percent on average.</description>

      <title>Twisted terahertz radiation generation using Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulse propagating in axially magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical and simulation study of twisted terahertz (THz) radiation generation via propagation of a circularly polarized Laguerre Gaussian (LG) laser pulse in homogeneous plasma embedded in an axial magnetic field. Analytical formulation is based on perturbation technique and quasistatic approximation. Longitudinal and transverse wakefields generated via laser plasma interactions are evaluated using Lorentz force and Maxwells equations in the mildly nonlinear regime. It is observed that two linearly polarized twisted terahertz (THz) radiation beams are generated in mutually perpendicular planes. Superposition of the two beams result in a single linearly polarized twisted THz radiation beam with modified amplitude and polarization direction. Three dimensional (3D) particle in cell (PIC) simulations are performed for this configuration using FBPIC code. Graphical comparison of amplitude of the resultant THz beam obtained via analytical and simulation studies is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new way to learn Physics-Informed Neural Network loss functions using Generalized Additive Models. We apply our method by meta-learning parametric partial differential equations, PDEs, on Burger's and 2D Heat Equations. The goal is to learn a new loss function for each parametric PDE using meta-learning. The derived loss function replaces the traditional data loss, allowing us to learn each parametric PDE more efficiently, improving the meta-learner's performance and convergence.</description>

      <title>Basis set incompleteness errors in fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on non-covalent interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Basis set incompleteness error (BSIE) is a common source of error in quantum chemistry (QC) calculations, but it has not been comprehensively studied in fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) calculations. FN-DMC, being a projection method, is often considered minimally affected by basis set biases. Here, we show that this assumption is not always valid. While the relative error introduced by a small basis set in the total FN-DMC energy is minor, it can become significant in binding energy ($E_{\rm b}$) evaluations of weakly interacting systems. We systematically investigated BSIEs in FN-DMC-based binding energy ($E_{\rm b}$) evaluations using the A24 dataset, a well-known benchmark set of 24 non-covalently bound dimers. Contrary to common expectations, we found that BSIEs in FN-DMC evaluations of $E_{\rm b}$ are indeed significant when small localized basis sets, such as cc-pVDZ, are employed. We observed that BSIEs are larger in dimers with hydrogen-bonding interactions and smaller in dispersion-dominated interactions. We also found that augmenting the basis sets with diffuse orbitals, using counterpoise (CP) correction, or both, effectively mitigates BSIEs.</description>

      <title>PAL -- Parallel active learning for machine-learned potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing datasets representative of the target domain is essential for training effective machine learning models. Active learning (AL) is a promising method that iteratively extends training data to enhance model performance while minimizing data acquisition costs. However, current AL workflows often require human intervention and lack parallelism, leading to inefficiencies and underutilization of modern computational resources. In this work, we introduce PAL, an automated, modular, and parallel active learning library that integrates AL tasks and manages their execution and communication on shared- and distributed-memory systems using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). PAL provides users with the flexibility to design and customize all components of their active learning scenarios, including machine learning models with uncertainty estimation, oracles for ground truth labeling, and strategies for exploring the target space. We demonstrate that PAL significantly reduces computational overhead and improves scalability, achieving substantial speed-ups through asynchronous parallelization on CPU and GPU hardware. Applications of PAL to several real-world scenarios - including ground-state reactions in biomolecular systems, excited-state dynamics of molecules, simulations of inorganic clusters, and thermo-fluid dynamics - illustrate its effectiveness in accelerating the development of machine learning models. Our results show that PAL enables efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources in active learning workflows, fostering advancements in scientific research and engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing multiple Large Language Model agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation and that can execute code locally may become beneficial in cosmological data analysis. Here, we illustrate a first small step towards AI-assisted analyses and a glimpse of the potential of MAS to automate and optimize scientific workflows in Cosmology. The system architecture of our example package, that builds upon the autogen/ag2 framework, can be applied to MAS in any area of quantitative scientific research. The particular task we apply our methods to is the cosmological parameter analysis of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing power spectrum likelihood using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our work-in-progress code is open source and available at https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent.</description>

      <title>Scalable nonlinear manifold reduced order model for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The domain decomposition (DD) nonlinear-manifold reduced-order model (NM-ROM) represents a computationally efficient method for integrating underlying physics principles into a neural network-based, data-driven approach. Compared to linear subspace methods, NM-ROMs offer superior expressivity and enhanced reconstruction capabilities, while DD enables cost-effective, parallel training of autoencoders by partitioning the domain into algebraic subdomains. In this work, we investigate the scalability of this approach by implementing a "bottom-up" strategy: training NM-ROMs on smaller domains and subsequently deploying them on larger, composable ones. The application of this method to the two-dimensional time-dependent Burgers' equation shows that extrapolating from smaller to larger domains is both stable and effective. This approach achieves an accuracy of 1% in relative error and provides a remarkable speedup of nearly 700 times.</description>

      <title>Extending the atomic decomposition and many-body representation, a chemistry-motivated monomer-centered approach for machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most widely used machine learned (ML) potentials for condensed phase applications rely on many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) or atom-centered neural networks (NN). However, these approaches often lack chemical interpretability in atomistic energy decomposition and the computational efficiency of traditional force fields has not been fully achieved. Here, we present a novel method that combines aspects of both approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and force field-level speed. This method utilizes a monomer-centered representation, where the potential energy is decomposed into the sum of chemically meaningful monomeric energies. Without sophisticated neural network design, the structural descriptors of monomers are described by 1-body and 2-body effective interactions, enforced by appropriate sets of PIPs as inputs to the feed forward NN. We demonstrate the performance of this method through systematic assessments of models for gas-phase water trimer, liquid water, and also liquid CO2. The high accuracy, fast speed, and flexibility of this method provide a new route for constructing accurate ML potentials and enabling large-scale quantum and classical simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Operator learning regularization for macroscopic permeability prediction in dual-scale flow problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid composites moulding is an important manufacturing technology for fibre reinforced composites, due to its cost-effectiveness. Challenges lie in the optimisation of the process due to the lack of understanding of key characteristic of textile fabrics - permeability. The problem of computing the permeability coefficient can be modelled as the well-known Stokes-Brinkman equation, which introduces a heterogeneous parameter $\beta$ distinguishing macropore regions and fibre-bundle regions. In the present work, we train a Fourier neural operator to learn the nonlinear map from the heterogeneous coefficient $\beta$ to the velocity field $u$, and recover the corresponding macroscopic permeability $K$. This is a challenging inverse problem since both the input and output fields span several order of magnitudes, we introduce different regularization techniques for the loss function and perform a quantitative comparison between them.</description>

      <title>Thermal creep behavior of refractory high-entropy alloy: an atomistic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) is a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep behavior of MoNbTaW RHEA under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which can be controlled during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced with larger grain size and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>

      <title>Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invariant measures are widely used to compare chaotic dynamical systems, as they offer robustness to noisy data, uncertain initial conditions, and irregular sampling. However, large classes of systems with distinct transient dynamics can still exhibit the same asymptotic statistical behavior, which poses challenges when invariant measures alone are used to perform system identification. Motivated by Takens' seminal embedding theory, we propose studying invariant measures in time-delay coordinates, which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that a single invariant measure in time-delay coordinates can be used to perform system identification up to a topological conjugacy. This result already surpasses the capabilities of invariant measures in the original state coordinate. Continuing to explore the power of delay-coordinates, we eliminate all ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that unique system identification can be achieved using additional invariant measures in time-delay coordinates constructed from different observables. Our findings improve the effectiveness of invariant measures in system identification and broaden the scope of measure-theoretic approaches to modeling dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Rotating Newtonian Universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a novel type of numerical simulation that realizes a rotating Universe with a shear-free, rigid body rotation inspired by a G\"{o}del-like metric. We run cosmological simulations of unperturbed glasses with various degrees of rotation in the Einstein-de Sitter and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. To achieve this, we use the StePS N-body code capable of simulating the infinite Universe, overcoming the technical obstacles of classical toroidal (periodic) topologies that would otherwise prevent us from running such simulations. Results show a clear anisotropy between the polar and equatorial expansion rates with more than $1\%$ deviation from the isotropic case for maximal rotation without closed timeline curves within the horizon, $\omega_{0} \approx 10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$; a considerable effect in the era of precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Explicit and data-Efficient Encoding via Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}</description>

      <title>Transistors based on Novel 2-D Monolayer Semiconductors Bi2O2Se, InSe, and MoSi2N4 for Enhanced Logic Density Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation based on duality to solve partial differential equations: Use of B-splines and machine learning approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Navier--Stokes equations in fluid mechanics, inelastic deformation in solids, and transient parabolic and hyperbolic equations do not have an exact, primal variational structure. Recently, a variational principle based on the dual (Lagrange multiplier) field was proposed. The essential idea in this approach is to treat the given PDE as constraints, and to invoke an arbitrarily chosen auxiliary potential with strong convexity properties to be optimized. This leads to requiring a convex dual functional to be minimized subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual variables, with the guarantee that even PDEs that do not possess a variational structure in primal form can be solved via a variational principle. The vanishing of the first variation of the dual functional is, up to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual fields, the weak form of the primal PDE problem with the dual-to-primal change of variables incorporated. We derive the dual weak form for the linear, one-dimensional, transient convection-diffusion equation. A Galerkin discretization is used to obtain the discrete equations, with the trial and test functions chosen as linear combination of either RePU activation functions (shallow neural network) or B-spline basis functions; the corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric. For transient problems, a space-time Galerkin implementation is used with tensor-product B-splines as approximating functions. Numerical results are presented for the steady-state and transient convection-diffusion equation, and transient heat conduction. The proposed method delivers sound accuracy for ODEs and PDEs and rates of convergence are established in the $L^2$ norm and $H^1$ seminorm for the steady-state convection-diffusion problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-vectorial finite difference method with perfectly matched layers boundaries is used to identify the single mode operation region of submicron rib waveguides fabricated using sili-con-on-insulator material system. Achieving high mode power confinement factors is emphasized while maintaining the single mode operation. As opposed to the case of large cross-section rib waveguides, theoretical single mode conditions have been demonstrated to hold for sub-micron waveguides with accuracy approaching 100%. Both, the deeply and the shallowly etched rib waveguides have been considered and the single mode condition for entire sub-micrometer range is presented while adhering to design specific mode confinement requirements.</description>

      <title>Mean Mesh Adaptation for Efficient CFD Simulations with Operating Conditions Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When numerically solving partial differential equations, for a given problem and operating condition, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) has proven its efficiency to automatically build a discretization achieving a prescribed accuracy at low cost. However, with continuously varying operating conditions, such as those encountered in uncertainty quantification, adapting a mesh for each evaluated condition becomes complex and computationally expensive. To enable more effective error and cost control, this work introduces a novel approach to mesh adaptation. The method consists in building a unique adapted mesh that aims at minimizing the average error for a continuous set operating conditions. In the proposed implementation, this unique mesh is built iteratively, informed by an estimate of the local average error over a reduced set of sample conditions. The effectiveness and performance of the method are demonstrated on a one-dimensional Burgers equation and a two-dimensional Euler scramjet shocked flow configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that including the second viscosity of an electron gas in the hydrodynamic model allows for highly accurate modeling of the optical response of heavily doped semiconductors. In our setup, which improves resonance visibility compared to previous approaches, plasmon resonances become more distinct, allowing for detailed analysis of the underlying physics. With advanced fitting techniques based on a physics-informed cost function and a tailored optimization algorithm, we obtain close agreement between simulations and experimental data across different sample thicknesses. This enhanced resonance visibility, combined with our integrated approach, shows that key parameters such as doping level and effective electron mass can be retrieved from a single optical measurement. The spatial dispersion taken into account in the hydrodynamic framework is essential for accurately describing the optical response of plasmonic materials in this frequency range and is likely to become a standard modeling approach.</description>

Abstract: We present a general-purpose algorithm for automatic production of a structure that induces a desired Casimir-Polder force. As a demonstration of the capability and wide applicability of the method, we use it to develop a geometry that leads to a repulsive Casimir-Polder force on a ground-state atom. The results turn out to be reminiscent of the ring-like geometries previously used to induce repulsion, but with some new features and -- importantly -- discovered completely independently of any input from the user. This represents a powerful new paradigm in the study of atom-surface forces -- instead of the user testing various geometries against a desired figure of merit, the goal can be specified and then an appropriate geometry created automatically.</description>

      <title>Double Layer-Interlocked Crystals of Nitrogen-Rich Compounds under Zero-Pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01497v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions is a key issue in the development and application of high-energy density materials (HEDMs). Herein, a two-dimensional double-layer interlocked Li4(N5)2 nitrogen-rich compound crystals, in which the two N5 rings are locked to by sharing four Li atoms, was found to maintain structural stability at zero pressure conditions. Dynamics studies reliably confirm crystal stability below 250 K. Furthermore, the stability of Li4(N5)2 crystal mainly arises from the ionic interaction between Li atoms and N5 rings, formed by the charge transfer from Li atoms to N5 rings. This study highlights the feasibility of stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions, paving the way for atomic level advancements in HEDMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range electrostatic interactions critically affect polar materials. However, state-of-the-art atomistic potentials, such as neural networks or Gaussian approximation potentials employed in large-scale simulations, often neglect the role of these long-range electrostatic interactions.
  This study introduces a novel model derived from first principles to evaluate the contribution of long-range electrostatic interactions to total energies, forces, and stresses. The model is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing short-range force fields without further first-principles calculations or retraining. The approach relies solely on physical observables, like the dielectric tensor and Born effective charges, that can be consistently calculated from first principles. We demonstrate that the model reproduces critical features, such as the LO-TO splitting and the long-wavelength phonon dispersions of polar materials, with benchmark results on the cubic phase of barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$).</description>

Abstract: While the accurate description of redox reactions remains a challenge for first-principles calculations, it has been shown that extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+U+V) can provide a reliable approach, mitigating self-interaction errors, in materials with strongly localized d or f electrons. Here, we first show that DFT+U+V molecular dynamics is capable to follow the adiabatic evolution of oxidation states over time, using representative Li-ion cathode materials. In turn, this allows to develop redox-aware machine-learned potentials. We show that considering atoms with different oxidation states (as accurately predicted by DFT+U+V) as distinct species in the training leads to potentials that are able to identify the correct ground state and pattern of oxidation states for redox elements present. This can be achieved, e.g., through a systematic combinatorial search for the lowest energy configuration or with stochastic methods. This brings the advantages of machine-learned potentials to key technological applications (e.g., rechargeable batteries), which require an accurate description of the evolution of redox states.</description>

      <title>Classifying pedestrian crossing flows: A data-driven approach using fundamental diagrams and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of pedestrian crossing flows with varying crossing angles $\alpha$ to classify different scenarios and derive implications for crowd management. Probability density functions of four key features$-$velocity $v$, density $\rho$, avoidance number $Av$, and intrusion number $In$$-$were analyzed to characterize pedestrian behavior. Velocity-density fundamental diagrams were constructed for each $\alpha$ and fitted with functional forms from existing literature. Classification attempts using $Av$-$In$ and $v$-$\rho$ phase spaces revealed significant overlaps, highlighting the limitations of these metrics alone for scenario differentiation. To address this, machine learning models, including logistic regression and random forest, were employed using all four features. Results showed robust classification performance, with $v$ and $Av$ contributing most significantly. Insights from feature importance metrics and classification accuracy offer practical guidance for managing high-density crowds, optimizing pedestrian flow, and designing safer public spaces. These findings provide a data-driven framework for advancing pedestrian dynamics research.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of Proximity-Induced Superconductivity in PbTe/Pb heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices have been proposed as promising platforms for detecting and analyzing Majorana zero modes, which find applications in topological quantum computing. In this work, we solve the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to describe the normal and superconducting properties of a PbTe/Pb heterostructure. We resolve a proximity-induced superconducting gap on the PbTe side. The hybridization between PbTe and Pb causes the emergence of a soft Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconducting gap. We compute the anomalous charge density in real space, estimating its decay length and showing that the pairing potential is anisotropic, which is a necessary condition for unconventional superconductivity. Contrary to the models that predict Majorana zero modes in these interfaces, we find a significantly large Schottky barrier in the normal state preventing the emergence of zero modes. Our findings strengthen the understanding of the physics governing PbTe/Pb hybrid devices and their viability for Majorana zero modes applications.</description>

      <title>Rectangular finite elements for modeling the mechanical behavior of auxetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the exploration of rectangular finite elements' ability to model the stress-strain state of isotropic and orthotropic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetic materials. By employing linear elasticity in the plane stress formulation, the research evaluates the linear compatible and the quadratic incompatible shape functions in describing the mechanical behavior of auxetic materials within a displacement-based finite element method under static shear conditions. Additionally, the analytical expression of an incompatible rectangular finite element is adapted to accommodate an orthotropic case. Hexachiral and re-entrant honeycomb structures, characterized by auxetic behavior, are modeled as continuous media with homogenized properties using analytical expressions for their effective material constants. The findings reveal that while the classical shape functions may be sufficient for displacement modeling, they are ineffective in accurately predicting the characteristic auxetic behavior and stress distributions in auxetic materials. In contrast, the incompatible shape functions prove to be effective in providing appropriate stress modeling in both cases. This work underscores the relevance of the incompatible rectangular finite elements in the analysis of advanced materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. It provides computationally efficient approaches for the calculation of auxetic honeycomb structures and multilayer composites based on them.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Deep Learning Based Super-Resolution For The Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the nonlinear shallow water equations as benchmark, we demonstrate that a simulation with the ICON-O ocean model with a 20km resolution that is frequently corrected by a U-net-type neural network can achieve discretization errors of a simulation with 10km resolution. The network, originally developed for image-based super-resolution in post-processing, is trained to compute the difference between solutions on both meshes and is used to correct the coarse mesh every 12h. Our setup is the Galewsky test case, modeling transition of a barotropic instability into turbulent flow. We show that the ML-corrected coarse resolution run correctly maintains a balance flow and captures the transition to turbulence in line with the higher resolution simulation. After 8 day of simulation, the $L_2$-error of the corrected run is similar to a simulation run on the finer mesh. While mass is conserved in the corrected runs, we observe some spurious generation of kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and stability conditions of fermion and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable study by M. Gleiser and N. Jiang [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92}, 044046, 2015], the authors demonstrated that the stability regions of neutron stars, within the framework of the simple Fermi gas model, and self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar field (boson stars) with various self couplings, obtained through traditional perturbation methods, correlate with critical points of the configurational entropy with an accuracy of a few percent. Recently, P. Koliogiannis \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 044069 2023] found that while the minimization of the configurational entropy generally anticipates qualitatively the stability point for neutron stars and quark stars, this approach lacks universal validity. In this work, we aim to further elucidate this issue by seeking to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, we calculate the configurational entropy of bosonic and fermionic systems, described by interacting Fermi and boson gases, respectively, that form compact objects stabilized by gravity. We investigate whether the minimization of configurational entropy coincides with the stability point of the corresponding compact objects. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the stability points predicted by configurational entropy and those obtained through traditional methods, with the accuracy of this correlation showing a slight dependence on the interaction strength. Consequently, the stability of compact objects, composed of components obeying Fermi or boson statistics, can alternatively be assessed using the concept of configurational entropy.</description>

      <title>InvDesFlow: An AI search engine to explore possible high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>PINNfluence: Influence Functions for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/aleks-krasowski/PINNfluence.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effect of Sleeve Gastrectomy on Gastric Digestion in the Stomach: Insights from Multiphase Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data and the post-sleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and post-operative management.</description>
