      <title>Coronal energy release by MHD avalanches III. Identification of a reconnection outflow from a nanoflare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows perpendicular to the guide field are believed to be a possible signature of magnetic reconnection in the solar corona and specifically a way to detect the occurrence of ubiquitous small-angle magnetic reconnection. The aim of this work is to identify possible diagnostic techniques of such outflows in hot coronal loops with SDO/AIA and the forthcoming MUltislit Solar Explorer (MUSE), in a realistically dynamic coronal loop environment in which an MHD avalanche is occurring. We consider a 3D MHD model of two magnetic flux tubes, including a stratified, radiative and thermal-conducting atmosphere, twisted by footpoint rotation. The faster rotating flux tube becomes kink-unstable and soon involves the other one in the avalanche. The turbulent decay of this magnetic structure on a global scale leads to the formation, fragmentation, and dissipation of current sheets driving impulsive heating akin to a nanoflare storm. We captured a clear outflow from a reconnection episode soon after the initial avalanche and synthesized its emission as detectable with AIA and MUSE. The outflow has a maximum temperature around 8 MK, a total energy of 1024 erg, a velocity of a few hundred km/s, and a duration of less than 1 min. We show the emission in the AIA 94 A channel (Fe XVIII line) and in the MUSE 108 A Fe XIX spectral line. his outflow shares many features with nanojets recently detected at lower temperatures. Its low emission measure makes, however, its detection difficult with AIA, but Doppler shifts can be measured with MUSE. Conditions become different in a later steady state phase when the flux tubes are filled with denser and relatively cooler plasma.</description>

      <title>The Stationary Point: A New Method for Solar Wind Speed Measurements from a Moving Vantage Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WISPR imager on Parker Solar Probe provides a unique view the young solar wind, flying through solar wind structures at high speed. It is of interest to use WISPR image sequences to measure the velocity of both large features (such as CMEs) and the background, ambient wind. However, WISPR's close-up, rapidly-moving perspective makes the usual methods for measuring velocities from images difficult or impossible to apply, as most apparent motion through the image is due to the motion or rotation of the imager. In this work, we propose a new method of looking for features at the "stationary point" -- a direction from which some plasma parcels appear to approach the spacecraft, remaining at a constant direction in the image sequence. This direction is a function of the plasma's radial velocity, the encounter geometry, and the spacecraft velocity, allowing the former two to be inferred. We demonstrate the technique with forward-modeled images, and we apply it to WISPR observations, inferring the speed and trajectory of a particular density feature. This method promises to enable speed measurements of the young solar wind in an important acceleration region, from a close-up perspective and at latitudes well outside the PSP orbital plane. And while we present this method in a solar wind context, it is broadly applicable to any situation of a moving viewpoint traveling through an expanding cloud of features.</description>

      <title>Testing the wavelength dependence of oscillations and granulation in red giants using Kepler and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar oscillations and granulation in red giants are both powered by convection. Studying the wavelength dependence of their amplitudes can provide useful insights on the driving mechanism. It is also important for plans to carry out asteroseismology with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will operate in the near infrared, to check the dependence of oscillations and granulation on the observational wavelength. In this work, we aim to understand how the oscillation and granulation power in red giants depend on the wavelength and study how existing predictions compare with observations. We measure the mean oscillation and granulation power of 279 Kepler red giants, from the power density spectra derived using Kepler PDCSAP and TESS-SPOC light curves. We find that selection of light curves is important for the study of amplitudes, since different light curve products from TESS show different values of amplitudes. We show that the oscillation and granulation power ratios between TESS and Kepler match the theoretical prediction, confirming that both decrease as we move to redder wavelengths. We also see that the mean ratios of oscillations and granulation agree, suggesting that oscillation and granulation have the same wavelength dependence. We also find that the mean height-to-background ratio for Kepler agrees with previous results and shows good agreement with TESS. These results suggest that the granulation signals would not severely affect the detection of oscillations. We checked the dependence of these ratio between Kepler and TESS on stellar parameters, and see no trends.</description>

      <title>Half a Million M Dwarf Stars Characterized Using Domain-Adapted Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present fundamental atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) and metallicities ([M/H]) for 507,513 M dwarf stars using low-resolution spectra (R~1800) from LAMOST DR10. By employing Cycle-StarNet, an innovative domain adaptation approach, we successfully bridge the gap between theoretical PHOENIX synthetic spectra and observed LAMOST spectra, enabling parameter measurements even for lower signal-to-noise data (S/N&gt;5). The fitting residual analysis shows a reduction from 2.0 times to 1.68 times the flux uncertainty. Comparing with available literature values, we find systematic offsets and precisions of 12$\pm$70 K in Teff, -0.04$\pm$0.17 dex in log g, and -0.06$\pm$0.20 dex in [M/H]. The precision improves for higher quality spectra (S/N&gt;50) to 47 K, 0.12 dex, and 0.14 dex respectively. The metallicity consistency between wide binaries shows a scatter of 0.24 dex, improving to 0.15 dex at S/N&gt;50. We provide a comprehensive catalog including stellar parameters, spectral classifications, activity indicators, and binary/variability flags, establishing a resource for studies of the most numerous stellar population. The complete catalog is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14030249.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution and clustering properties of the young stellar populations in the Carina Nebula complex and Car OB1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry to analyze the spatial distribution of the young stellar populations and stellar clusters and to search for new OB star candidates in the Carina Nebula complex and the full extent of the Car OB1 association. We first performed a new census of high-mass stars in Car OB1 and compiled a comprehensive catalog of 517 stars with known spectral types that have Gaia DR3 parallaxes consistent with membership in the association. We applied the clustering algorithm DBSCAN on the Gaia data of the region to find stellar clusters, determine their distances and kinematics, and estimate ages. We also used Gaia astrometry and the additional astrophysical_parameters table to perform a spatially unbiased search for further high-mass members of Car OB1 over the full area of the association. Our DBSCAN analysis finds 15 stellar clusters and groups in Car OB1, four of which were not known before. Most clusters (80%) show signs of expansion or contraction, four of them with a &gt;2$\sigma$ significance. We find a global expansion of the Car OB1 association and a kinematic traceback of the high-mass stars shows that the spatial extent of the association was at a minimum 3-4 Myr ago. Using astrophysical parameters by Gaia DR3, we identified 15 new O-type and 589 new B-type star candidates in Car OB1. The majority (&gt;54%) of the high-mass stars constitute a non-clustered distributed stellar population. Based on our sample of high-mass stars, we estimate a total stellar population of at least ~8*10^4 stars in Car OB1. Our study is the first systematic astrometric analysis that covers the full spatial extent of the Car OB1 association, and it therefore substantially increases the knowledge of the distributed stellar population and spatial evolution of the entire association. Our results suggest suggests Car OB1 to be the most massive known star-forming complex in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>MAISTEP -- a new grid-based machine learning tool for inferring stellar parameters I. Ages of giant-planet host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of exoplanet demographics partly depends on their corresponding host star parameters. With the majority of exoplanet-host stars having only atmospheric constraints available, robust inference of their parameters is susceptible to the approach used. The goal of this work is to develop a grid-based machine learning tool capable of determining the stellar radius, mass, and age using only atmospheric constraints and to analyse the age distribution of stars hosting giant planets. Our machine learning approach involves combining four tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost) trained on a grid of stellar models to infer stellar radius, mass, and age using Teff, [Fe/H], and luminosities. We perform a detailed statistical analysis to compare the inferences of our tool with those based on seismic data from the APOKASC and LEGACY samples. Finally, we apply our tool to determine the ages of stars hosting giant planets. Comparing the stellar parameter inferences from our machine learning tool with those from the APOKASC and LEGACY, we find a bias (and a scatter) of -0.5\% (5\%) and -0.2\% (2\%) in radius, 6\% (5\%) per cent and -2\% (3\%) in mass, and -9\% (16\%) and 7\% (23\%) in age, respectively. Therefore, our machine learning predictions are commensurate with seismic inferences. When applying our model to a sample of stars hosting Jupiter-mass planets, we find the average age estimates for the hosts of Hot Jupiters, Warm Jupiters, and Cold Jupiters to be 1.98, 2.98, and 3.51 Gyr, respectively. These statistical ages of the host stars confirm previous predictions - based on stellar model ages for a relatively small number of hosts, as well as on the average age-velocity dispersion relation - that stars hosting Hot Jupiters are statistically younger than those hosting Warm and Cold Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Instabilities of the kinematic state of the atmospheres of some single C-rich post-AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To search for and study the instabilities in the atmospheres of selected post-AGB stars, we have performed a long-term high-resolution spectroscopy (R=60000) with the spectrograph NES of the 6-meter BTA telescope. Low-amplitude pulsations, splitting and/or asymmetry of the absorption profiles with a low excitation potential, as well as variability of a complex H$\alpha$ profile have been registered in the optical spectra of single stars associated with the IR sources IRASz02229+6208, IRAS 04296+3429, IRAS 07134+1005, IRAS 07430+1115, IRAS 19500-1709, IRAS 22223+4327, and IRAS 23304+6147 that had previously undergone the 3-d dredge-up. The maximum pulsation amplitude A$_{\rm Vr}$ was detected for the stars in the IRAS 07134+1005 and IRAS 19500-1709 systems, which have the maximum temperatures among the stars studied. Stratification of radial velocity in the atmosphere was found for two stars in the sample. The luminosity of the studied stars was estimated based on the intensity of the IR oxygen triplet OI(7774). Moreover, a luminosity of log${\rm (L/L_{\odot})}\approx$3.1 was obtained for the star in the IRAS 07430+1115 system within the typical values for post-AGB stars luminosity, which eliminates the paradox of the luminosity and the initial mass of this object.</description>

      <title>Granulation and Convectional Driving on Stellar Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface convection is important for the presence of magnetic activity at stars. So far, this convection is thought to be a result of heating from below, where convection cells rise and break up. New models reveal that surface convection is instead strongly driven by cooling from above. We compare two simulations of surface convection, one with a significant heating from below and one without. We obtain surface convection in both cases, and they show similar granulation patterns. The deep convection driven by heating from below is still evolving and asymptotically approaches a steady-state solution. We find that convection from below is not needed at all to form typical photospheric granulation. This indicates the possibility of a surface dynamo acting on stars without a convecting envelope. Even stars without a convecting envelope could therefore exhibit stronger magnetic and coronal activity than expected so far.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Balmer Line Emission Variability in M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M Dwarfs make up the majority of stars, offering an avenue for discovering exoplanets due to their smaller sizes. However, their magnetic activity poses challenges for exoplanet detection, characterization, and planetary habitability. Understanding its magnetic activity, including surface starspots and internal dynamos, is crucial for exoplanet research. In this study, we present short-term variability in four Balmer emission lines \ha, \hb, \hg, and \hd\ for a sample of 77 M dwarfs of varying spectral types, and binarity. Stars were observed using the MDM Observatory's Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph on the 2.4m Telescope and the Modular Spectrograph on the 1.3 m Telescope. These data are combined with TESS photometry to explore the connection between spectroscopic and photometric variability. We observe sporadic short-term variability in Balmer lines for some stars, on timescale $\gtrsim$ 15-min, but much shorter than the stellar rotation period. We calculate periods for stars lacking those measurements, re-evaluated the relationship between amplitude (\rvar)-activity relation for the \ha \ line from \citet{garcia_soto_contemporaneous_2023}, and extended our analysis to the \hb, \hg \ and \hd \ lines, which indicates that the relation becomes increasingly dispersed for higher-order Balmer lines. This is consistent with increased intrinsic variability from lower to higher order lines. Additionally, we compute the Balmer decrement, using \hb \ as the fiducial, for stars where we could measure \hg \ and/or \hd. The Balmer decrement can show distinct patterns during white-light flares, with significant differences even for the same star. We also find evidence for dark spots on \object{TIC 283866910}.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Super-Earth/Gas Giant Connection in Stellar Mass and Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants places strong constraints on formation theories. Building on previous work, Bryan $\&amp;$ Lee 2024 showed that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between super-Earths and outer gas giants around metal-rich FGK stars, and that this correlation disappears for metal-poor hosts. Here we consider how this connection evolves across stellar mass. Starting with our sample of 85 M-dwarfs ($&lt;$0.6 M$_{\odot}$) hosting inner super-Earths, we calculate P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$&gt;$0) = 9.4 (+10.2 -3.1)$\%$ and P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$\leq$0)$&lt;$3.1$\%$. Compared to the field gas giant frequency calculated from the Rosenthal et al 2021 sample, we find P(GG|[Fe/H]$&gt;$0) = 10.3 (+6.9 -3.1)$\%$, and P(GG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0)$&lt;$2.6$\%$ for M-dwarfs. While we see a higher gas giant frequency around metal-rich M-dwarfs for both samples, we find no significant correlations between super-Earths and gas giants. Combining our 85 M-dwarf sample with our FGK sample from Bryan $\&amp;$ Lee 2024, we resolve the SE/GG correlation in stellar mass (0.3--1.5 M$_{\odot}$) and metallicity. We show the positive correlation emerges in metal-rich K-dwarfs and strengthens with increasing stellar mass. Gas giant properties also impact the correlation -- for metal rich stars, the positive correlation is strengthened by: 1) dynamically hot gas giants for all stellar masses; 2) distant gas giants only for higher mass stars; and 3) single gas giants for K-dwarfs and multiple gas giants around more massive stars. We discuss how the stellar mass dependence of the inner-outer planet correlation can be understood from the increasing disk mass budget for higher mass stars.</description>

      <title>Mixing neutron star material into the jets in the common envelope jets supernova r-process scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I find that the accretion disk around the neutron star (NS) that enters the core of a massive evolved star in the frame of the common-envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can penetrate the crust of the NS, mix neutron-rich crust material into the disk, and enrich the jets that the disk launches with the neutron-rich material. As the NS accretes at high rates from the core inside which it revolves, it forms an accretion disk with high density. In the CEJSN r-process scenario, the very high density in the accretion disk results in low electron fraction gas, enabling the r-process. Jets carry the r-process elements out. The new claim in this study is that the high-density accretion disk destroys part of the NS crust and entrains this mass. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mixes material from the deeper crust. The total neutron-rich mass that the disk mixes and the jets carry can be up to ~0.01Mo. Enriching the accretion disk with neutron-rich material ensures a low electron fraction as required by the r-process nucleosynthesis and the ejection of massive r-process ejecta, ~0.01-0.03Mo. I strengthen the CEJSN r-process scenario but do not claim it is the main r-process site. I only claim that two or more r-process sites contribute to r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Dust Declines in R Coronae Borealis Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables are rare, hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants known for large, erratic declines in brightness due to dust formation. Recently, the number of known RCB stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds has increased from $\sim$30 to 162. We use all-sky and targeted photometric surveys to create the longest possible light curves for all known RCB stars and systematically study their declines. Our study, the largest of its kind, includes measurements of decline activity levels, morphologies, and periodicities for nearly all RCB stars. We confirm previous predictions that cool RCB stars exhibit more declines than warm RCBs, supporting a relationship between dust formation and condensation temperatures. We also find evidence for two distinct dust production mechanisms. R CrB and SU Tau show decline onsets consistent with a Poisson process, suggesting their dust production is driven by stochastic processes, such as convection. In contrast, RY Sgr's declines correlate with its pulsation period, suggesting that its dust production is driven by pulsationally-induced shocks. Finally, we show that the dust properties of the related class of DY~Per variables differ from those of the RCB stars, suggesting differences in their evolutionary status.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>Mergers of compact objects with cores of massive stars: evolutionary pathways, r-process nucleosynthesis and multi-messenger signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might result in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact object-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrino and gravitational-wave (GW) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Small Planets with High Mutual Inclinations are more Common around Metal-Rich Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a correlation between the stellar metallicities and the mutual inclinations of multi-planet systems hosting short-period small planets (a/Rs&lt;12, Rp&lt;4Re). We analyzed 89 multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler, K2, and TESS, where the innermost planets have periods shorter than 10 days. We found that the mutual inclinations of the innermost two planets are higher and more diverse around metal-rich stars. The mutual inclinations are calculated as the absolute differences between the best-fit inclinations of the innermost two planets from transit modeling, which represent the lower limits of the true mutual inclinations. The mean and variance of the mutual inclination distribution of the metal-rich systems are 3.1+-0.5 and 3.1+-0.4 degrees, while for the metal-poor systems they are 1.3+-0.2 and 1.0+-0.2 degrees. This finding suggests that inner planetary systems around metal-rich stars are dynamically hotter. We summarized the theories that could plausibly explain this correlation, including the influence of giant planets, higher solid densities in protoplanetary disks around metal-rich stars, or secular chaos coupled with an excess of angular momentum deficits. Planet formation and population synthesis models tracking the mutual inclination evolution would be essential to fully understand this correlation.</description>

      <title>Deriving pulsar pair-production multiplicities from pulsar wind nebulae using H.E.S.S. and LHAASO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) dominate the galactic gamma-ray sky at very high energies, and are major contributors to the leptonic cosmic ray flux. However, whether or not pulsars also accelerate ions to comparable energies is not yet experimentally confirmed. We aim to constrain the birth period and pair-production multiplicity for a set of pulsars. In doing so, we aim to constrain the proportion of ions in the pulsar magnetosphere and hence the proportion of ions that could enter the pulsar wind. We estimate possible ranges of the value of the average pair production multiplicity for a sample of 26 pulsars in the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalogue, which have also been observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. We then derive lower limits for the pulsar birth periods and average pair production multiplicities for a subset of these sources where the extent of the pulsar wind nebula and surrounding supernova shell have been measured in the radio. We also derive curves for the average pair production multiplicities as a function of birth period for sources recently observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We show that there is a potential for hadrons entering the pulsar wind for most of the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO sources we consider, dependent upon the efficiency of luminosity conversion into particles. We also present estimates of the pulsar birth period for six of these sources, which all fall into the range of $\simeq$10-50 ms.</description>

      <title>The Membership and Age of the Planet-hosting Young Star IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus star-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known planets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one based on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study for a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North). However, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most temperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the observed sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr). Meanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field stars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations, so its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS 04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds (B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32 Ori. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes, but the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that &gt;M4 stars at ages of &lt;10 Myr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one member of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of 3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by happenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model isochrones.</description>
