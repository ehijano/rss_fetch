      <title>Analogue of Feigin's map on $\imath$quantum group of split type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (universal) $\imath$quantum groups are as a vast generalization of (Drinfeld double) quantum groups. We establish an algebra homomorphism from universal $\imath$quantum group of split type to a certain quantum torus, which can be viewed as an $\imath$analogue of Feigin's map on the quantum group.</description>

      <title>Nondegenerate module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the work of Shimizu (2019), various nondegeneracy conditions for braided finite tensor categories are equivalent. This theory is partially extended to braided module categories here. We introduce when a braided module category is "nondegenerate" and "factorizable", and establish that these properties are equivalent. The proof involves a new monadicity result for module categories. Lastly, we examine the Hopf case, using Kolb's (2020) notion of a quasitriangular comodule algebra to introduce "factorizable" comodule algebras. We then show that the representation category of a quasitriangular comodule algebra is nondegenerate in our sense precisely when the comodule algebra is factorizable. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Local topological order and boundary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$, which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Ann. H. Poincar\'e 25, 2024] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\rm{II}$, and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\rm{III}$. Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Bicategories of 2-fold Segal Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the construction of homotopy bicategories of $(\infty,2)$-categories, which we take as being modeled by 2-fold Segal spaces. Our main result is the concrete construction of a functor $h_2$ from the category of Reedy fibrant $2$-fold Segal spaces (each decorated with chosen sections of the Segal maps) to the category of unbiased bicategories and pseudofunctors between them. Though our construction depends on the choice of sections, we show that for a given $2$-fold Segal space, all possible choices yield the same unbiased bicategory up to an equivalence that acts as the identity on objects, morphisms and $2$-morphisms. We illustrate our results with the example of the fundamental bigroupoid of a topological space.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize some results in our previous work on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>Gauge Origami and BPS/CFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\times \mathbb{C}^{4}$ and its BPS/CFT correspondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system arise from D0-branes bound to D$(2p)$-branes wrapping cycles in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is understood as an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten index of it produces the instanton partition function. We define a $q$-deformed quiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and introduce vertex operators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral formula for the Witten index has a nice free field realization. Such free field realization leads to the concept of BPS $qq$-characters or BPS quiver W-algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>
