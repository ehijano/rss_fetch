      <title>Graph Coloring Below Guarantees via Co-Triangle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the $\ell$-Coloring Problem, we are given a graph on $n$ nodes, and tasked with determining if its vertices can be properly colored using $\ell$ colors. In this paper we study below-guarantee graph coloring, which tests whether an $n$-vertex graph can be properly colored using $g-k$ colors, where $g$ is a trivial upper bound such as $n$. We introduce an algorithmic framework that builds on a packing of co-triangles $\overline{K_3}$ (independent sets of three vertices): the algorithm greedily finds co-triangles and employs a win-win analysis. If many are found, we immediately return YES; otherwise these co-triangles form a small co-triangle modulator, whose deletion makes the graph co-triangle-free.
  Extending the work of [Gutin et al., SIDMA 2021], who solved $\ell$-Coloring (for any $\ell$) in randomized $O^*(2^{k})$ time when given a $\overline{K_2}$-free modulator of size $k$, we show that this problem can likewise be solved in randomized $O^*(2^{k})$ time when given a $\overline{K_3}$-free modulator of size~$k$.
  This result in turn yields a randomized $O^{*}(2^{3k/2})$ algorithm for $(n-k)$-Coloring (also known as Dual Coloring), improving the previous $O^{*}(4^{k})$ bound. We then introduce a smaller parameterization, $(\omega+\overline{\mu}-k)$-Coloring, where $\omega$ is the clique number and $\overline{\mu}$ is the size of a maximum matching in the complement graph; since $\omega+\overline{\mu}\le n$ for any graph, this problem is strictly harder. Using the same co-triangle-packing argument, we obtain a randomized $O^{*}(2^{6k})$ algorithm, establishing its fixed-parameter tractability for a smaller parameter. Complementing this finding, we show that no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm exists for $(\omega-k)$-Coloring or $(\overline{\mu}-k)$-Coloring under standard complexity assumptions.</description>

      <title>The Power Contamination Problem on Grids Revisited: Optimality, Combinatorics, and Links to Integer Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a combinatorial study of the power contamination problem, a dynamic variant of power domination modeled on grid graphs. We resolve a conjecture posed by Ainouche and Bouroubi (2021) by proving it is false and instead establish the exact value of the power contamination number on grid graphs. Furthermore, we derive recurrence relations for this number and initiate the enumeration of optimal contamination sets. We prove that the number of optimal solutions for specific grid families corresponds to well-known integer sequences, including those counting ternary words with forbidden subwords and the large Schr\"oder numbers. This work settles the fundamental combinatorial questions of the power contamination problem on grids and reveals its rich connections to classical combinatorics.</description>

      <title>An involution for trivariate symmetries of vincular patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a bijective proof of the equidistribution of two pairs of vincular patterns in permutations, thereby resolving a recent open problem of Bitonti, Deb, and Sokal (arXiv:2412.10214). Since the bijection is involutive, we also confirm their conjecture on the equidistribution of triple vincular patterns. Somewhat unexpectedly, we show that this involution is closed on the set of Baxter permutations, thereby implying another trivariate symmetries of vincular patterns. The proof of this second result requires a variant of a characterization of Baxter permutations in terms of restricted Laguerre histories, first given by Viennot using the Fran\c{c}on-Viennot bijection.</description>

      <title>The Converse of the Real Orthogonal Holant Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Holant theorem is a powerful tool for studying the computational complexity of counting problems in the Holant framework. Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of symmetric tensors.</description>

      <title>Equitable coloring of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An equitable coloring of a graph is a proper coloring where the sizes of any two distinct color classes differ by at most one. The celebrated Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture (CLWC for short) states that every connected graph $G$ that is neither an odd cycle, a $K_r$, nor a $K_{2m+1,2m+1}$ has an equitable $\Delta(G)$-coloring. A graph $G$ is in $\mathcal{G}_{m_1,m_2}$ if for all $H\subseteq G$, $\lVert H \rVert\leq m_1|H|$, and if $H$ is bipartite, then $\lVert H \rVert\leq m_2|H|$. In this paper, we confirm CLWC for all graphs $G$ in $\mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ provided that $m_1\leq 1.8m_2$ and $\Delta(G)\geq \frac{2m_1}{1-\beta}$, where $\beta$ is a real root of $2m_2(1-x)(1+x)^2-m_1x(2+x)$. By specializing to the case $m_1 = m_2 = d$, we deduce that every $d$-degenerate graph $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 6.21d$ admits an equitable $r$-coloring for all $r \geq \Delta(G)$, thereby improving the previous best-known lower bound of $10d$ on $\Delta(G)$ established by Kostochka and Nakprasit in 2005. A graph is $k$-planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that each edge is crossed at most $k$ times. CLWC had been confirmed for planar graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 8$ (Kostochka, Lin, and Xiang, 2024) and for $1$-planar graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 13$ (Cranston and Mahmoud, 2025). As an immediate application of our main result, we extend this confirmation to all $k$-planar graphs $G$ with $k \geq 2$ and $\Delta(G) \geq \sqrt{383k}$.</description>

      <title>Parameterised algorithms for temporally satisfying reconfiguration problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporally satisfying reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph at each time-step.
  We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input temporal graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.</description>
