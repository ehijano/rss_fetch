      <title>Light Scalar Fields Foster Production of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields are ubiquitous in theories of high-energy physics. In the context of cosmic inflation, this suggests the existence of spectator fields, which provide a subdominant source of energy density. We show that spectator fields boost the inflationary production of primordial black holes, with single-field ultra-slow roll evolution supplanted by a phase of evolution along the spectator direction, and primordial perturbations amplified by the resulting multifield dynamics. This generic mechanism is largely free from the severe fine-tuning that afflicts single-field inflationary PBH models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the epoch of reionisation with Planck PR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epoch of reionisation is a key phase in the cosmic history, characterised by the ionisation of the intergalactic medium by the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the reionisation history of the Universe using data from the cosmic microwave background, more specifically the latest Planck dataset (Public Data Release 4, PR4). We investigate a wide range of reionisation models, from simple parametric descriptions to more flexible non-parametric approaches, systematically evaluating their impact on the inferred constraints. Special attention is given to implicit priors introduced by each model and their influence on the derived reionisation optical depth $\tau$. To achieve this, we employ both Bayesian and frequentist methods to derive robust constraints. We obtain consistent estimates of $\tau$ across models, highlighting the robustness of the constraints on the integrated optical depth derived from Planck PR4 data. The posterior mean averaged across models is $\tau = 0.0576 \pm 0.0060$, while the average best-fit value, $\tau = 0.0581$, reflects the presence of small volume effects. Based on our analysis, we estimate that an additional uncertainty, associated with the modelling of reionisation, contributes an error of approximately $\sigma_\tau\!\sim\!0.0006$. Beyond the integrated optical depth, our analysis reveals that the inferred ionisation fraction as a function of redshift is highly model-dependent. While current CMB data do not favour significant early ionisation, they are consistent with a modest contribution from ionised gas at very early times ($z&gt;15$). Although indicative upper bounds can be placed on such contributions, these limits remain strongly dependent on the assumed model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts and The Star Formation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological evolution of the luminosity and redshift of FRBs. As is the case for all extragalactic sources, we are dealing with data that are truncated by observational selection effects, the most important being the flux limit, which introduces the so-called Eddington-Malmquist bias. In addition, for FRBs, there is a significant uncertainty in the redshifts obtained from the observed dispersion measures. To correct for the truncation we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron- Petrosian and Lynden-Bell methods, which give unbiased distributions of luminosities and redshifts and their cosmological evolution. To quantify the redshift uncertainty, we use a data set, which in addition to a mean redshift, gives the one-sigma errors. We construct three samples with lower, mean, and upper redshifts and apply the above methods to each. For the three samples, we find similar (1) &gt; 2.5{\sigma} evidence for luminosity evolution, (2) a luminosity function that can be fit by a simple broken power law, and (3) a comoving density formation rate that decreases rapidly with redshift unlike the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). This rate is similar to that of short gamma-ray bursts, which are believed to result from compact star mergers with a formation rate delayed relative to the SFR. This may further support the hypothesis that magnetars are the progenitors of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

      <title>Estimating constraints on cosmological parameters via the canonical and the differential redshift drift with SKA HI 21-cm observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redshift drift effect, an observational probe that indenpendent of cosmological models, presents unique applications in specific cosmological epoch. By quantifying redshift drift signal , researchers can determine the rate of the Universe's accelerated expansion and impose constraints on cosmological models and parameters. This study evaluates the precision in cosmological parameters estimation derived from this signal via HI 21cm signal, that observed by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, with spectral resolutions of 0.001 Hz and 0.002 Hz over an observational period of $\Delta T = 0.5$ year, utilizing two established techniques: the canonical redshift drift and the differential redshift drift method. The primary objective of this project is to ascertain the rate of cosmic acceleration and establish a solid foundation for real-time cosmology. The results reveal that both the two methods impose highly precise constraints on cosmological parameters, with accuracy reaching the level of millimeter per second (mm/s) or better. However, the canonical method provides relatively less stringent compared to the differential approach. Furthermore, when solely constraining the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$, the strategy can be adapted to the canonical method. Nonetheless, the differential method exhibits clear advantages when simultaneously constraining the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the equation of state of dark energy. These findings validate SKA's capability in detecting redshift drift and refining observational cosmology and indicates the effect can offer superior diagnostic capabilities compared to other techniques, provided that appropriate observational equipment or sufficient observational time is employed.</description>

      <title>Naturally Resonant Dark Matter from Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00076v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the mass resonance structure that naturally arises from extra-dimensional models. The resonance can enhance the dark matter annihilation as well as self-interaction. We demonstrate such a resonance structure by considering the fermionic dark matter and dark photon models on an $S^1/(Z_2 \times Z_2')$ orbifold. We also note that this model embeds dark matter axial vector coupling to the dark photon, which opens up the viable dark matter parameter space. We then present the unique predictions for direct-detection experiments and accelerator searches.</description>

      <title>Darkness in the Crust: Searching for the truly "Dark" Subhalos with Paleo-detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos are pivotal in understanding the small-scale structure of the universe, thereby offering a sensitive method to discriminate between different cosmological models. In this study, we estimate the local number density of cold DM subhalos in the solar neighborhood, and demonstrate that their sparse distribution makes their detection via direct detection experiments highly improbable. However, it is plausible to expect that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of subhalos could be detected by Paleo-detectors, a proposed new technique to look for DM by reading out damage tracks left by past DM interactions in minerals, due to their extended exposure times. Hence, we explore how Paleo-detectors can serve as effective probes for the properties of low-mass subhalos, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^8) M_{\odot}$. We find that Paleo-detectors might be able to constrain certain regions of the subhalo mass-concentration relation (for subhalo masses of $10-10^4 M_\odot$ if DM has a mass of $\sim5$GeV). This is a new and complementary type of study that seeks to combine information from the particle nature of DM to that of small scale structures.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Dark Matter from the String Theory Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose heavy axions as a natural superheavy dark matter candidate in string theory, with the relic density of dark matter originating in quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation. String Theory is well known for the possibility of having tens to hundreds of axion-like particles -- the axiverse. Moduli stabilization generates high-scale masses for many of these, placing them naturally in the superheavy regime of particle physics. We consider moduli stabilization in the KKLT framework, featuring a single volume modulus and $C_4$ axion, and a fiducial inflation model minimally coupled to the volume modulus. We demonstrate that both the volume modulus and the axion can be abundantly produced through gravitational particle production. The former is unstable and readily decays to Standard Model particles while the latter (the axion) can be stable and survives to constitute the present day dark matter.</description>

      <title>A species scale-driven breakdown of effective field theory in time-dependent string backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way in which effective field theory (EFT) can break down in cosmological string backgrounds depending on the behavior of the quantum gravity cutoff in infinite distance limits, known as the species scale $\Lambda_s$. Namely, EFT can break down if the species scale $\Lambda_s$ falls off so rapidly as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor grows from some initial value $a_i$ to some final value $a_f$ that the physical momentum of an initial Hubble-sized perturbation $\sim H_i^{-1}$ grows to exceed the species scale. For EFT to remain valid, a new condition $H_i \frac{a_i}{a_f} \ll \Lambda_{s,f}$ must hold, which is distinct from Trans-Planckian conditions discussed in the literature. Using the universal relation $\frac{\nabla m}{m} \cdot \frac{\nabla \Lambda_s}{\Lambda_s} = \frac{1}{d-2}$ in the infinite distance limits of moduli space where $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower and $\nabla$ measures variations with respect to the canonical metric on moduli space, we show that spatially flat FRW solutions in the string landscape violate this condition or at best marginally satisfy it. However, we find that sufficiently large negative spatial curvature always avoids a breakdown. To avoid EFT breakdown, we derive an upper bound on the duration of quasi-de Sitter expansion that classically evolves to decelerated expansion. Our bound is proportional to the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) bound, with the advantage that it applies to any FRW solution in the string landscape. Finally, we distinguish EFT breakdown from TCC violation, the latter being a quantum gravity constraint rather than an EFT limitation. Perhaps our most surprising finding is that in any flat FRW solution that develops a weakly coupled string at future infinity the EFT inevitably breaks down.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical states on galaxy clusters populations. II. Comparison of galaxy properties and fundamental relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution. The role of cluster dynamical states in shaping the physical and morphological properties of member galaxies remains an open question. We aim to assess the impact of the dynamical state of massive ($M_{500} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters on the physical and structural properties of their member galaxies, and also in their fundamental relations in the redshift range $0.10 &lt; z &lt; 0.35$. We use a mass-matched sample of galaxies from relaxed and disturbed clusters. Morphological types are assigned using both parametric and non-parametric methods, while physical properties are derived through SED fitting. Galaxies are further divided into subpopulations to investigate trends with cluster dynamical states. The dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not alter their fundamental relations at low redshift (such as color-magnitude, mass-size, morphology-density, and SF-density relations), nor does it significantly affect the mean or dispersion of galaxy properties. However, it does impact the distributions at the level of third and fourth order moments, introducing asymmetries and heavier tails in the properties of galaxies. The greatest effects are observed in low-mass and red sequence galaxies. These findings suggest that, at low redshift, the fundamental relations of massive galaxy clusters are already well-established and resilient to recent dynamical activity. Nonetheless, the influence of the dynamical state on the higher-order moments of galaxy properties indicates that environmental processes associated with disturbed clusters still leave measurable imprints, particularly on low-mass and red sequence galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that galaxy evolution is shaped both by early pre-processing and by subsequent interactions within dynamically active environments.</description>

      <title>Q-balls Under Spontaneously Broken U(1) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of Q-balls under a spontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry. Q-balls are stabilized by the conservation of $U(1)$ charge, but when the symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson can carry charge away from the Q-ball, potentially leading to charge leakage. To study this process in a controlled setting, we consider a scenario where Q-balls first form under an unbroken $U(1)$ symmetry, which is then spontaneously broken. We introduce two complex scalar fields: one responsible for forming the Q-ball, and the other for spontaneously breaking the $U(1)$ symmetry, allowing us to clearly separate the formation and symmetry-breaking phases. Using numerical simulations in a spherically symmetric system, we find that the evolution of Q-balls depends sensitively on the structure of the interaction between the two fields and the magnitude of symmetry breaking. Depending on parameters, Q-balls can completely decay, evaporate into smaller, stable Q-balls, or transition into oscillons/I-balls. In particular, we find that stable, localized remnants often survive the evolution over long timescales, especially when the symmetry-breaking scale is small. These results demonstrate that, even though spontaneous $U(1)$ breaking can lead to significant energy and charge loss from Q-balls, stable localized objects with reduced or no charge can frequently survive and potentially contribute to cosmological relics.</description>

      <title>Decay rate of PQ-ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons that arise in theories with a complex scalar field possessing a conserved global U(1) charge. Their stability is ensured by this charge, making them potentially significant in cosmology. In this paper, we investigate Q-ball-like objects in scenarios where the scalar field acquires a finite vacuum expectation value, spontaneously breaking the global U(1) symmetry. A well-motivated example is the Peccei-Quinn field, where the U(1) symmetry is identified as the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, and hence we refer to such objects as PQ-balls. We first discuss the existence of stable PQ-ball solutions in a finite-density plasma and argue that they become unstable in vacuum. Using detailed numerical simulations under spherical symmetry, we confirm their formation, compute their decay rate, and derive an analytical formula for it. Our results have important implications for axion cosmology, particularly in the context of the kinetic misalignment mechanism.</description>

      <title>A two-step strategy to identify episodic sources of gravitational waves and high energy neutrinos in starburst galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole mergers with spin-flips accelerate energetic particles through their precessing relativistic jets, producing high energy neutrinos and finally gravitational waves. In star formation massive stars come in pairs, triplets and quadruplets, allowing second generation mergers of the remnants with discrepant spin directions. The Gravitational Wave (GW) data support such a scenario. Earlier we suggested that stellar mass black hole mergers (visible in M82) with an associated spin-flip analogously allow the acceleration of energetic particles, with ensuing high energy neutrinos and high energy photons, and finally producing gravitational waves. At cosmic distances only the gravitational waves and the neutrinos remain detectable. Here we generalize the argument to starburst and normal galaxies throughout their cosmic evolution, and show that these galaxies may dominate over Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the flux of ultra-high energy particles observed at Earth. All these sources contribute to the cosmic neutrino background, as well as the gravitational wave background (they detected the lower frequencies). We outline a search strategy to find such episodic sources, which requires to include both luminosity and flux density.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall dynamics from nonequilibrium quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled dynamics between the bubble wall and the plasma from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. The commonly used equation of motion of the bubble wall in the kinetic approach is shown to be incomplete. In the language of the two-particle-irreducible effective action, the conventional equation misses higher-loop terms generated by the condensate-particle type vertices (e.g.,~$\varphi\phi\chi^2$, where $\varphi$ is the background field describing the bubble wall, $\phi$ the corresponding particle excitation and $\chi$ another particle species in the plasma). From the missing terms, we identify an additional dissipative friction which is contributed by particle production processes from the condensate-particle type vertices. We also show how other transmission processes beyond the 1-to-1 elementary transmission studied in the literature for ultrarelativistic bubble walls, e.g., 1-to-1 mixing and 1-to-2 transition radiation, can be understood from the kinetic approach.</description>

      <title>Homology reveals significant anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test the tenet of statistical isotropy of the standard cosmological model via a homology analysis of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps. Examining small sectors of the normalized maps, we find that the results exhibit a dependence on whether we compute the mean and variance locally from the masked patch, or from the full masked sky. Assigning local mean and variance for normalization, we find the maximum discrepancy between the data and model in the galactic northern hemisphere at more than $3.5$ s.d. for the PR4 dataset at degree-scale. For the PR3 dataset, the C-R and SMICA maps exhibit higher significance than the PR4 dataset at $\sim 4$ and $4.1$ s.d. respectively, however the NILC and SEVEM maps exhibit lower significance at $\sim 3.4$ s.d. The southern hemisphere exhibits high degree of consistency between the data and the model for both the PR4 and PR3 datasets. Assigning the mean and variance of the full masked sky decreases the significance for the northern hemisphere, the tails in particular. However the tails in the southern hemisphere are strongly discrepant at more than $4$ standard deviations at approximately $5$ degrees. The $p$-values obtained from the $\chi^2$-statistic exhibit commensurate significance in both the experiments. Examining the quadrants of the sphere, we find the first quadrant to be the major source of the discrepancy. Prima-facie, the results indicate a breakdown of statistical isotropy in the CMB maps, however more work is needed to ascertain the source of the anomaly. Regardless, these map characteristics may have serious consequences for downstream computations such as parameter estimation, and the related Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Reducing nuisance prior sensitivity via non-linear reparameterization, with application to EFT analyses of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical models contain nuisance parameters that quantify unknown properties of an experiment that are not of primary relevance. Typically, these cannot be measured except by fitting the models to the data from the experiment, requiring simultaneous measurement of interesting parameters that are our target of inference and nuisance terms that are not directly of interest. A recent example of this is fitting Effective Field Theory (EFT) models to large-scale structure (LSS) data to make cosmological inferences. These models have a large number of nuisance parameters that are typically correlated with cosmological parameters in the posterior, leading to strong dependence on the nuisance parameter priors. We introduce a reparametrization method that leverages Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to decorrelate nuisance parameters from the parameters of interest in the likelihood, even in the presence of non-linear relationships. This reparametrization forms a natural basis within which to define priors that are independent between nuisance and target parameters: the separation means that the marginal posterior for cosmological parameters does not depend on simple priors placed on nuisance terms. In application to EFT models using LSS data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to robust cosmological inference.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity of Tensor Induced Density Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussianity of second-order matter density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (GWs). These tensor-induced scalar modes arise from local fluctuations in the GWs energy density, which is quadratic in tensor perturbations. The resulting second-order density contrast follows a chi-squared distribution, naturally exhibiting significant non-Gaussianity. We compute the bispectrum of these tensor-induced scalar modes and analyze its dependence on various primordial GWs power spectra, including scale-invariant, blue-tilted, Gaussian-bump, and monochromatic sources. We find that the bispectrum shape is inherently sensitive to the underlying GWs spectrum by construction. In particular, Gaussian-bump and monochromatic sources produce a strong signal peaking in the equilateral configuration, similar to the effect of scalar-induced tensor modes. Our findings reveal a new way to probe primordial GWs via galaxy surveys and highlight a unique feature of tensor-induced density perturbations, otherwise mimicking linear ones on sub-horizon scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Forecast measurement of the 21 cm global spectrum from Lunar orbit with the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic 21 cm signal serves as a crucial probe for studying the evolutionary history of the Universe. However, detecting the 21 cm signal poses significant challenges due to its extremely faint nature. To mitigate the interference from the Earth's radio frequency interference (RFI), the ground and the ionospheric effects, the Discovering the Sky at the Longest Wavelength (DSL) project will deploy a constellation of satellites in Lunar orbit, with its high-frequency daughter satellite tasked with detecting the global 21 cm signal from cosmic dawn and reionization era (CD/EoR). We intend to employ the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) for foreground fitting and subtracting. We have studied the effect of thermal noise, thermal radiation from the Moon, the Lunar reflection, anisotropic frequency-dependent beam, inaccurate antenna beam pattern, and RFI contamination. We discovered that the RFI contamination can significantly affect the fitting process and thus prevent us from detecting the signal. Therefore, experimenting on the far side of the moon is crucial. We also discovered that using VZOP together with DSL, after 1080 orbits around the Moon, which takes about 103 days, we can successfully detect the CD/EoR 21 cm signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the background and perturbations in $k$-essence inflation models and show that a general $k$-essence exhibits a simple scaling property. In particular, we study two classes of $k$-inflation models with the potential characterized by an inflection point. We demonstrate that these models enjoy scaling properties that could be used to redefine input parameters so that the perturbation spectra satisfy correct normalization at the CMB pivot scale. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models.</description>
