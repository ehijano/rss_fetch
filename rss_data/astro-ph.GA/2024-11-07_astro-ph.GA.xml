      <title>An updated catalogue of 310 Galactic supernova remnants and their statistical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A revised catalogue of 310 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is presented, along with some statistics of their properties. 21 SNRs have been added to the catalogue since the previous published version from 2019, and 5 entries have been removed, as they have been identified as HII regions. Also discussed are some basics statistics of the remnants in the catalogue, the selection effects that apply to the identification of Galactic SNRs and their consequences.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots at an Inflection Point: Ubiquitous "V-Shaped" Turnover Consistently Occurs at the Balmer Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are "Little Red Dots" -- compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines and, in many cases, exhibit a "V shaped" change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this "V shape". By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red H$\alpha$ emitters at $2&lt;z&lt;6$ exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit ($0.3645$ $\mu$m). Using a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light component, we demonstrate that the observed "V shape" in Little Red Dots is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by evolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little Red Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the rest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated with $T\sim10^4$ K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at H$_\infty$.</description>

      <title>The GECKOS Survey: Identifying kinematic sub-structures in edge-on galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical evolution of galactic discs is governed by the sub-structures within them. We examine the diversity of kinematic sub-structure present in the first 12 galaxies observed from the GECKOS survey, a VLT/MUSE large programme providing a systematic study of 35 edge-on, Milky Way-mass disc galaxies. Employing the nGIST analysis pipeline, we derive the mean line-of-sight stellar velocity ($V_{\star}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\star}$), skew ($h_{3}$), and kurtosis ($h_{4}$) for the sample, and examine 2D maps and 1D line profiles. Visually, the majority of this sample (8/12) are found to possess boxy-peanut bulges and host the corresponding kinematic structure predicted for stellar bars viewed in projection. Four galaxies exhibit strong evidence for the presence of nuclear discs, including central $h_{3}$-$V_{\star}$ anti-correlations, `croissant'-shaped central depressions in $\sigma_{\star}$ maps, strong gradients in $h_{3}$, and positive $h_{4}$ plateaus over the expected nuclear disc extent. The strength of the $h_{3}$ feature corresponds to the size of the nuclear disc, measured from the $h_{3}$ turnover radius. We can explain the features within the kinematic maps of all sample galaxies via disc structure(s) alone. We do not find any need to invoke the existence of dispersion-dominated bulges. Obtaining the specialised data products for this paper and the broader GECKOS survey required significant development of existing integral field spectroscopic (IFS) analysis tools. Therefore, we also present the nGIST pipeline: a modern, sophisticated, and easy-to-use pipeline for the analysis of galaxy IFS data. We conclude that the variety of kinematic sub-structures seen in GECKOS galaxies requires a contemporary view of galaxy morphology, expanding on the traditional view of galaxy structure, and uniting the kinematic complexity observed in the Milky Way with the extragalactic.</description>

      <title>Kilogauss magnetic field and jet dynamics in the quasar NRAO 530</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of the Event Horizon Telescope has enabled the study of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei down to sub-parsec linear scales even at high redshift. Quasi-simultaneous multifrequency observations provide insights into the physical conditions in compact regions and allow testing accretion theories. Initially we aimed at measuring the magnetic field strength close to the central supermassive black hole in NRAO 530 (1730-130) by studying frequency-dependent opacity of the jet matter, Faraday rotation and the spectral index in the mm-radio bands. NRAO 530 was observed quasi-simultaneously at 15, 22, 43, 86, and 227 GHz at four different very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) networks. By the means of imaging and model-fitting, we aligned the images, taken at different frequencies. We explored opacity along the jet and distribution of the linearly polarized emission in it. Our findings reveal that the jet of NRAO 530 at 86 and 227 GHz is transparent down to its origin, with 70 mJy emission detected at 227 GHz potentially originating from the accretion disk. The magnetic field strength near the black hole, estimated at $5r_\mathrm{g}$, is $3\times10^3-3\times10^4$ G (depending on the central black hole mass). These values represent some of the highest magnetic field strengths reported for active galaxies. We also report the first ever VLBI measurement of the Faraday rotation at 43-227 GHz, which reveals rotation measure values as high as -48000 rad/m2 consistent with higher particle density and stronger magnetic fields at the jet's outset. The complex shape of the jet in NRAO 530 is in line with the expected behavior of a precessing jet, with a period estimated to be around $6\pm4$~years.</description>

      <title>ALMA detection of [OIII] 88um at z=12.33: Exploring the Nature and Evolution of GHZ2 as a Massive Compact Stellar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA observations on the high-redshift galaxy GHZ2 and report a successful detection of the rest-frame 88um atomic transition from doubly-ionized Oxygen at z=12.3327+/-0.0005. Based on these observations, combined with additional constraints on the [OIII] 52um line luminosity and previous JWST data, we argue that GHZ2 is likely powered by compact and young star formation, and show that it follows well-established relationships found for giant HII regions and metal-poor star-forming dwarf galaxies that are known to host bright super star clusters. Additionally, these observations provide new constraints on the Oxygen electron density (100 &lt; n_e[cm^-3] &lt; 4,000) and dynamical mass (M_dyn=3-8x10^8M_sun). The existence of these massive starburst systems 13.3Gyr ago might explain the origin of today's globular clusters, a long-standing question in astronomy. To test this, we present observational probes to investigate whether sources like GHZ2 are linked to the formation of today's globular clusters or other more massive compact stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Binary Nature of NGC 2323</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a well-known open cluster, NGC 2323 (also called M50) has been widely investigated for over a hundred years and has always been considered a classical single cluster. In this work, with the help of Gaia DR3, we study the binary structure nature of this cluster. Although indistinguishable in the spatial space, the small but undeniable difference in the proper motion indicates that they may be two individual clusters. After investigating the properties of the two clusters, it is found that they have very close positions (three-dimensional $\Delta$pos = 12.3 pc, $\sigma_{\Delta \mathrm{pos}} = 3.4$ pc) and similar tangential velocities (two-dimensional $\Delta$V = 2.2 km s$^{-1}$, $\sigma_{\Delta \mathrm{V}} = 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$), indicating the existence of their physical association. Moreover, the best isochrone fitting ages of the two clusters are the same (158 Myr), further proving their possibly common origin. To comprehensively understand the formation and evolution of this binary cluster, we employ the PETAR $N$-body code to trace back their birthplace and deduce their dynamical evolutionary fate. With observational mean cluster properties, the simulations suggest that they may form together, and then orbit each other as a binary cluster for over 200 Myr. After that, because of their gradual mass loss, the two clusters will eventually separate and evolve into two independent clusters. Meanwhile, the numerical $N$-body simulation suggests that the less massive cluster is unlikely to be the cluster tidal tails created by the differential rotation of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>From Particles to Pixels: How many particles do I really need to construct stellar kinematic mock observational measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the impact of resolution in the construction of mock observations of simulated galaxies. In particular, when building mock integral field spectroscopic observations from galaxy formation models in cosmological simulations, we investigate the possible systematics that may arise given the assumption that all galaxies above some stellar mass limit will provide unbiased and meaningful observable stellar kinematics. We build a catalogue of N-body simulations to sample the range of stellar particle resolutions within the EAGLE Ref0050N0752 simulation box and examine how their observable kinematics vary relative to a higher-resolution N-body control. We use these models to compile a table of the minimum number of particles-per-pixel to reach a given uncertainty in the fitted line-of-sight velocity distribution parameters. Further, we introduce a Voronoi-binning module to the mock observation code, SimSpin, in order to meet these minimum numbers. Using EAGLE, we show the impact of this shot noise on the observed spin-ellipticity plane and the recovery of this space when observations are binned with increasing numbers of particles. In conclusion, we advise binning mock images to meet at least 200 particles-per-pixel to avoid systematically under-estimating the velocity dispersion along a given line-of-sight. We demonstrate that this is important for comparing galaxies extracted from the same simulation, as well as between simulations of varying mass resolution and observations of real galaxies.</description>

      <title>Modelling of long gamma-ray burst host galaxies at cosmic noon from damped Lyman-{\alpha} absorption statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of long gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies using a statistical modelling framework derived to model damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) in quasar spectra at high redshift. The distribution of NHI for GRB-DLAs is $\sim$10 times higher than what is found for quasar-DLAs at similar impact parameters. We interpret this as a temporal selection effect due to the short-lived GRB progenitor probing its host at the onset of a starburst where the interstellar medium may exhibit multiple overdense regions. Owing to the larger NHI, the dust extinction is larger with 29 per cent of GRB-DLAs exhibiting A(V)&gt;1 mag in agreement with the fraction of 'dark bursts'. Despite the differences in NHI distributions, we find that high-redshift 2 &lt; z &lt; 3 quasar- and GRB-DLAs trace the luminosity function of star-forming host galaxies in the same way. We propose that their differences may arise from the fact that the galaxies are sampled at different times in their star formation histories, and that the absorption sightlines probe the galaxy haloes differently. Quasar-DLAs sample the full H I cross-section, whereas GRB-DLAs sample only regions hosting cold neutral medium. Previous studies have found that GRBs avoid high-metallicity galaxies ($\sim$0.5 $Z_{\odot}$). Since at these redshifts galaxies on average have lower metallicities, our sample is only weakly sensitive to such a threshold. Lastly, we find that the modest detection rate of cold gas (H$_2$ or C I) in GRB spectra can be explained mainly by a low volume filling factor of cold gas clouds and to a lesser degree by destruction from the GRB explosion itself.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the structure and kinematics of the ionized core of M\,2-9 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present interferometric observations at 1 and 3\,mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of the free-free continuum and mm-wavelength recombination line (mRRL) emission of the ionized core (within $\lsim$130\,au) of the young Planetary Nebula (PN) candidate M\,2-9.These inner regions are concealed in the vast majority of similar objects. A spectral index for the mm-to-cm continuum of $\sim$0.9 indicates predominantly free-free emission from an ionized wind, with a minor contribution from warm dust. The mm-continuum emission in M\,2-9 reveals an elongated structure along the main symmetry axis of the large-scale bipolar nebula with a C-shaped curvature surrounded by a broad-waisted component. This structure is consistent with an ionized bent jet and a perpendicular compact dusty disk. The presence of a compact equatorial disk (of radius $\sim$50\,au) is also supported by red-shifted CO and \trecem\ absorption profiles observed from the base of the receding north lobe against the compact background continuum. The redshift observed in the CO absorption profiles likely signifies gas infall movements from the disk toward a central source. The mRRLs exhibit velocity gradients along the axis, implying systematic expansion in the C-shaped bipolar outflow. The highest expansion velocities ($\sim$80\,\kms) are found in two diagonally opposed compact regions along the axis, referred to as the high-velocity spots/shells (HVS), indicating either rapid wind acceleration or shocks at radial distances of $\sim$0\farc02-0\farc04 ($\sim$15-25\,au) from the center. A subtle velocity gradient perpendicular to the lobes is also found, suggestive of rotation. Our ALMA observations detect increased brightness and broadness in the mRRLs... (abridged).</description>

      <title>Hidden Cooling Flows in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative cooling time of hot gas in the cool cores of many galaxy clusters and massive elliptical galaxies drops in the centre to below 100 million years. The mass cooling rates inferred from simple modelling of X-ray observations of these objects are very low, indicating that either AGN feedback is tightly balanced or that soft X-rays from cooling gas are somehow hidden from view. An intrinsic absorption model developed for application to galaxy clusters is used here to search for hidden cooling flows (HCFs) in seven nearby elliptical galaxies. Mass cooling rates of 0.5-8 solar masses per year are found in each galaxy. The absorbed cooling flow luminosity is in agreement with the observed Far Infrared (FIR) luminosity in each case, indicating absorbed emission is energetically capable of emerging in the FIR band. An observed lack of agreement between HCF rates and normal star formation rates suggests the cooled material must have an alternative fate, with low-mass star formation considered as the primary outcome.</description>

      <title>Components of star formation in NGC 253 : Non-negative Matrix Factorization Analysis with the ALCHEMI integrated intensity images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential to examine the physical or chemical properties of molecular gas in starburst galaxies to reveal the underlying mechanisms characterizing starbursts. We used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract individual molecular or physical components involved in the star formation process in NGC\,253. We used images of 148 transitions from 44 different species of the ALMA large program ALCHEMI. Additionally, we included the continuum images at ALMA Bands 3 and 7 from the same dataset. For the five NMF components (NF1--5), we obtained that their distributions correspond to various basic phenomena related to star formation: i) low-density gas extended through the galactic central molecular zone (NF2), ii) shocks (NF3), iii) starburst regions (NF4), and iv) young star-forming regions (NF5). The other component (NF1) is related to excitation; three components obtained by NMF (NF3, 1, and 5) show a strong dependence upon the upper state energies of transitions, and represent low-, intermediate-, and high-excitation, respectively. We also compared our results using principal component analysis (PCA) previously applied to the same dataset. Molecular components extracted from NMF are similar to the ones obtained from PCA. However, NMF is better at extracting components associated with a single physical component, while a single component in PCA usually contains information on multiple physical components. This is especially true for features with weak intensities like emission from outflows. Our results suggest that NMF can be one of promising methods interpreting molecular line survey data, especially in the upcoming era of wide-band receivers.</description>

      <title>A GMRT 610 MHz radio survey of the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP, ADF-N) / Euclid Deep Field North</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a 610 MHz radio survey covering 1.94 square degrees around the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP), which includes parts of the AKARI (ADF-N) and Euclid, Deep Fields North. The median 5-sigma sensitivity is 28 microJy beam per beam, reaching as low as 19 microJy per beam, with a synthesised beam of 3.6 x 4.1 arcsec. The catalogue contains 1675 radio components, with 339 grouped into multi-component sources and 284 isolated components likely part of double radio sources. Imaging, cataloguing, and source identification are presented, along with preliminary scientific results. From a non-statistical sub-set of 169 objects with multi-wavelength AKARI and other detections, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) represent 66 percent of the sample, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) 4 percent, and sources with L_IR &lt; 1011 L_sun 30 percent. In total, 56 percent of sources show some AGN presence, though only seven are AGN-dominated. ULIRGs require three times higher AGN contribution to produce high-quality SED fits compared to lower luminosity galaxies, and AGN presence increases with AGN fraction. The PAH mass fraction is insignificant, although ULIRGs have about half the PAH strength of lower IR-luminosity galaxies. Higher luminosity galaxies show gas and stellar masses an order of magnitude larger, suggesting higher star formation rates. For LIRGs, AGN presence increases with redshift, indicating that part of the total luminosity could be contributed by AGN activity rather than star formation. Simple cross-matching revealed 13 ROSAT QSOs, 45 X-ray sources, and 61 sub-mm galaxies coincident with GMRT radio sources.</description>

      <title>Probing the heating of the neutral atomic interstellar medium in the Dwarf Galaxy Survey through infrared cooling lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is regulated by dynamical and thermal processes. The photoelectric effect on small dust grains usually dominates the heating of the star-forming neutral atomic gas reservoir in metal-rich galaxies, while the lower dust-to-gas mass ratio and the higher luminosity of X-ray sources in metal-poor galaxies suggest that other heating mechanisms may be at play. We calculate the relative contributions of the photoelectric effect, photoionization by UV and X-ray photons, and ionization by cosmic rays to the total heating in a sample of 37 nearby galaxies reaching down to 3% the Milky Way metallicity. We use the statistical code MULTIGRIS together with a grid of Cloudy models propagating radiation from stellar clusters and X-ray sources to the ionized and neutral gas, each galaxy being described as a statistical distribution of many 1D components. Infrared cooling lines from the interstellar medium (ISM) are used as constraints to evaluate the most likely distributions and parameters. We show that the photoelectric effect heating dominates in high-metallicity galaxies (&gt;1/18 the Milky Way value) while cosmic rays and especially photoionization from X-rays become predominant in low-metallicity galaxies. Our models predict reasonably well the X-ray source fluxes in the 0.3-8 keV band using indirect ISM tracers, illustrating that the adopted strategy makes it possible to recover the global intrinsic radiation field properties when X-ray observations are unavailable, for instance in early universe galaxies. Finally, we show that the photoelectric effect heating efficiency on PAHs may be recovered through the [CII]+[OI] / PAH observational proxy only if the other heating mechanisms are accounted for (abridged).</description>

      <title>A New Model for the Extragalactic Radio Sky at Low Frequency Calibrated Using the LOFAR Two-metre Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building the radio sky template are crucial for detecting the 21 cm emission line signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), as well as for other cosmological research endeavors. Utilizing data from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 150 MHz, we recalibrated the luminosity function for various types of radio sources, including High Excitation Radio Galaxies (HERGs), Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs), Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (RQ-AGNs), and Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGs). We subsequently updated the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) code to generate refined mock radio source catalogues. The simulated source counts from this work align more closely with observed data at redshifts greater than $z&gt;4$. Additionally, the differential source counts in total intensity within the flux density range of $0.1-1~\mathrm{mJy}$ closely mirror actual observations. Due to our model incorporating a lower number of faint sources compared to T-RECS, it predicts a reduced power spectrum for point sources, suggesting a potential advantage in studies in low frequency band.</description>

      <title>Rotation curves of disk galaxies and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the flat rotation curves observed at large radii in disk galaxies can be interpreted as an effect of General Relativity (GR) instead of the presence of dark matter (DM) halos in Newtonian gravity. In Ciotti (2022) the problem is rigorously explored in the special setting of the weak-field, low-velocity gravitomagnetic limit of GR. The rotation curves are obtained for purely baryonic disk models with realistic density profiles, and compared with the predictions of Newtonian gravity for the same disks, in absence of DM. The rotation curves are indistinguishable, with percentual GR corrections at all radii of the order of $\approx 10^{-6}$ or less, so that DM halos are required in gravitomagnetism as in Newtonian gravity. From a more general point of view, a list of the most urgent problems that must be addressed by any proposed GR-based alternative to the existence of DM, is given.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Diagnostics for Narrow Line Regions of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure can affect the observed ratios of specific strong emission lines within galaxies. While the theoretical strong lines diagnostics for gas metallicity, ionization parameters, and gas pressure in star-forming regions are well-established, theoretical diagnostics for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) narrow line regions are still lacking. In Zhu et al. (2023), we presented a new AGN model that provides the best predictions for observations spanning the UV, optical, and infrared wavelengths. This paper presents a suite of theoretical diagnostics for the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, gas pressure, and the peak energy in AGN ionizing radiation field $E_{peak}$ for AGN narrow-line regions spanning the UV and optical wavelengths. We investigate the model dependency on the ionization parameter, gas pressure, $E_{peak}$, and the nitrogen scaling relation and make recommendations on metallicity diagnostics that are most robust against these parameters. We test our new AGN metallicity diagnostics using optical galaxy spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16. These tests show that the metallicities measured from different diagnostics in this paper are consistent within $\sim0.3$ dex. We compare consistent HII and AGN diagnostics and demonstrate that HII and AGN diagnostics should not be used interchangeably. With a wide wavelength coverage, we anticipate that these AGN diagnostics will enable new metallicity studies of galaxies dominated by AGN.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. II. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Fractional non-CDM Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $24$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog with initial conditions appropriate for scenarios where non-cold DM is a fraction of the total DM abundance (f-NCDM models), as the second installment of the COZMIC suite. We initialize our simulations using transfer functions, $T_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)\equiv\sqrt{P_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)/P_{\mathrm{CDM}}(k)}$ (where $P(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum), with an initial suppression similar to thermal-relic warm DM (WDM) followed by a constant-amplitude plateau. We simulate suppression wave numbers $[22.8,~ 32.1,~ 41.8,~ 52.0,~ 57.1,~ 95.3]~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to thermal-relic WDM masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,~ 4,~ 5,~ 6,~ 6.5,~ 10]~\mathrm{keV}$, and plateau amplitudes $\delta\in [0.2,~ 0.4,~ 0.6,~ 0.8]$. We model the subhalo mass function in terms of the suppression wave number and $\delta$. Integrating these models into a forward model of the MW satellite galaxy population yields new limits on f-NCDM scenarios, with suppression wave numbers greater than $46$ and $ 40~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $\delta=0.2$, $0.4$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain $\delta&gt;0.4$. We map these limits to scenarios where a fraction $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ of DM behaves as a thermal relic, which yields the following bounds on cosmologies with a mixture of WDM and CDM: $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;3.6,~ 4.1,~ 4.6,~ 4.9,~ 5.4~\mathrm{keV}$ for $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}=0.5,~ 0.6,~ 0.7,~ 0.8,~ 0.9$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain WDM fractions $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}&lt;0.5$. Our results affirm that low-mass halo abundances are sensitive to partial suppression in $P(k)$, indicating the possibility of using galactic substructure to reconstruct $P(k)$ on small scales.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as supermassive black holes seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^{6-10}~M_{\odot}$) in the first cosmic Gyr ($z\gtrsim 6$) challenges current models of BH formation and evolution. We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume a non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models; these scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially formed in the high-$\sigma$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out of which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH accretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction. PBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense core, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading to the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\sim 20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\sim 10^7\ M_\odot$ corresponding to $\sim 5-7\sigma$ fluctuations), and provides massive ($\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\odot}$) seeds by $z\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that provides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\rm seed}(z)=3.1\times 10^{5}\ { M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\times 10^{9}\ {M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding mechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs, namely $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\sim 6-7$ quasars can be explained with $6\times 10^4 M_{\rm \odot}$ seeds planted at $z\sim 32$, and growing at sub-Eddington rates, $\langle\lambda_{\rm E}\rangle\sim 0.55$. The same scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at $z=10.6$, while UHZ1 ($z=10.1$) and GHZ9 ($z=10$) data favour instead slightly later ($z\sim 20-25$), more massive ($10^5~M_{\rm \odot}$) seeds.

Abstract: Relativistic jets manifest some of the most intriguing activities in the nuclear regions of active galaxies. Identifying the most powerful relativistic jets permits us to probe the most luminous accretion systems and, in turn, the most massive black holes. This paper reports the identification of one such object, PMN J1310$-$5552 ($z=1.56$), a blazar candidate of uncertain type detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope. The detection of broad emission lines in its optical spectra taken with the X-Shooter and Goodman spectrographs classifies it to be a flat-spectrum radio quasar. The analysis of the Goodman optical spectrum has revealed PMN J1310$-$5552 harbors a massive black hole (log scale $M_{\rm BH}=9.90\pm0.07$, in $M_{\odot}$) and luminous accretion disk (log scale $L_{\rm disk}=46.86\pm0.03$, in erg s$^{-1}$). The fitting of the observed big blue bump with the standard accretion disk model resulted in the log scale $M_{\rm BH}=9.81^{+0.19}_{-0.20}$ (in $M_{\odot}$) and $L_{\rm disk}=46.86^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$ (in erg s$^{-1}$), respectively. These parameters suggest PMN J1310$-$5552 hosts one of the most massive black holes and the most luminous accretion disks among the blazar population. The physical properties of this enigmatic blazar were studied by modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution considering the data from NuSTAR, Swift, Fermi-LAT, and archival observations. Overall, PMN J1310$-$5552 is a powerful `MeV' blazar with physical parameters similar to other members of this unique class of blazars. These results provide glimpses of monsters lurking among the unknown high-energy emitters and demonstrate the importance of ongoing wide-field sky surveys to discover them.</description>

      <title>ALMA Spectral Survey of An eruptive Young star, V883 Ori (ASSAY): II. Freshly Sublimated Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the Keplerian Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with ALMA in Band 6 (220.7$-$274.9 GHz). We identified about 3,700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of COMs detected through the iterative LTE line fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH$_{3}$CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH$_2$OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH$_2$OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COMs abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.</description>

      <title>FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: simulation on hunting HI filament with pairwise stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filaments stand as pivotal structures within the cosmic web. However, direct detection of the cold gas content of the filaments remains challenging due to its inherent low brightness temperature. With the TNG hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of isolating faint filament HI signal from the FAST HI intensity mapping (IM) survey through pairwise stacking of galaxies, which yields an average HI filament signal amplitude of $\sim 0.28\ {\mu{\rm K}}$ at $z\simeq 0.1$. However, our simulations reveal a non-negligible contribution from HI-rich galaxies within or near the filaments. Particularly, the faint galaxies dominantly contribute to the extra filament HI signal. Our simulation also shows that the measurement uncertainty is produced by both thermal noise and background variation caused by brightness leakage from surrounding random galaxies. Given a fixed total observation time, a wide-field HI IM survey, which includes a large number of galaxy pairs, can simultaneously reduce thermal noise to below the filament signal level and minimize background variation to a negligible level. Through the end-to-end simulation, this work demonstrates the critical role of the galaxy pairwise stacking method in future filament HI detection, outlining a road map for filament HI detection in the next-generation HI IM surveys.</description>

      <title>Half a Million Binary Stars identified from the low resolution spectra of LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.

      <title>A luminous and young galaxy at z=12.33 revealed by a JWST/MIRI detection of H{\alpha} and [OIII]</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early universe (&lt;500 Myrs after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy formation models and whose physical properties remain to be fully understood. Insight into their internal physics is best captured through nebular lines but, at these early epochs, the brightest of these spectral features are redshifted into the mid-infrared and remain elusive. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument, MIRI, here we present the first detection of H{\alpha} and doubly-ionized oxygen ([OIII]5007AA) at z&gt;10. These detections place the bright galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 at z=12.33+/-0.04, making it the most distant astronomical object with direct spectroscopic detection of these lines. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primeval, luminous galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe likely driven by compact and young (~30Myr) burst of star formation. Its oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment. This study confirms the unique conditions of this remarkably bright and distant galaxy and the huge potential of mid-IR observations to characterize these objects.</description>

      <title>Star formation in the high-extinction Planck cold clump PGCC G120.69+2.66</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation occurring in the Planck Galactic cold clump PGCC 120.69+2.66. Near-infrared JHKs images and K-band spectroscopy obtained with NOTCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope complemented with archive data are used to study the stellar content. In addition, millimetre line CO and CS spectra were obtained with the Onsala 20 m telescope, and sub-millimetre continuum SCUBA archive data are used to characterise the host molecular cloud. We identify a molecular cloud core traced by CO and CS emission at a distance of 1.1 kpc. In the region studied, we identify 5 submm continuum cores. Embedded in and around these dense submm cores, we find 38 young stellar objects, classified as 9 Class I, 8 Class II, and 21 near-IR excess or variability sources, accompanied by bipolar nebulosities and signs of protostellar jets. Furthermore, a very bright and reddened source is found towards this molecular cloud core. Even though its location appears to suggest its association to the star formation region, its infrared spectral type is compatible with a red supergiant, hidden behind 36 mag of visual extinction.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Formation of $\rm{H_2}$, Dust, and Stars in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Molecular hydrogen ($\rm{H_2}$) is crucial in galaxy formation and evolution, serving as the main fuel for star formation (SF). In metal-enriched environments, $\rm{H_2}$ primarily forms on interstellar dust grain surfaces. However, due to the complexities of modelling this process, SF in cosmological simulations often relies on empirical or theoretical frameworks validated only in the Local Universe to estimate the abundance of $\rm{H_2}$.
  Aims: This study aims to model the connection between star, dust, and $\rm{H_2}$ formation processes in cosmological simulations.
  Methods: We include $\rm{H_2}$ formation on dust grain surfaces and account for molecule destruction and radiation shielding into the SF and feedback model MUPPI.
  Results: The model reproduces key properties of observed galaxies for stellar, dust, and $\rm{H_2}$ components. The cosmic density of $\rm{H_2}$ ($\rho_{\rm{H2}}$) peaks around $z=1.5$, then decreases by half towards $z=0$, showing milder evolution than observed. The $\rm{H_2}$ mass function since $z=2$ also shows gentler evolution. Our model successfully recovers the integrated molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt (mKS) law between surface star formation rate ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and surface $\rm{H_2}$ density ($\Sigma_{\rm H2}$) at $z=0$, already evident at $z=2$ with a higher normalization. We find hints of a broken power law with a steeper slope at higher $\Sigma_{\rm H2}$, aligning with some observational findings. Additionally, the $\rm{H_2}$-to-dust mass ratio in galaxies shows a decreasing trend with gas metallicity and stellar mass. The $\rm{H_2}$-to-dust mass fraction for the global galaxy population is higher at higher redshifts. The analysis of the atomic-to-molecular transition on a particle-by-particle basis suggests that gas metallicity cannot reliably substitute the dust-to-gas ratio in models simulating dust-promoted $\rm{H_2}$.</description>

      <title>Slope of Magnetic Field-Density Relation as An Indicator of Magnetic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star-formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic field is best summarized by the Cruther+ 2010 B-rho relation. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in the collapse, or the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, ${\cal M}_{\rm A}$-k$_{B-\rho}$(slope of $B-\rho$ relation) relation. This fundamental B-$\rho$-slope relation enables one to measure the Alfv\'enic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B-$\rho$ plane. It allows us to drive the following empirical $B-\rho$ relation \begin{equation}
  \frac{B}{B_c} = {\rm exp}\left(\left(\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{{\cal K}}\right)\nonumber, \end{equation} which offers an excellent fit to the Cruther et al. data, where we assume ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-\rho$ relation. The foundational ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-{\rm k}_{B-\rho}$ relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of Cruther+2010, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.</description>

      <title>cogsworth: A Gala of COSMIC proportions combining binary stellar evolution and galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cogsworth, an open-source Python tool for producing self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations. With cogsworth one can (1) sample a population of binaries and star formation history, (2) perform rapid (binary) stellar evolution, (3) integrate orbits through the galaxy and (4) inspect the full evolutionary history of each star or compact object, as well as their positions and kinematics. We include the functionality for post-processing hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations as a basis for galactic potentials and star formation histories to better account for initial spatial stellar clustering and more complex potentials. Alternatively, several analytic models are available for both the potential and star formation history. cogsworth can transform the intrinsic simulated population to an observed population through the joint application of dust maps, bolometric correction functions and survey selection functions.
  We provide a detailed explanation of the functionality of cogsworth and demonstrate its capabilities through a series of use cases: (1) We predict the spatial distribution of compact objects and runaways in both dwarf and Milky-Way-like galaxies, (2) using a star cluster from a hydrodynamical simulation, we show how supernovae can change the orbits of stars in several ways, and (3) we predict the separation of disrupted binary stellar companions on the sky and create a synthetic Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. We also discuss some current limitations and plans for future developments. We designed cogsworth and its online documentation to provide a powerful tool for constraining binary evolution, but also a flexible and accessible resource for the entire community.</description>

      <title>Helical randomization of magnetized Galactic and galaxy clusters plasmas: from magnetorotational disc dynamo to the Faraday rotation sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using results of numerical simulations and Galactic and galaxy clusters observations, it is shown that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the Galactic and galaxy clusters magnetized plasmas occurs via a randomization process. The notion of distributed chaos has been used to describe the randomization process. The randomization can be quantified with the main parameter of the distributed chaos, which in turn can be related to magnetic helicity or its dissipation rate. Spontaneous breaking of local reflectional symmetry (an intrinsic property of chaotic/turbulent motions) generates local helicity even when the global helicity is negligible. It is shown that the magnetic fields can impose their level of randomization on the electron density, Faraday rotation maps, and polarized synchrotron emission. Results of the numerical simulations of the Galactic and galaxy clusters dynamos: the inner disk's ones (based on the magnetorotational instability) and global ones, are in good agreement with this approach, as well as with the results obtained using observations of the Faraday rotation sky and polarized synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse Accretion Disks Within Dark Matter Halos: Saturation of the Magnetorotational Instability and the Field Expulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have used high-resolution zoom-in simulations of direct collapse to supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds within dark mater (DM) halos in the presence of magnetic fields generated during the collapse, down to $10^{-5}$ pc or 2 AU. We confirm an efficient amplification of magnetic field during collapse, the formation of a geometrically thick self-gravitating accretion disk inside 0.1 pc, and damping of fragmentation in the disk by the field. This disk differs profoundly from SMBH accretion disks. We find the following: (1) The accretion disk is subject to the magnetorotational instability which further amplifies the field to near equipartition. No artificial seeding of the disk field has been used. (2) The equipartition toroidal field changes its polarity in the midplane. (3) The nonlinear Parker instability develops, accompanied by the vertical buckling of the field lines, which injects material above the disk, leading to an increase in the disk scale height; (4) With the Coriolis force producing a coherent helicity above the disk, vertical poloidal field has been generated and amplified. (5) We estimate that the associated outflow will be most probably squashed by accretion. The resulting configuration consists of a magnetized disk with $\beta &gt; 0.1$ and its magnetosphere with $\beta &lt;&lt; 1$, where $\beta = P_{\rm th}/P_{\rm B}$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy density. (6) The disk is highly variable, due to feeding by variable accretion flow, and strong vortical motions are present. (7) Finally, the negative gradient of the total vertical stress drives an equatorial outflow sandwiched by an inward accretion flow.</description>

      <title>The JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS): Extending rest-optical narrow-band emission line selection into the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS), a Cycle 1 JWST imaging programme exploiting the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of NIRCam to extend narrow-band rest-optical emission line selection into the epoch of reionization (EoR) for the first time, and to enable unique studies of the resolved ionised gas morphology in individual galaxies across cosmic history. The primary JELS observations comprise $\sim4.7\mu$m narrow-band imaging over $\sim63$ arcmin$^{2}$ designed to enable selection of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z\sim6.1$, as well as the selection of a host of novel emission-line samples including [OIII] at $z\sim8.3$ and Pa $\alpha/\beta$ at $z\sim1.5/2.8$. For the prime F466N and F470N narrow-band observations, the emission-line sensitivities achieved are up to $\sim2\times$ more sensitive than current slitless spectroscopy surveys (5$\sigma$ limits of 1.1-1.6$\times10^{-18}\text{erg s}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$), corresponding to unobscured H$\alpha$ star-formation rates (SFRs) of 1-1.6 $\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ at $z\sim6.1$ and extending emission-line selections in the EoR to fainter populations. Simultaneously, JELS also obtained F200W broadband and F212N narrow-band imaging (H$\alpha$ at $z\sim2.23$) that probes SFRs $\gtrsim5\times$ fainter than previous ground-based narrow-band studies ($\sim0.2 \text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$), offering an unprecedented resolved view of star formation at cosmic noon. In this paper we describe the detailed JELS survey design, key data processing steps specific to the survey observations, and demonstrate the exceptional data quality and imaging sensitivity achieved. We then summarise the key scientific goals of JELS and present some early science results, including examples of spectroscopically confirmed H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters discovered by JELS that illustrate the novel parameter space probed.</description>

      <title>Supernova Shocks in Molecular Clouds: Shocks Driven into Dense Cores in IC 443 and 3C 391</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova shocks into dense molecular cores in IC 443 (clumps B, C, and G) and 3C 391 were observed using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and complemented by archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory. The pure rotational transitions 0-0 S(1) and S(5) of H2, and the ground-state 110-101 transition of H2O, are all broadened, arising from molecules that survive the passage of the shock front. Theoretical models from the Paris-Durham shock code were analyzed to generate synthetic profiles that approximately match the observations. The observations can be fit with two shock conditions, which approximate the range of densities in the pre-shock molecular cloud. The width and brightness of the S(5) lines require shocks into gas with a density of order 2,000 cm-3, into which the IC 443 blast wave drives shocks with speed 60 km/s. The brightness and narrower width of the S(1) lines requires different shocks, into gas with density of order 10^5 cm-3, with shock speeds of 10 km/s. The H2O velocity distribution is also consistent with these shocks. The existence of shocks into dense gas shows that the bright shocked clumps in IC~443 were prestellar cores. It is unlikely that they will form stars soon after the passage of the shock front, given the input of kinetic and thermal energy from the shocks.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band follow-up I. Carbon-chain chemistry of intermediate-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} &lt; m_* &lt;8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic variables from Sloan Digital Sky Survey -- V (2020-2023) identified using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SDSS-V is carrying out a dedicated survey for white dwarfs, single and in binaries, and we report the analysis of the spectroscopy of 504 cataclysmic variables (CVs) and CV candidates obtained during the first 34 months of observations of SDSS-V. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to aid with the identification of CV candidates among the over 2 million SDSS-V spectra obtained with the BOSS spectrograph. The CNN reduced the number of spectra that required visual inspection to $\simeq2$ per cent of the total. We identified 776 CV spectra among the CNN-selected candidates, plus an additional 27 CV spectra that the CNN misclassified, but that were found serendipitously by human inspection of the data. Analysing the SDSS-V spectroscopy and ancillary data of the 504 CVs in our sample, we report 61 new CVs, spectroscopically confirm 248 and refute 13 published CV candidates, and we report 82 new or improved orbital periods. We discuss the completeness and possible selection biases of the machine learning methodology, as well as the effectiveness of targeting CV candidates within SDSS-V. Finally, we re-assess the space density of CVs, and find $1.2\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing Monte Carlo electromagnetic transport models, finding good agreement within EBL uncertainties.</description>
