      <title>Green pathway of Urea Synthesis through Plasma-Ice Interaction Optimization and Mechanistic Insights with N2 + CO2 and NH3 + CO2 Gas Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a green pathway for urea synthesis using plasma-ice interaction with gas mixtures of N2 + CO2 and NH3 + CO2. Electrical and optical emission spectroscopy were employed to characterize the plasmas, revealing that urea formation involves complex reactions driven by high-energy species, producing reactive nitrogen and carbon intermediates that further react to form urea. Physicochemical analyses of plasma-treated ice showed increased pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Optimization of plasma process parameters (gas pressure, applied voltage, and treatment time) was performed to enhance urea formation. Among these parameters, plasma treatment time had the most substantial influence. Increasing treatment time from 20 to 60 minutes significantly impacted physicochemical properties: for N2 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 21.05%, EC by 184.7%, and ORP decreased by 27.48%; for NH3 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 27.37%, EC by 239.05%, and ORP decreased by 72.67%, respectively. The study shows that NH3 + CO2 plasma produces a significantly higher concentration of urea (7.7 mg L-1) compared to N2 + CO2 plasma (0.55 mg L-1). This is attributed to the direct availability and reactivity of ammonia, which simplifies reaction pathways and enhances intermediate formation. These findings highlight the potential of plasma-ice interaction as an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method for urea synthesis, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional processes.</description>

      <title>Comment on "ENN's roadmap for proton-boron fusion based on spherical torus" [Phys. Plasmas 31, 062507 (2024)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comment discusses the feasibility of hot ion mode ${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}=4$ for proton-boron fusion which is critical for the roadmap proposed in Liu, M et al [Phys. Plasmas 31, 062507 (2024)]. The hot ion mode ${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}=4$ has been calculated to be far from accessible (${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}&lt;1.5$ for ${{T}_{i}}=150\text{keV}$) under the most optimal conditions if fusion provides the heating (Xie, H [Introduction to Fusion Ignition Principles: Zeroth Order Factors of Fusion Energy Research (in Chinese), USTC Press, Hefei, 2023]), i.e., that all fusion power serves to heat the ions and that electrons acquire energy only through interactions with ions. We also discuss if hot ion mode of ${{T}_{i}}/{{T}_{e}}=4$ could be achieved by an ideal heating method which is much more efficient than fusion itself and only heats the ions, whether it makes sense economically.</description>

      <title>The effect of separatrix density and PFC material on H-mode confinement in the ITPA global H-mode database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data, added to the ITPA global H-mode database [1] for ASDEX-U [2] and JET-ILW, reveals that the separatrix density $n_{sep}$ has a correlation with the H20 factor (Confinement time relative to the ITPA20-IL scaling)[1]. These trends are analyzed in detail. They are not a result of proximity to the density limit. The normalized $n_{sepN} = n_{sep} / \bar{n}$ is introduced, motivated by theory ($\bar{n}$ is the average density). The trends in $n_{sepN}$ can be understood in terms of the two main mechanisms of pedestal characteristics -- MHD stability and recently developed theories of gyrokinetic transport. Careful analysis shows these mechanisms can be distinguished in the data. The most dramatic improvement in confinement time arises primarily from reductions in pedestal transport. A new definition of density peaking that includes core peaking is found to best explain H20 when advanced H-modes are included: $n_{sepN0} = n_{sep}/n(0)$, the inverse of the total density peaking from the separatrix to the axis. The highest H-factors are reached by the confluence of relatively low normalized $n_{sepN0}$ plus high Shafranov shift or poloidal beta. The importance of these two variables is also theoretically predicted from recent analysis of the gyrokinetic system, where a constraint can limit the access of ITG/TEM modes to free energy in equilibrium gradients. The Plasma Facing Component (PFC) material also shows a strong influence in the data. This is likely due to the importance of $n(0)/n_{sep}$ to attaining high H20, in conjunction with the known tendency for tungsten (W) to accumulate with density peaking and low transport. Preliminary results indicate that $n_{sepN0}$ might also be important with core ITBs.</description>

      <title>Flux-Rope Mediated Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence, applicable when the magnetic helicity is non-zero. The new model differs from the Lazarian-Vishniac turbulent reconnection theory by emphasizing the role of locally coherent magnetic structures, whose existence is shown to be permitted by the properties of magnetic field line separation in turbulent plasma. Local coherence allows storage of magnetic helicity inside the reconnection layer and we argue that helicity conservation produces locally coherent twisted flux ropes. We then introduce the "Alfv\'en horizon" to explain why the global reconnection rate can be governed by locally coherent magnetic field structure instead of by field line wandering, formally extending to 3D the principle that reconnection can be made fast by fragmentation of the global current layer. Coherence is shown to dominate over field line dispersion if the anisotropy of the turbulence at the perpendicular scale matching the thickness of a marginally stable current layer exceeds the aspect ratio of the current layer. Finally, we conjecture that turbulence generated within the reconnection layer may produce a balance of anisotropies that maintains the system in the flux-rope mediated regime. The new model successfully accounts for the major features of 3D numerical simulations of self-generated turbulent reconnection, including reconnection rates of 0.01 in resistive MHD and 0.1 with collisionless physics.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Motion of Ions in a Resonantly Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe for the first time an effect on the driver caused by the motion of ions in a plasma wakefield accelerator. The effect manifests itself as a beam tail, which only occurs when sufficient motion of ions suppresses wakefields. By changing the plasma ions (helium, argon, xenon) in the experiment, we show that the effect depends inversely on the ion mass, as predicted from theory and simulations. Wakefields are driven resonantly by multiple bunches, and simulation results indicate that the ponderomotive force causes the motion of ions. In this case, the effect is also expected to depend on the amplitude of the wakefields, as also observed by varying the bunch charge.</description>

      <title>Detachment scalings derived from 1D scrape-off-layer simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion power plants will require active detachment control to mitigate sputtering. Although detachment control has been demonstrated on current fusion experiments, achieving this on fusion power plants will be more challenging due to their reduced diagnostic set. Real-time scrape-off-layer (SOL) modeling will help to fill this "diagnostic gap". To determine the minimal set of physics required for accurate SOL modeling, we use the configurable Hermes-3 edge modeling framework to perform simple, fixed-fraction-impurity 1D Braginskii simulations. We show that these simulations reproduce distinctive attached and detached conditions, as well as the characteristic ion-flux rollover. We also perform scans of the input heat flux and impurity concentration, and show that the results predict similar trends to the lower-fidelity Lengyel model. This allows us to also indirectly compare to SOLPS simulations, and we find that the Lengyel model has similar "over-estimation" factors to Hermes-1D and SOLPS. This indirect comparison highlights a series of extensions to bring our Hermes-1D results closer to the higher-fidelity 2D modeling, with the goal of developing time-dependent detachment control suitable for next-generation fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Inferring the scrape-off layer heat flux width in a divertor with a low degree of axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma facing components (PFCs) in the next generation of tokamak devices will operate in challenging environments, with heat loads predicted to exceed 10 MWm$^{-2}$. The magnitude of these heat loads is set by the width of the channel, the "scrape-off layer" (SOL), into which heat is exhausted, and can be characterised by an e-folding length scale for the decay of heat flux across the channel. It is expected this channel will narrow as tokamaks move towards reactor relevant conditions. Understanding the processes involved in setting the SOL heat flux width is imperative to be able to predict the heat loads PFCs must handle in future devices. Measurements of the SOL width are performed on the high-field spherical tokamak, ST40, using a newly commissioned infrared thermography system. With its high on-axis toroidal magnetic field ($\geq$1.5 T) ST40 is uniquely positioned to investigate the influence of toroidal field on the heat flux width in spherical tokamaks, whilst also extending measurements of the SOL width in spherical tokamaks to increased poloidal field ($\geq$0.3 T). Due to the divertor on ST40 having a low degree of axisymmetry, it is necessary for a set of radial measurements of the heat flux to be taken across the divertor, made possible using an automated toolchain that fully incorporates its 3D geometry. These radial profiles are combined with the magnetic topology of the plasma to infer the width of the SOL, with both single and double exponential profiles of heat flux observed. A reduction in the heat flux is observed toroidally across part of the divertor, with preliminary investigations indicating that partial shadowing occurs, resulting from the separation between magnetic field lines and trailing edges upstream of the observed region becoming comparable to the ion gyro-radius.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic flux-driven simulations in mixed TEM/ITG regime using a delta-f PIC scheme with evolving background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of global gyrokinetic simulations of turbulence using a Particle-In-Cell framework, verifying the delta-f assumption with a fixed background distribution becomes challenging when determining quasi-steady state profiles corresponding to given sources over long time scales, where plasma profiles can evolve significantly. The advantage of low relative sampling noise afforded by the delta-f scheme is shown to be retained by considering the background as a time-evolving Maxwellian with time-dependent density and temperature profiles. Implementation of this adaptive scheme to simulate electrostatic collisionless flux-driven turbulence in tokamak plasmas show small and non-increasing sampling noise levels, which would otherwise increase indefinitely with a stationary background scheme. The adaptive scheme furthermore allows one to reach numerically converged results of quasi-steady state with much lower marker numbers.</description>

      <title>Modeling of axion and electromagnetic fields coupling in a particle-in-cell code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions have aroused widespread research interest because they can solve the strong CP problem and serve as a possible candidate for dark matter. Currently, people have explored a lot of axion detection experiments, including passively detecting the existing axions in the universe, and actively generating axions in the laboratory. Recently, axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions have been discussed as a novel method to detect axions. Petawatt (PW) lasers are considered as a powerful tool to study not only the vacuum polarization but also the axion coupling, due to their extreme fields. However, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is still missed in current studies, which limits the understanding of axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions. In this paper, we proposed the method to include the axion field and the coupling with electromagnetic (EM) fields in PIC codes. The axion wave equation and modified Maxwell's equations are numerically solved, while the EM field modulation from axions is considered as a first-order perturbation. Meanwhile, different axion field boundary conditions are considered to satisfy different simulation scenarios. The processes of conversions between axions and photons, and weak laser pulse propagation with axion effects are checked as benchmarks of the code. Such an extended PIC code may help researchers develop novel axion detection schemes based on laser-plasma interactions and provide a better understanding of axion-coupled astrophysical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular radiation patterns of proton, deuteron or alpha emission are evaluated using particle-in-cell simulation of laser induced nanoplasmonic fusion. The differential Hanbury-Brown and Twiss analysis is widely used in astrophysics and in relativistic heavy ion physics to determine the source size of emitted particles. Here, we show how this method could be adopted for inertial confinement fusion. This method aims to determine the parameters of emitted nuclei after the fusion target ignition. In addition to spatial volume, the method can detect specific space-time correlation patterns connected to the collective flow post-ignition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton deflectometry is increasingly used in magnetized high-energy-density plasmas to observe electromagnetic fields. We describe a reconstruction algorithm to recover the electromagnetic fields from proton fluence data in 1-D. The algorithm is verified against analytic solutions and applied to example data. Secondly, we study the role of source fluence uncertainty for 1-D reconstructions. We show that reconstruction boundary conditions can be used to constrain the source fluence profile, and use this to develop a reconstruction using a specified pair of boundary conditions on the magnetic field. From these considerations we experimentally demonstrate a hybrid mesh-fluence reconstruction technique where fields are reconstructed from fluence data in an interior region with boundary conditions supplied by direct mesh measurements at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Sheath constraints on turbulent magnetised plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solid target in contact with a plasma charges (negatively) to reflect the more mobile species (electrons) and thus keep the bulk plasma quasineutral. To shield the bulk plasma from the charged target, there is an oppositely (positively) charged sheath with a sharp electrostatic potential variation on the Debye length scale $\lambda_{\rm D}$. In magnetised plasmas where the magnetic field is inclined at an oblique angle $\alpha$ with the target, some of the sheath potential variation occurs also on the ion sound gyroradius length scale $\rho_{\rm S} \cos \alpha$, caused by finite ion gyro-orbit distortion and losses. We consider a collisionless and steady-state magnetised plasma sheath whose thickness $l_{\rm ms} \sim \max (\lambda_{\rm D}, \rho_{\rm S} \cos \alpha)$ is smaller than the characteristic length scale $L$ of spatial fluctuations in the bulk plasma, such that the limit $l_{\rm ms} / L \rightarrow 0$ is appropriate. Spatial structures are assumed to be magnetic field-aligned. In the case of small magnetic field angle $ \alpha \sim \delta \equiv \rho_{\rm S} / L \ll 1$, electric fields tangential to the target transport ions towards the target via ExB drifts at a rate comparable to the one from parallel streaming. A generalised form of the kinetic Bohm-Chodura criterion at the sheath entrance is derived by requiring that the sheath electric field have a monotonic spatial decay far from the target. The criterion depends on tangential gradients of potential and ion distribution function, with additional nontrivial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we define the plasma dispersion function for a suprathermal plasma described with a regularized kappa distribution. As is known from Maxwellian as well as (standard) kappa plasmas, the respective Fried-Conte and the modified plasma dispersion functions are valuable tools for various analytical studies. For the latter is has been proven very useful to know about the mathematical properties, as analytical continuation, series expansions as well as asymptotic expressions. Given the growing popularity of the regularized kappa distribution, as indicated by its increasing number of applications to various problems related to suprathermal plasmas, we extend its theoretical treatment here by providing the corresponding plasma dispersion function along with various of its properties.</description>

      <title>Impact of repetitive ELM transients on ITER divertor tungsten monoblock top surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to the high stored energy of ITER plasmas, the heat pulses due to uncontrolled Type I edge localized modes (ELMs) can be sufficient to melt the top surface of several poloidal rows of tungsten monoblocks in the divertor strike point regions. Coupled with the melt motion associated with tungsten in the strong tokamak magnetic fields, the resulting surface damage after even a comparatively small number of such repetitive transients may have a significant impact on long-term stationary power handling capability. The permissible numbers set important boundaries on operation and on the performance required from the plasma control system. Modelling is carried out with the recently updated MEMENTO melt dynamics code, which is tailored to tackle melt motion problems characterized by a vast spatio-temporal scale separation. The crucial role of coupling between surface deformation and shallow angle heat loading in aggravating melt damage is highlighted. As a consequence, the allowable operational space in terms of ELM-induced transient heat loads is history-dependent and once deformation has occurred, weaker heat loads, incapable of melting a pristine surface, can further extend the damage.</description>
