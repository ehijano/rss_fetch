      <title>Nontrivial saddle points for spectral form factors of flat band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the spectral form factor of a flat band superconductor in two different ways. In the first approach, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian of this system exactly and numerically sum over the exact eigenstates to find the spectral form factor. In the second approach, we use mean field theory to evaluate the same spectral form factor. We demonstrate that both methods produce the same answer. Mean field theory for spectral form factors possesses features not previously seen in the theory of superconductivity, in particular complex gap functions and non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians. We explicitly show that these features are indeed necessary to obtain the correct spectral form factor.</description>

      <title>Electron density and compressibility in the Kitaev model with a spatially modulated Phase in the superconducting pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A current flowing through a one-dimensional Kitaev chain induces a spatial modulation in its superconducting pairing, characterized by a wave vector $Q$, which is known to induce two types of topological phase transitions: one is the customary band topology transition between gapped phases, while the other is a Lifshitz transition related to the Fermi surface topology and leading to a gapless superconducting phase. We investigate the behavior of the electron density $\rho$ and the compressibility $\kappa$ across the two types of transitions, as a function of the model parameters. We find that the behavior of $\rho$ as a function of $Q$ and chemical potential $\mu$ enables one to infer the ground state phase diagram. Moreover, the analysis of the compressibility $\kappa$ as a function of $\mu$ enables one to distinguish the two transitions: While $\kappa$ exhibits a symmetric divergence across the band topology transition, it displays an asymmetric jump across the Lifshitz transition.</description>

      <title>Ab initio screening for BCS-type superconductivity in ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we applied ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations to compounds with the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure to search for BCS superconductor candidates. From the 1883 compounds registered in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, we excluded those whose chemical compositions would inhibit the emergence of BCS-type superconductivity by giving rise to magnetism or heavy-fermionic behavior. We then focused on 66 compounds confirmed to be dynamically stable through phonon calculations. Among these, for the 24 systems with experimentally reported $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, we verified that the ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations exhibit excellent predictive reliability. For the remaining 42 compounds lacking experimental $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, our predictions identified several new BCS-type superconductor candidates, including SrPb$_2$Al$_2$ $\left(T_c^\mathrm{calc}=2.2\,\mathrm{K}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Pressure Induced Anomalous Metal in the Vicinity of the Superconductor Insulator Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Superconductor-to-Insulator Transition (SIT) in two-dimensional superconductors occurs due to a competition between superconductivity, quantum interferences, Coulomb interactions and disorder. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental investigation, the SIT remains an active research area due to the potential for exotic phases near the transition. One such phase is the Anomalous Metal, which has been claimed to exist between the insulating and superconducting states. This elusive phase, which is not consistent with current theories, is under heavy deliberations nowadays. We present an experimental study of the effect of high pressure on thin films of amorphous indium oxide. Our results show that pressure induces a series of transitions from a Bose insulator through a superconducting phase, metallic phases and finally to a conventional insulator. We suggest that our findings reaffirm the existence of a two-dimensional metal close to the SIT and show that its occurrence requires relatively strong coupling between regions that are weakly superconducting.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>Transport through Nodal Surface Semimetal - Superconductor junction in presence or absence of light irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum tunelling via $s$-wave superconductor (SC) junction with a topologically charged nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) where a nonsymmorphic symmetry forces the nodal surfaces to stick to the BZ boundary. Due to their unique dispersions close to the two dimensional band crossing, the charge carriers in the NSSM display interesting behavior in the nature of Andreev as well as normal reflections at the SC junction interface, for both subgap and supergap energies. We investigate such behaviors for different incident orientations. Furthermore, we also consider irradiation via light with circular and linear polarization on such systems and probe the stroboscopic temporal evolution of the transport parameters. In particular, we follow a Floquet approach in the limit of high frequency irradiation and witness there many unusal Andreev transport behavior to unfold.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Nonreciprocity in Asymmetric Josephson Junctions with Non-Sinusoidal Current-Phase Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) with non-sinusoidal current-phase relations (CPRs) have gathered increasing attention, partly due to growing interest in topological 2D materials. Understanding how CPR and inhomogeneities in JJs influence their response is crucial for accurate interpretation of experimental observations. This Letter reports that a non-sinusoidal CPR, combined with asymmetries in the JJ, can break spatial symmetry and give rise to the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the short junction regime. This nonreciprocity is shown to emerge as an intrinsic mechanism related to the maximization of the supercurrent, rather than being solely driven by geometric or material asymmetries. Further analysis shows that JDE efficiency is strongly influenced by the CPR shape but is largely insensitive to junction asymmetry, making the observed nonreciprocity not only a potential experimental signature of unconventional CPRs but also a possible method for probing their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resonant clock-power distribution network is critical for scaling energy efficient superconducting digital technology to practical high integration density circuits. High-k, tunable capacitors enable implementation of a resonant power delivery network supporting circuits with up to 400 Mdevices/cm2. We report the cryogenic characterization of Metal-Insulator-Metal capacitors using a Hafnium Zirconium Oxide (HZO) ferroelectric insulating layer and Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN) superconducting electrodes. The fabricated chip includes capacitor arrays for low frequency characterization and a half-wave transmission line resonator for RF characterization. A specific capacitance of 3 uF/cm2, DC leakage current of 10-8 A/cm2 at 2 V and a constant 5 percent tunability up to 4 GHz were measured at 2.6 K.</description>

      <title>Energy Gap Modulation in Proximitized Superconducting Puddles of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated proximity-induced superconductivity in a graphene-insulating InO bilayer system through gate-controlled transport measurements. Distinct oscillations in the differential conductance are observed across both the electron and hole doping regimes, with oscillation amplitudes increasing as the chemical potential moves away from the Dirac point. These findings are explained using a theoretical model of a normal-superconductor-normal (NSN) junction, which addresses reflection and transmission probabilities at normal incidence. From this model, we extract key parameters for the proximitized graphene, including the superconducting energy gap Delta and the effective length scale Ls of the superconducting regions. Near the Dirac point, we observe a minimal Ls and a maximal Delta, aligning with the theory that the gap in strongly disordered superconductors increases as the coherence length of localized pairs decreases. This suggests that spatial confinement in a low-density superconductor leads to an effective increase in the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</description>

      <title>Landauer-Limited Dissipation in Quantum-Flux-Parametron Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landauer limit is to irreversible logic what the Carnot cycle is to heat engines. This limit is approached in the adiabatic Quantum Flux Parametron (aQFP) by copying the inputs of standard logic gates to produce reversible logic gates, and disposing of the copied inputs using the "terminate" gate dissipating only the thermal energy, ln2$kT$. This method eliminates the non-adiabatic switching associated with backaction that arises in conventional aQFP logic. Real aQFP devices have parameter mismatch causing proportionate increases in dissipation and bit-error rate. A chip with $10^9$ aQFPs with realistic fabrication spread of 1%-1$\sigma$ control on junction critical current and 5%-1$\sigma$ on inductors would have outlier devices with a bit-error rate of $10^{-31}$, compared to $10^{-71}$ for ideal devices. Power dissipation across all devices on-chip would increase to about 7$\times$ the Landauer limit. An ideal circuit processing correlated bit streams dissipates fractional bit energy per cycle commensurate with the information lost, in accord with Landauer's concept of logical entropy.</description>

      <title>Spin bond order driven by extended repulsive interactions in doped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG) to study the many-body instabilities of correlated electrons in graphene doped near the van Hove singularity (VHS). The system is described by an extended Hubbard model including several Coulomb repulsions between neighboring sites. With the repulsion parameters, which have been proven to be suitable for low-energy consideration of graphene, we find a spin bond-ordered phase in the vicinity of the VHS. This phase gives way to a spin-density wave phase when involving a weak additional screening. The ground-state phase diagram is presented in the space of the doping level and the screening parameter. We describe in detail both of these spin-ordered states by using recently developed TUFRG + MF scheme, i.e., a combined approach of TUFRG and mean-field (MF) theory. The collinear states are energetically preferable in both cases of the spin bond order and the spin-density wave. But if the third-nearest neighbor hopping is absent, these spin orders become chiral. The band structures of two collinear spin-ordered states are presented, revealing the metallic behavior of the system.</description>

      <title>Fast gates for bit-flip protected superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits offer an unprecedentedly high degree of flexibility in terms of circuit encoding and parameter choices. However, in designing the qubit parameters one typically faces the conflicting goals of long coherence times and simple control capabilities. Both are determined by the wavefunction overlap of the qubit basis states and the corresponding matrix elements. Here, we address this problem by introducing a qubit architecture with real-time tunable bit-flip protection. In the first, the `heavy' regime, the energy relaxation time can be on the order of hours for fluxons located in two near-degenerate ground states, as recently demonstrated in Ref. [Hassani et al., Nat.~Commun.~14 (2023)]. The second, `light' regime, on the other hand facilitates high-fidelity control on nanosecond timescales without the need for microwave signals. We propose two different tuning mechanisms of the qubit potential and show that base-band flux-pulses of around 10 ns are sufficient to realize a universal set of high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. We expect that the concept of real-time wavefunction control can also be applied to other hardware-protected qubit designs.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a unique superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene characterized by its simultaneous emergence with both the anomalous Hall effect and stripe charge order. The onset of stripe charge order is revealed through angle-resolved transport measurements, which show thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis and highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Superconductivity develops exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, giving rise to a one-dimensional-like superconducting channel. This superconducting state exhibits first-order transitions under an out-of-plane magnetic field, consistent with a chiral order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Most remarkably, thermally driven superconducting transitions display pronounced hysteresis-an uncommon phenomenon that reflects the complex interplay among stripe formation, broken time-reversal symmetry, and superconductivity. Together, these results uncover a previously unidentified quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within an anomalous Hall crystal.</description>

Abstract: The CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits superconductivity in close proximity to a density-wave (DW) like ground state at ambient pressure\cite{Liu:2024aa}, however details of the DW is still elusive. Using first-principles density-functional calculations, we found its ground state to be a $4\times2$ altermagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) at ambient pressure, with an averaged effective moment of $\sim$1.7$\mu_B$/Cr. The magnetic long range order is coupled to the lattice, generating 4$a_0$ structural modulation. Multiple competing SDW phases are present and energetically close, suggesting strong magnetic fluctuation at finite temperature. The electronic states near Fermi level are dominated by Cr-3$d$ orbitals, and the kagome flat bands are closer to the Fermi level than those in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family in paramagnetic state. When external pressure is applied, the energy differences between competing orders and structural modulations are suppressed. Yet, the magnetic fluctuation remains present and important even at high pressure because the high-symmetry kagome lattice is unstable in nonmagnetic phase up to 30 GPa. Our results suggest the crucial role of magnetism to stabilize the crystal structure, under both ambient and high pressure.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nickelate superconductors have attracted a great deal of attention over the past few decades due to their similar crystal and electronic structures with high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</description>

      <title>Disorder effects in planar semiconductor-superconductor structures: Majorana wires versus Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder effects in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) nanowires, widely recognized as the main obstacle to realizing stable Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in these structures, have been systematically investigated theoretically in recent years. However, there are no corresponding detailed studies of disorder effects in planar Josephson junction (JJ) structures, which represent a promising alternative to the Majorana nanowire platform. In this paper, we perform a numerical analysis of the low-energy physics of JJ structures based on an effective microscopic model that includes two types of disorder, charge impurities inside the semiconductor and roughness on the surface of the superconducting film. We consider different parameter regimes, including low and high chemical potential values, weak and strong effective SM-SC coupling strengths, and weak and strong disorder strengths. The results are benchmarked using disordered hybrid nanowires realized in planar SM-SC structures similar to those involved in the fabrication of Josephson junctions and having similar model parameters and disorder strengths. We find that the topological superconducting phase hosted by a JJ structure is, generally, more robust against disorder than the topological superconductivity realized in a hybrid nanowire with similar parameters. On the other hand, we find that operating the JJ in a regime characterized by large values of chemical potential results in huge finite-size effects that can destroy the stability of MZMs.</description>

      <title>A Model for Topological p-wave Superconducting Wires with Disorder and Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A controllable theory of superconductivity due to strong repulsion in a polarized band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interactions be shown to give rise to pairing in a controllable way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction form factor is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. We illustrate our method with a two-band model that is often used to describe multi-layer rhombohedral graphene and comment on the relationship with experiments.</description>

      <title>Strain tuning of charge density wave and Mott-insulating states in monolayer VTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer vanadium ditelluride (VTe2) exhibits a 2\sqrt{3}*2\sqrt{3} charge density wave (CDW) order intertwined with a Mott-insulating state. However, the physical mechanisms driving the emergence of CDW order and Mott-insulating state are still not well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate the electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of monolayer VTe2 under applied biaxial strain. Our results reveal that the CDW phase is metastable in free-standing monolayer VTe2 and becomes stabilized under compressive strain below {\epsilon} = -2%. The formation of CDW order originates dominantly from strong EPC effect, rather than Fermi surface nesting. The narrowing of the bandwidth due to the CDW order, combined with the correlation effect of the V-3d orbital, collectively drives the system into a Mott-insulating state. Furthermore, we find that tensile strain suppresses CDW order and induces a superconducting state above a critical strain threshold ({\epsilon} = 2%). These findings enhance our understanding of correlation physics in monolayer VTe2 and provide a pathway for strain-engineered manipulation of quantum phases in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits the anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.</description>

      <title>Sub-micron Circuit Fabrication on Diamond Anvils for Mesoscopic High-Pressure Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to fault tolerant quantum computation using topological qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</description>
