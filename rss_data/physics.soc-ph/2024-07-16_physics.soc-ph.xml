      <title>Opinion formation under mass media influence on the Barabasi-Albert network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the dynamics of opinion formation under the influence of mass media using the $q$-voter model on a Barabasi-Albert network. We investigate the scenario where a voter adopts the mass media's opinion with a probability $p$ when there is no unanimity among a group of $q$ agents. Through numerical simulation, we identify a critical probability threshold, $p_t$, at which the system consistently reaches complete consensus. This threshold probability $p_t$ decreases as the group size $q$ increases, following a power-law relation $p_t \propto q^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \approx -1.187$. Additionally, we analyze the system's relaxation time, the time required to reach a complete consensus state. This relaxation time increases with the population size $N$, following a power-law $\tau \propto N^{\nu}$, where $\nu \approx 1.093$. Conversely, an increase in the probability $p$ results in a decrease in relaxation time following a power-law relationship $\tau \propto p^{\delta}$, with $\delta \approx -0.596$. The value of the exponent \( \nu \) is similar to the exponents obtained in the voter and $q$-voter models across various network topologies.</description>

      <title>Formation of human kinship structures depending on population size and cultural mutation rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does social complexity depend on population size and cultural transmission? Kinship structures in traditional societies provide a fundamental illustration, where cultural rules between clans determine people's marriage possibilities. Here we propose a simple model of kinship interactions that considers kin and in-law cooperation and sexual rivalry. In this model, multiple societies compete. Societies consist of multiple families with different cultural traits and mating preferences. These values determine interactions and hence the growth rate of families and are transmitted to offspring with mutations. Through a multilevel evolutionary simulation, family traits and preferences are grouped into multiple clans with inter-clan mating preferences. It illustrates the emergence of kinship structures as the spontaneous formation of interdependent cultural associations. Emergent kinship structures are characterized by the cycle length of marriage exchange and the number of cycles in society. We numerically and analytically clarify their parameter dependence. The relative importance of cooperation versus rivalry determines whether attraction or repulsion exists between families. Different structures evolve as locally stable attractors. The probabilities of formation and collapse of complex structures depend on the number of families and the mutation rate, showing characteristic scaling relationships. It is now possible to explore macroscopic kinship structures based on microscopic interactions, together with their environmental dependence and the historical causality of their evolution. We propose the basic causal mechanism of the formation of typical human social structures by referring to ethnographic observations and concepts from statistical physics and multilevel evolution. Such interdisciplinary collaboration will unveil universal features in human societies.</description>

      <title>Growth of Science: How long will the United States uphold its position?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policymakers often assess the growth of science in a country and compare it with that of other countries to set future planning for scientific research focusing on the sustainable development and economic growth of the country. Here, we study the growth of science for the period of 1996-2020 corresponding to the top fifty countries with the highest publications in 2020. It is found that the annual growth rates of scientific and technical journal publications exhibit Taylor's power law behavior indicating the dependence of the variance on the mean growth rate and the distributions of annual growth rates follow skew-symmetric distributions. Furthermore, we have computed the entropy based on annual publication numbers among the countries to assess the spatial disparity in the system. The entropy is found to increase mostly linear with time reducing the disparity among the countries. By performing the linear regression analysis, we predict that around the year 2046, all the countries excluding China may equally contribute towards the growth of science. We have also assessed the stability of the current USA ranking by computing the entropy between the USA and other countries. Based on the regression analysis, it is estimated that three potential countries such as Indonesia, India, and Iran may take the ranks ahead of the USA around the years 2024, 2029, and 2041 respectively.</description>

      <title>A Network Lens on Social Costs: Demolishing a Historic Street for a New Subway Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban redevelopment often involves a delicate balance between enhancing regional connectivity and preserving local social fabric. Through a case study in Guangzhou, China, we argue that demolishing a historic street to construct a new subway station shows competing interests between local government's priority to facilitate spatial connectivity and locals' priority to maintain a place for social interaction and memories. We measure the social costs of the new subway station through a network lens, focusing on the loss of social ties and memories and low travel benefits of the new station for the local populations. We find that 1) the demolition will remove many small businesses that support locals' daily activities, social ties, and memories, and 2) the new station reduces travel distance and increases route options for passengers from other areas of the city more than locals nearby the demolition site. Our results contribute to a network-based framework and methodology to understand and contest inequality in expanding transportation network infrastructure in cities.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Meso-Scale Structure in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key topic in network science is the detection of intermediate or meso-scale structures. Community, core-periphery, disassortative and other partitions allow us to understand the organisation and function of large networks. In this work we study under what conditions certain common meso-scale structures are detectable using the idea of block modularity. We find that the configuration model imposes strong restrictions on core-periphery and related structures in directed networks. We derive inequalities expressing when such structures can be detected under the configuration model. Nestedness is closely related to core-periphery and is similarly restricted to only be detectable under certain conditions. We show that these conditions are a generalisation of the resolution limit to structures other than assortative communities. We show how block modularity is related to the degree corrected Stochastic Block Model and that optimisation of one can be made equivalent to the other in general. Finally, we discuss these issues in inferential versus descriptive approaches to meso-scale structure detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Of the tens of thousands of particle accelerators in operation worldwide, the vast majority are not used for particle physics, but instead for applications. Some applications such as radiotherapy for cancer treatment are well-known, while others are more surprising: food irradiation using electron beams, or the hardening of road tarmac. The uses of particle beams are constantly growing in number including in medicine, industry, security, environment, and cultural heritage preservation. This lecture aims to give a broad sweep of the many uses of particle accelerators, covering technologies ranging in size from a few centimetres for industrial electron linacs through to large synchrotron light sources of hundreds of metres circumference operating as national and international facilities. We finish by discussing some of the challenges facing accelerators used in wider society.</description>

      <title>Astro-COLIBRI: Empowering Citizen Scientists in Time Domain Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, astronomy and astrophysics have experienced several fundamental changes. On one hand, there has been a significant increase in the observation of transient phenomena, which are short-lived events such as supernova explosions, fast radio bursts, and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, the detection of a growing number of different cosmic messengers provides researchers with crucial information about these objects. For example, the detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves regularly complements traditional astronomical observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. This trend is expected to intensify in the coming years with the commissioning of a wide variety of next-generation observatories, which will enable more in-depth studies of the transient sky.
  To enhance our understanding and optimize the observations of these phenomena, we have developed the Astro-COLIBRI platform. It is freely available to amateur and professional astronomers in the form of a smartphone application (iOS and Android), a web interface, an API, and a chatbot 'Astro-COLIBRI GPT', among many other features. Astro-COLIBRI serves as a central access point for information on astrophysical sources and transient events, allowing a wide network of observers to track and receive real-time alerts.
  Here we highlight the key features of Astro-COLIBRI, with a particular emphasis on recent innovations. These include a discussion forum that facilitates user interactions and our strengthened collaboration with various networks of amateur astronomers.</description>

      <title>The impact of social noise on the majority-rule model across various network topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of social noise, characterized by nonconformist behavior, on the phase transition within the framework of the majority-rule model. The order-disorder transition can reflect the consensus-polarization state in a social context. This study covers various network topologies, including complete graphs, two-dimensional (2-D) square lattices, three-dimensional (3-D) square lattices, and heterogeneous or complex networks such as Watts-Strogatz (W-S), Barab\'asi-Albert (B-A), and Erdos-R\'enyi (E-R) networks, as well as their combinations. Social behavior is represented by the parameter $p$, which indicates the probability of agents exhibiting nonconformist behavior. Our results show that the model exhibits a continuous phase transition across all networks. Through finite-size scaling analysis and evaluation of critical exponents, our results suggest that the model falls into the same universality class as the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional representation of semantic relations between physical theories, fundamental constants and units of measurement with formal concept analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose several hierarchical graphs that represent the semantic relations between physical theories, their fundamental constants and units of measurement. We begin with an alternative representation of Zelmanov's cube of fundamental constants as a concept lattice. We then propose the inclusion of a new fundamental constant: Milgrom's critical acceleration and discuss the implications of such analysis. We then look for the same fundamental constants in a graph that relates magnitudes and units of measurement in the International System of Units. This exercise shows the potential of visualizing hierarchical networks as a tool to better comprehend the interrelations and dependencies of physical magnitudes, units and theories. New regimes of application may be deduced, as well as an interesting reflection on our ontologies and corresponding theoretical objects.</description>

      <title>Why Teach Quantum In Your Own Time: The Values of Grassroots Organizations Involved in Quantum Technologies Education and Outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education. It delineates a fundamental distinction between the objective to provide education and the drive to democratize learning through principles of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.</description>

      <title>Uplifting edges in higher order networks: spectral centralities for non-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral analysis of networks states that many structural properties of graphs, such as centrality of their nodes, are given in terms of their adjacency matrices. The natural extension of such spectral analysis to higher order networks is strongly limited by the fact that a given hypergraph could have several different adjacency hypermatrices, hence the results obtained so far are mainly restricted to the class of uniform hypergraphs, which leaves many real systems unattended. A new method for analysing non-linear eigenvector-like centrality measures of non-uniform hypergraphs is presented in this paper that could be useful for studying properties of $\mathcal{H}$-eigenvectors and $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors in the non-uniform case. In order to do so, a new operation - the $\textit{uplift}$ - is introduced, incorporating auxiliary nodes in the hypergraph to allow for a uniform-like analysis. We later argue why this is a mathematically sound operation, and we furthermore use it to classify a whole family of hypergraphs with unique Perron-like $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors. We supplement the theoretical analysis with several examples and numerical simulations on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Surpassing legacy approaches to PWR core reload optimization with single-objective Reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the fuel cycle cost through the optimization of nuclear reactor core loading patterns involves multiple objectives and constraints, leading to a vast number of candidate solutions that cannot be explicitly solved. To advance the state-of-the-art in core reload patterns, we have developed methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for both single- and multi-objective optimization. Our previous research has laid the groundwork for these approaches and demonstrated their ability to discover high-quality patterns within a reasonable time frame. On the other hand, stochastic optimization (SO) approaches are commonly used in the literature, but there is no rigorous explanation that shows which approach is better in which scenario. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of our RL-based approach, specifically using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), against the most commonly used SO-based methods: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Parallel Simulated Annealing (PSA) with mixing of states, and Tabu Search (TS), as well as an ensemble-based method, Prioritized Replay Evolutionary and Swarm Algorithm (PESA). We found that the LP scenarios derived in this paper are amenable to a global search to identify promising research directions rapidly, but then need to transition into a local search to exploit these directions efficiently and prevent getting stuck in local optima. PPO adapts its search capability via a policy with learnable weights, allowing it to function as both a global and local search method. Subsequently, we compared all algorithms against PPO in long runs, which exacerbated the differences seen in the shorter cases. Overall, the work demonstrates the statistical superiority of PPO compared to the other considered algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Diffusive Epidemic Process with Permanent Immunity in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the generalized diffusive epidemic process, which is a metapopulation model for an epidemic outbreak where a non-sedentary population of walkers can jump along lattice edges with diffusion rates $D_S$ or $D_I$ if they are susceptible or infected, respectively, and recovered individuals possess permanent immunity. Individuals can be contaminated with rate $\mu_c$ if they share the same lattice node with an infected individual and recover with rate $\mu_r$, being removed from the dynamics. Therefore, the model does not have the conservation of the active particles composed of susceptible and infected individuals. The reaction-diffusion dynamics are separated into two stages: (i) Brownian diffusion, where the particles can jump to neighboring nodes, and (ii) contamination and recovery reactions. The dynamics are mapped into a growing process by activating lattice nodes with successful contaminations where activated nodes are interpreted as infection sources. In all simulations, the epidemic starts with one infected individual in a lattice filled with susceptibles. Our results indicate a phase transition in the dynamic percolation universality class controlled by the population size, irrespective of diffusion rates $D_S$ and $D_I$ and a subexponential growth of the epidemics in the percolation threshold.</description>
