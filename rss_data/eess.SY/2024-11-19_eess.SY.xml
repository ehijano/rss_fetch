      <title>AC-Informed DC Optimal Transmission Switching Problems via Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problems minimize operational costs while treating both the transmission line energization statuses and generator setpoints as decision variables. The combination of nonlinearities from an AC power flow model and discrete variables associated with line statuses makes AC-OTS a computationally challenging Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP). To address these challenges, the DC power flow approximation is often used to obtain a DC-OTS formulation expressed as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). However, this approximation often leads to suboptimal or infeasible switching decisions when evaluated with an AC power flow model. This paper proposes an enhanced DC-OTS formulation that leverages techniques for training machine learning models to optimize the DC power flow model's parameters. By optimally selecting parameter values that align flows in the DC power flow model with apparent power flows -- incorporating both real and reactive components -- from AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions, our method more accurately captures line congestion behavior. Integrating these optimized parameters into the DC-OTS formulation significantly improves the accuracy of switching decisions and reduces discrepancies between DC-OTS and AC-OTS solutions. We compare our optimized DC-OTS model against traditional OTS approaches, including DC-OTS, Linear Programming AC (LPAC)-OTS, and Quadratic Convex (QC)-OTS. Numeric results show that switching decisions from our model yield better performance when evaluated using an AC power flow model, with up to $44\%$ cost reductions in some cases.</description>

      <title>Self-Triggered Control in Artificial Pancreas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of type 1 diabetes has been revolutionized by the artificial pancreas system (APS), which automates insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM). While conventional closed-loop systems rely on CGM data, which leads to higher energy consumption at the sensors and increased data redundancy in the underlying communication network. In contrast, this paper proposes a self-triggered control mechanism that can potentially achieve lower latency and energy efficiency. The model for the APS consists of a state and input-constrained dynamical system affected by exogenous meal disturbances. Our self-triggered mechanism relies on restricting the state evolution within the robust control invariant of such a system at all times. To that end, using tools from reachability, we associate a safe time interval with such invariant sets, which denotes the maximum time for which the invariant set remains invariant, even without transmission of CGM data at all times.</description>

      <title>A Wearable Gait Monitoring System for 17 Gait Parameters Based on Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a shoe-mounted gait monitoring system capable of tracking up to 17 gait parameters, including gait length, step time, stride velocity, and others. The system employs a stereo camera mounted on one shoe to track a marker placed on the opposite shoe, enabling the estimation of spatial gait parameters. Additionally, a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) affixed to the heel of the shoe, combined with a custom-designed algorithm, is utilized to measure temporal gait parameters. Through testing on multiple participants and comparison with the gait mat, the proposed gait monitoring system exhibited notable performance, with the accuracy of all measured gait parameters exceeding 93.61%. The system also demonstrated a low drift of 4.89% during long-distance walking. A gait identification task conducted on participants using a trained Transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy on the dataset collected by the proposed system, demonstrating that our hardware has the potential to collect long-sequence gait data suitable for integration with current Large Language Models (LLMs). The system is cost-effective, user-friendly, and well-suited for real-life measurements.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Remote Synchronization: An Experimental Approach with Nonlinear Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates remote synchronization in arbitrary network clusters of coupled nonlinear oscillators, a phenomenon inspired by neural synchronization in the brain. Employing a multi-faceted approach encompassing analytical, numerical, and experimental methodologies, we leverage the Master Stability Function (MSF) to analyze network stability. We provide experimental evidence of remote synchronization between two clusters of nonlinear oscillators, where oscillators within each cluster are also remotely connected. This observation parallels the thalamus-mediated synchronization of neuronal populations in the brain. An electronic circuit testbed, supported by nonlinear ODE modeling and LT Spice simulation, was developed to validate our theoretical predictions. Future work will extend this investigation to encompass diverse network topologies and explore potential applications in neuroscience, communication networks, and power systems.</description>

      <title>Existence of $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibria in Nonzero-Sum Borel Stochastic Games and Equilibria of Quantized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing the existence of exact or near Markov or stationary perfect Nash equilibria in nonzero-sum Markov games over Borel spaces remains a challenging problem, with few positive results to date. In this paper, we establish the existence of approximate Markov and stationary Nash equilibria for nonzero-sum stochastic games over Borel spaces, assuming only mild regularity conditions on the model. Our approach involves analyzing a quantized version of the game, for which we provide an explicit construction under both finite-horizon and discounted cost criteria. This work has significant implications for emerging applications such as multi-agent learning. Our results apply to both compact and non-compact state spaces. For the compact state space case, we first approximate the standard Borel model with a finite state-action model. Using the existence of Markov and stationary perfect Nash equilibria for these finite models under finite-horizon and discounted cost criteria, we demonstrate that these joint policies constitute approximate Markov and stationary perfect equilibria under mild continuity conditions on the one-stage costs and transition probabilities. For the non-compact state space case, we achieve similar results by first approximating the model with a compact-state model. Compared with previous results in the literature, which we comprehensively review, we provide more general and complementary conditions, along with explicit approximation models whose equilibria are $\epsilon$-equilibria for the original model.</description>

      <title>Wildfire Risk Metric Impact on Public Safety Power Shut-off Cost Savings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are a proactive strategy to mitigate fire hazards from power system infrastructure failures. System operators employ PSPS to deactivate portions of the electric grid with heightened wildfire risks to prevent wildfire ignition and redispatch generators to minimize load shedding. A measure of vegetation flammability, called the Wildland Fire Potential Index (WFPI), has been widely used to evaluate the risk of nearby wildfires to power system operation. However, the WFPI does not correlate as strongly to historically observed wildfire ignition probabilities (OWIP) as WFPI-based the Large Fire Probability (WLFP).Prior work chose not to incorporate wildfire-driven failure probabilities, such as the WLFP, because constraints with Bernoulli random variables to represent wildfire ignitions could require non-linear or non-convex constraints. This paper uses a deterministic equivalent of an otherwise complicating line de-energization constraint by quantifying the wildfire risk of operating transmission line as a sum of each energized line's wildfire ignition log probability (log(WIP)) rather than as a sum of each energized line's WFPI. A day-ahead unit commitment and line de-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the cost differences driven by the choice between the WFPI and WLFP risk metrics. Training the optimization on scenarios developed by mapping WLFP to log(WIP) rather than mapping the WFPI to log(WIP) leads to reductions in the total real-time costs. For the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system, mapping transmission line WLFP values to log(WIP) resulted in a 14.8 % (on average) decrease in expected real-time costs.</description>

      <title>Immersion of General Nonlinear Systems Into State-Affine Ones for the Design of Generalized Parameter Estimation-Based Observers: A Simple Algebraic Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized parameter estimation-based observers have proven very successful to deal with systems described in state-affine form. In this paper, we enlarge the domain of applicability of this method proposing an algebraic procedure to immerse} an $n$-dimensional general nonlinear system into and $n_z$-dimensional system in state affine form, with $n_z&gt;n$. First, we recall the necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of the general problem, which requires the solution of a partial differential equation that, moreover, has to satisfy a restrictive injectivity condition. Given the complexity of this task we propose an alternative simple algebraic method to identify the required dynamic extension and coordinate transformation, a procedure that, as shown in the paper, is rather natural for physical systems. We illustrate the method with some academic benchmark examples from observer theory literature -- that, in spite of their apparent simplicity, are difficult to solve with the existing methods -- as well as several practically relevant physical examples.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally static procurement method to a dynamic strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to 37%) while keeping the total yearly procured FCR volume the same as compared to the current static approach.</description>

      <title>Iterative Learning Control for Ramp Metering on Service Station On-ramps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congestion on highways has become a significant social problem due to the increasing number of vehicles, leading to considerable waste of time and pollution. Regulating the outflow from the Service Station can help alleviate this congestion. Notably, traffic flows follow recurring patterns over days and weeks, allowing for the application of Iterative Learning Control (ILC). Building on these insights, we propose an ILC approach based on the Cell Transmission Model with service stations (CTM-s). It is shown that ILC can effectively compensate for potential inaccuracies in model parameter estimates by leveraging historical data.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Bitcoin Mining Machines in Demand-Response Mechanisms to Mitigate Ramping-Induced Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extended demand response program, based on ancillary service for supplying flexible electricity demand. In our proposed scheme, we suggest a broader management model to control the scheduling and power consumption of Bitcoin mining machines. The main aspect that we focus on is suppressing the power ramping and related transient effects. We extend previous works on the subject, that study the impact of incorporating cryptocurrency mining machines into existing power grid, and explore the potential profit of exploiting this flexible load in the Israeli electricity market. We analyze a trend based on historical data, of increasing electricity prices and ramping costs due to the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. We suggest an extension to the unit commitment problem from which we obtain the scheduling scheme of the Bitcoin mining machines. We use simulation and the real-world data acquired from the "Noga" grid operator to verify the proposed ancillary service and test its practical limits for reducing the ramping costs, under changing ratio of energy production from renewable sources. Out results suggests that the machine price and ratio of production from renewable sources plays a significant role in determining the profitability of the proposed demand-response program.</description>

      <title>Emergent Structure in Multi-agent Systems Using Geometric Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the self-organization of multi-agent systems into closed trajectories, a common requirement in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveillance tasks. In such scenarios, smooth, unbiased control signals save energy and mitigate mechanical strain. We propose a decentralized control system architecture that produces a globally stable emergent structure from local observations only; there is no requirement for agents to share a global plan or follow prescribed trajectories. Central to our approach is the formulation of an injective virtual embedding induced by rotations from the actual agent positions. This embedding serves as a structure-preserving map around which all agent stabilize their relative positions and permits the use of well-established linear control techniques. We construct the embedding such that it is topologically equivalent to the desired trajectory (i.e., a homeomorphism), thereby preserving the stability characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through implementation on a swarm of Quanser QDrone quadcopters. Results demonstrate the quadcopters self-organize into the desired trajectory while maintaining even separation.</description>

      <title>Robust Defense Against Extreme Grid Events Using Dual-Policy Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents are powerful tools for managing power grids. They use large amounts of data to inform their actions and receive rewards or penalties as feedback to learn favorable responses for the system. Once trained, these agents can efficiently make decisions that would be too computationally complex for a human operator. This ability is especially valuable in decarbonizing power networks, where the demand for RL agents is increasing. These agents are well suited to control grid actions since the action space is constantly growing due to uncertainties in renewable generation, microgrid integration, and cybersecurity threats. To assess the efficacy of RL agents in response to an adverse grid event, we use the Grid2Op platform for agent training. We employ a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm in conjunction with graph neural networks (GNNs). By simulating agents' responses to grid events, we assess their performance in avoiding grid failure for as long as possible. The performance of an agent is expressed concisely through its reward function, which helps the agent learn the most optimal ways to reconfigure a grid's topology amidst certain events. To model multi-actor scenarios that threaten modern power networks, particularly those resulting from cyberattacks, we integrate an opponent that acts iteratively against a given agent. This interplay between the RL agent and opponent is utilized in N-k contingency screening, providing a novel alternative to the traditional security assessment.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Automatic Electrical Machine Preliminary Design with Artificial Intelligence Expert Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven electrical machine design (EMD) framework using wound-rotor synchronous generator (WRSG) as a design example. Unlike traditional preliminary EMD processes that heavily rely on expertise, this framework leverages an artificial-intelligence based expert database, to provide preliminary designs directly from user specifications. Initial data is generated using 2D finite element (FE) machine models by sweeping fundamental design variables including machine length and diameter, enabling scalable machine geometry with machine performance for each design is recorded. This data trains a Metamodel of Optimal Prognosis (MOP)-based surrogate model, which maps design variables to key performance indicators (KPIs). Once trained, guided by metaheuristic algorithms, the surrogate model can generate thousands of geometric scalable designs, covering a wide power range, forming an AI expert database to guide future preliminary design. The framework is validated with a 30kVA WRSG design case. A prebuilt WRSG database, covering power from 10 to 60kVA, is validated by FE simulation. Design No.1138 is selected from database and compared with conventional design. Results show No.1138 achieves a higher power density of 2.21 kVA/kg in just 5 seconds, compared to 2.02 kVA/kg obtained using traditional method, which take several days. The developed AI expert database also serves as a high-quality data source for further developing AI models for automatic electrical machine design.</description>

      <title>Network-Security Informed Offer-Making of Aggregator with Utility-Owned Storage Lease Opportunity: Stochastic Stackelberg Game and Distributed Solution Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregators of distributed energy resources are increasingly encouraged to participate in wholesale market bidding. However, the delivery of the power they are awarded can result in over-voltage or congestion issues within the distribution network (DN). The opportunity to lease energy storage from the utility that manages the DN provides the aggregator with a means to mitigate these issues, while also benefiting the utility in terms of additional lease revenue. Nevertheless, this leasing opportunity considerably complicates the aggregator's offer-making process, as it requires the consideration of market uncertainties, uncertain power injection at DN buses, and the strategic interactions between the aggregator and the utility. This paper presents a stochastic Stackelberg game model that effectively captures the interactions between the aggregator and the utility, ensuring DN security across all potential uncertainty scenarios. Furthermore, in light of the privacy concerns of both the aggregator and the utility, two distributed solution methods are proposed. The first method follows a traditional predict-then-optimize framework and has been validated to achieve the game equilibrium. The second method employs an end-to-end framework, which has been empirically shown to yield superior economic results. Case studies conducted on 69 and 533-bus DNs illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Mitigating Sim2Real Gaps: A Formal Quantitative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of simulation-gap functions to formally quantify the potential gap between an approximate nominal mathematical model and the high-fidelity simulator representation of a real system. Given a nominal mathematical model alongside a quantified simulation gap, the system can be conceptualized as one characterized by bounded states and input-dependent disturbances. This allows us to leverage the existing powerful model-based control algorithms effectively, ensuring the enforcement of desired specifications while guaranteeing a seamless transition from simulation to real-world application. To provide a formal guarantee for quantifying the simulation gap, we develop a data-driven approach. In particular, we collect data using high-fidelity simulators, leveraging recent advancements in Real-to-Sim transfer to ensure close alignment with reality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on a nonlinear pendulum system and a nonlinear Turtlebot model in simulators.</description>

      <title>Distributed Learning with Partial Information Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the distributed learning process on a network of agents. Agents make partial observation about an unknown hypothesis and iteratively share their beliefs over a set of possible hypotheses with their neighbors to learn the true hypothesis. We present and analyze a distributed learning algorithm in which agents share belief on only one randomly chosen hypothesis at a time. Agents estimate the beliefs on missed hypotheses using previously shared beliefs. We show that agents learn the true hypothesis almost surely under standard network connectivity and observation model assumptions if belief on each hypothesis is shared with positive probability at every time. We also present a memory-efficient variant of the learning algorithm with partial belief sharing and present simulation results to compare rate of convergence of full and partial information sharing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reduced Network Cumulative Constraint Violation for Distributed Bandit Convex Optimization under Slater Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying inequality constraints, where the goal is to minimize network regret and cumulative constraint violation. To calculate network cumulative constraint violation, existing distributed bandit online algorithms solving this problem directly use the clipped constraint function to replace its original constraint function. However, the use of the clipping operation renders Slater condition (i.e, there exists a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints at all iterations) ineffective to achieve reduced network cumulative constraint violation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new distributed bandit online primal-dual algorithm. If local loss functions are convex, we show that the proposed algorithm establishes sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. When Slater condition holds, the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced. In addition, if local loss functions are strongly convex, for the case where strongly convex parameters are unknown, the network regret bound is reduced. For the case where strongly convex parameters are known, the network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds are further reduced. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to establish reduced (network) cumulative constraint violation bounds for (distributed) bandit convex optimization with time-varying constraints under Slater condition. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we study contraction of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and contraction rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</description>

      <title>Integrating and Comparing Radiality Constraints for Optimized Distribution System Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfiguration of electrical power distribution systems is a crucial optimization problem aimed at minimizing power losses by altering the system topology through the operation of interconnection switches. This problem, typically modelled as a mixed integer nonlinear program demands high computational resources for large scale networks and requires specialized radiality constraints for maintaining the tree like structure of distribution networks. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis that integrates and compares the computational burden associated with different radiality constraint formulations proposed in the specialized literature for the reconfiguration of distribution systems. By using consistent hardware and software setups, we evaluate the performance of these constraints across several well known test cases. Our findings reveal significant differences in computational efficiency depending on the chosen set of radiality constraints, providing valuable insights for optimizing reconfiguration strategies in practical distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Approximate predictive control barrier function for discrete-time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose integrating an explicit approximation of a predictive control barrier function (PCBF) in a safety filter framework. The approximated PCBF is implicitly defined through an optimal control problem and allows guaranteeing invariance of an implicitly defined safe set as well as stability of this safe set within a larger domain of attraction. By extending existing theoretical analysis of the PCBF, we establish inherent robustness of the original algorithm and translate the guarantees to input-to-state stability of the proposed algorithm with respect to possible approximation errors, recovering the same guarantees in the absence of approximation errors. The proposed algorithm allows certifying inputs with respect to state constraint satisfaction through a single function evaluation and filtering unsafe inputs through a control barrier function based safety filter, which is independent of the time horizon of the original predictive optimisation problem, resulting in significant online computational benefits. We demonstrate the stability properties of the proposed algorithm on a linear system example as well as its use a fast safety filter for miniature race cars in simulation.</description>

      <title>On the Incorporation of Stability Constraints into Sequential Operational Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), power system stability constraints must be incorporated into the operational framework, transforming it into stability-constrained optimization. Currently, there exist parallel research efforts on developing the stability constraints within DC power flow-based unit commitment (UC) and AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF). However, few studies discuss how including such constraints can interact with each other and eventually impact grid stability. In this context, this work simulates a realistic power system decision making framework and provides a thorough analysis on the necessity of incorporating frequency nadir and small signal stability constraints into these sequentially connected two operation stages. The simulation results demonstrate that including both stability constraints in the UC is essential to maintain power system stability, while the inclusion in AC OPF can further improve the stability index.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of Opinion Dynamics and Recommendation System: Modeling Analysis and Reinforcement Learning Based Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a recommendation system. By incorporating elements such as collaborative filtering, we provide a precise characterization of how recommendation systems shape interpersonal interactions and influence opinion formation. Moreover, the property of the coevolution of both opinion dynamics and recommendation systems is also shown. Specifically, the convergence of this coevolutionary system is theoretically proved, and the mechanisms behind filter bubble formation are elucidated. Our analysis of the maximum number of opinion clusters shows how recommendation system parameters affect opinion grouping and polarization. Additionally, we incorporate the influence of propagators into our model and propose a reinforcement learning-based solution. The analysis and the propagation solution are demonstrated in simulation using the Yelp data set.</description>

      <title>Design And Optimization Of Multi-rendezvous Manoeuvres Based On Reinforcement Learning And Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing space vehicle routing is crucial for critical applications such as on-orbit servicing, constellation deployment, and space debris de-orbiting. Multi-target Rendezvous presents a significant challenge in this domain. This problem involves determining the optimal sequence in which to visit a set of targets, and the corresponding optimal trajectories: this results in a demanding NP-hard problem. We introduce a framework for the design and refinement of multi-rendezvous trajectories based on heuristic combinatorial optimization and Sequential Convex Programming. Our framework is both highly modular and capable of leveraging candidate solutions obtained with advanced approaches and handcrafted heuristics. We demonstrate this flexibility by integrating an Attention-based routing policy trained with Reinforcement Learning to improve the performance of the combinatorial optimization process. We show that Reinforcement Learning approaches for combinatorial optimization can be effectively applied to spacecraft routing problems. We apply the proposed framework to the UARX Space OSSIE mission: we are able to thoroughly explore the mission design space, finding optimal tours and trajectories for a wide variety of mission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Distribution System Network Reconfiguration Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High penetration from volatile renewable energy resources in the grid and the varying nature of loads raise the need for frequent line switching to ensure the efficient operation of electrical distribution networks. Operators must ensure maximum load delivery, reduced losses, and the operation between voltage limits. However, computations to decide the optimal feeder configuration are often computationally expensive and intractable, making it unfavorable for real-time operations. This is mainly due to the existence of binary variables in the network reconfiguration optimization problem. To tackle this issue, we have devised an approach that leverages machine learning techniques to reshape distribution networks featuring multiple substations. This involves predicting the substation responsible for serving each part of the network. Hence, it leaves simple and more tractable Optimal Power Flow problems to be solved. This method can produce accurate results in a significantly faster time, as demonstrated using the IEEE 37-bus distribution feeder. Compared to the traditional optimization-based approaches, a feasible solution is achieved approximately ten times faster for all the tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalable control synthesis for stochastic systems via structural IMDP abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel abstraction-based framework for controller synthesis of nonlinear discrete-time stochastic systems. The focus is on probabilistic reach-avoid specifications. The framework is based on abstracting a stochastic system into a new class of robust Markov models, called orthogonally decoupled Interval Markov Decision Processes (odIMDPs). Specifically, an odIMDPs is a class of robust Markov processes, where the transition probabilities between each pair of states are uncertain and have the product form. We show that such a specific form in the transition probabilities allows one to build compositional abstractions of stochastic systems that, for each state, are only required to store the marginal probability bounds of the original system. This leads to improved memory complexity for our approach compared to commonly employed abstraction-based approaches. Furthermore, we show that an optimal control strategy for a odIMDPs can be computed by solving a set of linear problems. When the resulting strategy is mapped back to the original system, it is guaranteed to lead to reduced conservatism compared to existing approaches. To test our theoretical framework, we perform an extensive empirical comparison of our methods against Interval Markov Decision Process- and Markov Decision Process-based approaches on various benchmarks including 7D systems. Our empirical analysis shows that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both memory requirements and the conservatism of the results.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Stochastic Extremum-Seeking Control for Multivariable Systems with Distinct Input Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design and analysis of a multivariable gradient-based stochastic extremum-seeking control method for multi-input systems with arbitrary input delays. The approach accommodates systems with distinct time delays across input channels and achieves local exponential stability of the closed-loop system, guaranteeing convergence to a small neighborhood around the extremum point. By incorporating phase compensation for dither signals and a novel predictor-feedback mechanism with averaging-based estimates of the unknown gradient and Hessian, the proposed method overcomes traditional challenges associated with arbitrary, distinct input delays. Unlike previous work on deterministic multiparameter extremum-seeking with distinct input delays, this stability analysis is achieved without using backstepping transformations, simplifying the predictor design and enabling a more straightforward implementation. Specifically, the direct application of Artstein's reduction approach results in delay- and system-dimension-independent convergence rates, enhancing practical applicability. A numerical example illustrates the robust performance and advantages of the proposed delay-compensated stochastic extremum-seeking method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with sliding mode control for multivariable polytopic uncertain systems. We provide systematic procedures to design variable structure controllers (VSCs) and unit-vector controllers (UVCs). Based on suitable representations for the closed-loop system, we derive sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to design the robust sliding mode controllers such that the origin of the closed-loop system is globally stable in finite time. Moreover, by noticing that the reaching time depends on the initial condition and the decay rate, we provide convex optimization problems to design robust controllers by considering the minimization of the reaching time associated with a given set of initial conditions. Two examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>A Novel MLLM-based Approach for Autonomous Driving in Different Weather Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) technology promises to revolutionize daily transportation by making it safer, more efficient, and more comfortable. Their role in reducing traffic accidents and improving mobility will be vital to the future of intelligent transportation systems. Autonomous driving in harsh environmental conditions presents significant challenges that demand robust and adaptive solutions and require more investigation. In this context, we present in this paper a comprehensive performance analysis of an autonomous driving agent leveraging the capabilities of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) using GPT-4o within the LimSim++ framework that offers close loop interaction with the CARLA driving simulator. We call it MLLM-AD-4o. Our study evaluates the agent's decision-making, perception, and control under adverse conditions, including bad weather, poor visibility, and complex traffic scenarios. Our results demonstrate the AD agent's ability to maintain high levels of safety and efficiency, even in challenging environments, underscoring the potential of GPT-4o to enhance autonomous driving systems (ADS) in any environment condition. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of MLLM-AD-4o when different perception entities are used including either front cameras only, front and rear cameras, and when combined with LiDAR. The results of this work provide valuable insights into integrating MLLMs with AD frameworks, paving the way for future advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Allocation with Collaborative Distributed and Centralized DRL under Control Channel Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a wireless resource allocation problem in a cyber-physical system (CPS) where the control channel, carrying resource allocation commands, is subjected to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We propose a novel concept of collaborative distributed and centralized (CDC) resource allocation to effectively mitigate the impact of these attacks. To optimize the CDC resource allocation policy, we develop a new CDC-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, whereas existing DRL frameworks only formulate either centralized or distributed decision-making problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the CDC-DRL algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks, showcasing its ability to address resource allocation problems in large-scale CPSs under control channel attacks.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Study of Liquid Condensation on Nano-structured Sinusoidal Hybrid Wetting Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although real surfaces exhibit intricate topologies at the nanoscale, rough surface consideration is often overlooked in nanoscale heat transfer studies. Superimposed sinusoidal functions effectively model the complexity of these surfaces. This study investigates the impact of sinusoidal roughness on liquid argon condensation over a functional gradient wetting (FGW) surface with 84% hydrophilic content using molecular dynamics simulations. Argon atoms are confined between two platinum substrates: a flat lower substrate heated to 130K and a rough upper substrate at 90K. Key metrics of the nanoscale condensation process, such as nucleation, surface heat flux, and total energy per atom, are analyzed. Rough surfaces significantly enhance nucleation, nearly doubling cluster counts compared to smooth surfaces and achieving a more extended atomic density profile with a peak of approximately and improved heat flux. Stronger atom-surface interactions also lead to more efficient energy dissipation. These findings underscore the importance of surface roughness in optimizing condensation and heat transfer, offering a more accurate representation of surface textures and a basis for designing surfaces that achieve superior heat transfer performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Soft Actor-Critic Framework for RIS-Assisted and UAV-Aided Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore UAV-assisted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to enhance downlink communications in wireless networks. By integrating RIS on both UAVs and ground infrastructure, we aim to boost network coverage, fairness, and resilience against challenges such as UAV jitter. To maximize the minimum achievable user rate, we formulate a joint optimization problem involving beamforming, phase shifts, and UAV trajectory. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive soft actor-critic (ASAC) framework. In this approach, agents are built using adaptive sparse transformers with attentive feature refinement (ASTAFER), enabling dynamic feature processing that adapts to real-time network conditions. The ASAC model learns optimal solutions to the coupled subproblems in real time, delivering an end-to-end solution without relying on iterative or relaxation-based methods. Simulation results demonstrate that our ASAC-based approach achieves better performance compared to the conventional SAC. This makes it a robust, adaptable solution for real-time, fair, and efficient downlink communication in UAV-RIS networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Robot Metabolism: Towards machines that can grow by consuming other machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological lifeforms can heal, grow, adapt, and reproduce -- abilities essential for sustained survival and development. In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. A key challenge to such physical adaptation has been that while robot minds are rapidly evolving new behaviors through AI, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate new material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using only a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shedding broken components. We demonstrate this principle using a truss modular robot platform composed of one-dimensional actuated bars. We show how robots in this space can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and from other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes akin to the one demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legged-aerial multimodal robots can make the most of both legged and aerial systems. In this paper, we propose a control framework that bypasses heavy onboard computers by using an optimization-free Explicit Reference Governor that incorporates external thruster forces from an attitude controller. Ground reaction forces are maintained within friction cone constraints using costly optimization solvers, but the ERG framework filters applied velocity references that ensure no slippage at the foot end. We also propose a Conjugate momentum observer, that is widely used in Disturbance Observation to estimate ground reaction forces and compare its efficacy against a constrained model in estimating ground reaction forces in a reduced-order simulation of Husky.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Momentum-Based Estimation of External Forces for Bio-Inspired Morphing Wing Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic morphing wing flights present significant challenges in accurately estimating external forces due to complex interactions between aerodynamics, rapid wing movements, and external disturbances. Traditional force estimation methods often struggle with unpredictable disturbances like wind gusts or unmodeled impacts that can destabilize flight in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses these challenges by implementing a Conjugate Momentum-based Observer, which effectively estimates and manages unknown external forces acting on the Aerobat, a bio-inspired robotic platform with dynamically morphing wings. Through simulations, the observer demonstrates its capability to accurately detect and quantify external forces, even in the presence of Gaussian noise and abrupt impulse inputs. The results validate the robustness of the method, showing improved stability and control of the Aerobat in dynamic environments. This research contributes to advancements in bio-inspired robotics by enhancing force estimation for flapping-wing systems, with potential applications in autonomous aerial navigation and robust flight control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical framework to solve robot planning as an input control problem. At the lowest level are temporary closed control loops, ("tasks"), each representing a behaviour, contingent on a specific sensory input and therefore temporary. At the highest level, a supervising "Configurator" directs task creation and termination. Here resides "core" knowledge as a physics engine, where sequences of tasks can be simulated. The Configurator encodes and interprets simulation results,based on which it can choose a sequence of tasks as a plan. We implement this framework on a real robot and test it in an overtaking scenario as proof-of-concept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static structured control refers to the task of designing a state-feedback controller such that the control gain satisfies a subspace constraint. Structured control has applications in control of communication-inhibited dynamical systems, such as systems in networked environments. This work performs $H_2$-suboptimal regulation under a common structured state-feedback controller for a class of data-consistent plants. The certification of $H_2$-performance is attained through a combination of standard $H_2$ LMIs, convex sufficient conditions for structured control, and a matrix S-lemma for set-membership. The resulting convex optimization problems are linear matrix inequalities whose size scales independently of the number of data samples collected. Data-driven structured $H_2$-regulation control is demonstrated on example systems.</description>

      <title>Sound Value Iteration for Simple Stochastic Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic analysis of Markov decision processes (MDP) and stochastic games (SG) in practice relies on value-iteration (VI) algorithms. Since the basic version of VI does not provide guarantees on the precision of the result, variants of VI have been proposed that offer such guarantees. In particular, sound value iteration (SVI) not only provides precise lower and upper bounds on the result, but also converges faster in the presence of probabilistic cycles. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable to SG, nor to MDP with end components. In this paper, we extend SVI and cover both cases. The technical challenge consists mainly in proper treatment of end components, which require different handling than in the literature. Moreover, we provide several optimizations of SVI. Finally, we also evaluate our prototype implementation experimentally to confirm its advantages on systems with probabilistic cycles.</description>

      <title>Exploring LLMs for Verifying Technical System Specifications Against Requirements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Requirements engineering is a knowledge intensive process and crucial for the success of engineering projects. The field of knowledge-based requirements engineering (KBRE) aims to support engineers by providing knowledge to assist in the elicitation, validation, and management of system requirements. The advent of large language models (LLMs) opens new opportunities in the field of KBRE. This work experimentally investigates the potential of LLMs in requirements verification. Therein, LLMs are provided with a set of requirements and a textual system specification and are prompted to assess which requirements are fulfilled by the system specification. Different experimental variables such as system specification complexity, the number of requirements, and prompting strategies were analyzed. Formal rule-based systems serve as a benchmark to compare LLM performance to. Requirements and system specifications are derived from the smart-grid domain. Results show that advanced LLMs, like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieved f1-scores between 79 % and 94 % in identifying non-fulfilled requirements, indicating potential for LLMs to be leveraged for requirements verification.</description>

      <title>Carleman-Fourier Linearization of Complex Dynamical Systems: Convergence and Explicit Error Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Carleman-Fourier linearization method for nonlinear dynamical systems with periodic vector fields involving multiple fundamental frequencies. By employing Fourier basis functions, the nonlinear dynamical system is transformed into a linear model on an infinite-dimensional space. The proposed approach yields accurate approximations over extended regions around equilibria and for longer time horizons, compared to traditional Carleman linearization with monomials. Additionally, we develop a finite-section approximation for the resulting infinite-dimensional system and provide explicit error bounds that demonstrate exponential convergence to the original system's solution as the truncation length increases. For specific classes of dynamical systems, exponential convergence is achieved across the entire time horizon. The practical significance of these results lies in guiding the selection of suitable truncation lengths for applications such as model predictive control, safety verification through reachability analysis, and efficient quantum computing algorithms. The theoretical findings are validated through illustrative simulations.</description>

      <title>A New Finite-Horizon Dynamic Programming Analysis of Nonanticipative Rate-Distortion Function for Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the computation of a non-asymptotic lower bound by means of the nonanticipative rate-distortion function (NRDF) on the discrete-time zero-delay variable-rate lossy compression problem for discrete Markov sources with per-stage, single-letter distortion. First, we derive a new information structure of the NRDF for Markov sources and single-letter distortions. Second, we derive new convexity results on the NRDF, which facilitate the use of Lagrange duality theorem to cast the problem as an unconstrained partially observable finite-time horizon stochastic dynamic programming (DP) algorithm subject to a probabilistic state (belief state) that summarizes the past information about the reproduction symbols and takes values in a continuous state space. Instead of approximating the DP algorithm directly, we use Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find an implicit closed-form expression of the optimal control policy of the stochastic DP (i.e., the minimizing distribution of the NRDF) and approximate the control policy and the cost-to-go function (a function of the rate) stage-wise, via a novel dynamic alternating minimization (AM) approach, that is realized by an offline algorithm operating using backward recursions, with provable convergence guarantees. We obtain the clean values of the aforementioned quantities using an online (forward) algorithm operating for any finite-time horizon. Our methodology provides an approximate solution to the exact NRDF solution, which becomes near-optimal as the search space of the belief state becomes sufficiently large at each time stage. We corroborate our theoretical findings with simulation studies where we apply our algorithms assuming time-varying and time-invariant binary Markov processes.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Cornering Control and Real-Vehicle Deployment for Autonomous Electric Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executing drift maneuvers during high-speed cornering presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles, yet offers the potential to minimize turning time and enhance driving dynamics. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in simulated environments, discrepancies between simulations and real-world conditions have limited its practical deployment. This study introduces an innovative control framework that integrates trajectory optimization with drift maneuvers, aiming to improve the algorithm's adaptability for real-vehicle implementation. We leveraged Bezier-based pre-trajectory optimization to enhance rewards and optimize the controller through Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) in a simulated environment. For real-world deployment, we implement a hybrid RL-MPC fusion mechanism, , where TD3-derived maneuvers serve as primary inputs for a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). This integration enables precise real-time tracking of the optimal trajectory, with MPC providing corrective inputs to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. The efficacy of this method is validated through real-vehicle tests on consumer-grade electric vehicles, focusing on drift U-turns and drift right-angle turns. The control outcomes of these real-vehicle tests are thoroughly documented in the paper, supported by supplementary video evidence (https://youtu.be/5wp67FcpfL8). Notably, this study is the first to deploy and apply an RL-based transient drift cornering algorithm on consumer-grade electric vehicles.</description>

Abstract: Wing-assisted inclined running (WAIR) observed in some young birds, is an attractive maneuver that can be extended to legged aerial systems. This study proposes a control method using a modified Variable Length Inverted Pendulum (VLIP) by assuming a fixed zero moment point and thruster forces collocated at the center of mass of the pendulum. A QP MPC is used to find the optimal ground reaction forces and thruster forces to track a reference position and velocity trajectory. Simulation results of this VLIP model on a slope of 40 degrees is maintained and shows thruster forces that can be obtained through posture manipulation. The simulation also provides insight to how the combined efforts of the thrusters and the tractive forces from the legs make WAIR possible in thruster-assisted legged systems.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of dynamical networks modeled by linear and time-invariant systems which are described by state-space realizations. For these networks, we investigate the relations between various types of factorizations which preserve the structure of their component subsystems' interconnection. In doing so, we provide tractable means of shifting between different types of sparsity-preserving representations and we show how to employ these factorizations to obtain distributed implementations for stabilizing and possibly stable controllers. By formulating all these results for both discrete- and continuous-time systems, we develop specialized distributed implementations that, up to this point, were only available for networks modeled as discrete-time systems.</description>

By efficiently utilizing linepack, the natural gas system can provide flexibility to the power system through the flexible operation of gas-fired power plants. This requires accurately representing the gas flow physics governed by partial differential equations. Although several modeling and solution choices have been proposed in the literature, their impact on the flexibility provision of gas networks to power systems has not been thoroughly analyzed and compared. This paper bridges this gap by first developing a unified framework. We harmonize existing approaches and demonstrate their derivation from and application to the partial differential equations. Secondly, based on the proposed framework, we numerically analyze the implications of various modeling and solution choices on the flexibility provision from gas networks to power systems. One key conclusion is that relaxation-based approaches allow charging and discharging the linepack at physically infeasible high rates, ultimately overestimating the flexibility.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Control for a Class of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Generalized Time-Varying Output Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel control framework to address the satisfaction of multiple time-varying output constraints in uncertain high-order MIMO nonlinear control systems. Unlike existing methods, which often assume that the constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can handle coupled time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential infeasibilities. First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints essentially boils down to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable, representing the signed distance from the boundary of the time-varying output-constrained set. To achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is designed that, when satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the time-varying output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a novel robust and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the satisfaction of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a mechanism for online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a least violating solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for some time. Finally, simulation examples of trajectory and region tracking for a mobile robot validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Improved Tangential Interpolation-based Multi-input Multi-output Modal Analysis of a Full Aircraft</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of Structural Dynamics, modal analysis is the foundation of System Identification and vibration-based inspection. However, despite their widespread use, current state-of-the-art methods for extracting modal parameters from multi-input multi-output (MIMO) frequency domain data are still affected by many technical limitations. Mainly, they can be computationally cumbersome and/or negatively affected by close-in-frequency modes. The Loewner Framework (LF) was recently proposed to alleviate these problems with the limitation of working with single-input data only. This work proposes a computationally improved version of the LF, or iLF, to extract modal parameters more efficiently. Also, the proposed implementation is extended in order to handle MIMO data in the frequency domain. This new implementation is compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the frequency domain implementations of the Least Square Complex Exponential method and the Numerical Algorithm for Subspace State Space System Identification on numerical and experimental datasets. More specifically, a finite element model of a 3D Euler-Bernoulli beam is used for the baseline comparison and the noise robustness verification of the proposed MIMO iLF algorithm. Then, an experimental dataset from MIMO ground vibration tests of a trainer jet aircraft with over 91 accelerometer channels is chosen for the algorithm validation on a real-life application. Its validation is carried out with known results from a single-input multi-output dataset of the starboard wing of the same aircraft. Excellent results are achieved in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational performance by the proposed improved MIMO method, both on the numerical and the experimental datasets. The MIMO iLF MATLAB implementation is shared in the work supplementary material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsed light sources are a critical component of modern lithography, with fine light beam wavelength control paramount for wafer etching accuracy. We study optimal wavelength control by casting it as a decentralized linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem in presence of time-delays. In particular, we consider the multi-optics module (optics and actuators) used for generating the requisite wavelength in light sources as cooperatively interacting systems defined over a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We show that any measurement and other continuous time-delays can be exactly compensated, and the resulting optimal controller implementation at the individual optics-level outperforms any existing wavelength control techniques.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Mode Decomposition for Finite Discrete Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an orthogonal mode decomposition method is proposed to decompose ffnite length real signals on both the real and imaginary axes of the complex plane. The interpolation function space of ffnite length discrete signal is constructed, and the relationship between the dimensionality of the interpolation function space and its subspaces and the band width of the interpolation function is analyzed. It is proved that the intrinsic mode is actually the narrow band signal whose intrinsic instantaneous frequency is always positive (or always negative). Thus, the eigenmode decomposition problem is transformed into the orthogonal projection problem of interpolation function space to its low frequency subspace or narrow band subspace. Different from the existing mode decomposition methods, the orthogonal modal decomposition is a local time-frequency domain algorithm. Each operation extracts a speciffc mode. The global decomposition results obtained under the precise deffnition of eigenmodes have uniqueness and orthogonality. The computational complexity of the orthogonal mode decomposition method is also much smaller than that of the existing mode decomposition methods.</description>

      <title>Design of Distributed Controller for Discrete-Time Systems Via the Integration of Extended LMI and Clique-Wise Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses a design of distributed controllers for discrete-time systems using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Sparsity constraints on control gains of distributed controllers result in conservatism via the convexification of the existing methods such as the extended LMI method. In order to mitigate the conservatism, we introduce a novel LMI formulation for this problem, utilizing the clique-wise decomposition method from our previous work on continuous-time systems. By reformulating the sparsity constraint on the gain matrix within cliques, this method achieves a broader solution set. Also, the analytical superiority of our method is confirmed through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Social Equity Based Optimal Power Flow Framework to Hedge Against Price Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing frequency of high impact low probability events, electricity markets are experiencing significant price spikes more often. This paper proposes a novel social equity driven optimal power flow framework to mitigate the adverse effects of price events that lead to such price spikes. The framework integrates social welfare optimization with socioeconomic considerations by including a socioeconomic score that quantifies the energy burden and socioeconomic status of consumers. By incorporating both supply cost and consumer satisfaction, the model aims to achieve a balanced and fair distribution of resources during price events, while considering resource scarcity and possible load curtailment. The proposed framework is tested for convergence on modified versions of the PJM 5-bus system and IEEE 24-bus reliability test system, discussing its potential effectiveness in enhancing social equity and optimizing power flow under system security constraints. Sensitivity analysis further highlights the impact of socioeconomic score on social welfare, providing insights for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Sliding Mode Roll Control of Active Suspension Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle roll control has been a well studied problem. One of the ubiquitous methods to mitigate vehicle rollover in the automobile industry is via a mechanical anti-roll bar. However with the advent of electric vehicles, rollover mitigation can be pursued using electric actuation. In this work, we study a roll control algorithm using sliding mode control for active suspension vehicles, where the actuation for the roll control signal is generated by electric motors independently at the four corners of the vehicle. This technology precludes the need for any mechanical actuation which is often slower as well as any anti-roll bar to mitigate vehicle rollover situations. We provide an implementation of the proposed algorithm and conduct numerical experiments to validate the functionality and effectiveness. Specifically, we perform Slalom and J-turn maneuvering tests on an active suspension electric vehicle with sliding model roll control and it is shown to mitigate rollover by atleast 50% compared to passive suspension vehicles, while simultaneously maintaining rider comfort.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Neyman-Pearson Detection to Combat Strategic Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security in networked systems depends greatly on recognizing and identifying adversarial behaviors. Traditional detection methods focus on specific categories of attacks and have become inadequate for increasingly stealthy and deceptive attacks that are designed to bypass detection strategically. This work aims to develop a holistic theory to countermeasure such evasive attacks. We focus on extending a fundamental class of statistical-based detection methods based on Neyman-Pearson's (NP) hypothesis testing formulation. We propose game-theoretic frameworks to capture the conflicting relationship between a strategic evasive attacker and an evasion-aware NP detector. By analyzing both the equilibrium behaviors of the attacker and the NP detector, we characterize their performance using Equilibrium Receiver-Operational-Characteristic (EROC) curves. We show that the evasion-aware NP detectors outperform the passive ones in the way that the former can act strategically against the attacker's behavior and adaptively modify their decision rules based on the received messages. In addition, we extend our framework to a sequential setting where the user sends out identically distributed messages. We corroborate the analytical results with a case study of anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>SupplyGraph: A Benchmark Dataset for Supply Chain Planning using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction across different domains such as transportation, bio-informatics, language processing, and computer vision. However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

      <title>Extremum Seeking is Stable for Scalar Maps that are Strictly but Not Strongly Convex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a map that is strictly but not strongly convex, model-based gradient extremum seeking has an eigenvalue of zero at the extremum, i.e., it fails at exponential convergence. Interestingly, perturbation-based model-free extremum seeking has a negative Jacobian, in the average, meaning that its (practical) convergence is exponential, even though the map's Hessian is zero at the extremum. While these observations for the gradient algorithm are not trivial, we focus in this paper on an even more nontrivial study of the same phenomenon for Newton-based extremum seeking control (NESC).
  NESC is a second-order method which corrects for the unknown Hessian of the unknown map, not only in order to speed up parameter convergence, but also (1) to make the convergence rate user-assignable in spite of the unknown Hessian, and (2) to equalize the convergence rates in different directions for multivariable maps. Previous NESC work established stability only for maps whose Hessians are strictly positive definite everywhere, so the Hessian is invertible everywhere. For a scalar map, we establish the rather unexpected property that, even when the map behind is strictly convex but not strongly convex, i.e., when the Hessian may be zero, NESC guarantees practical asymptotic stability, semiglobally. While a model-based Newton-based algorithm would run into non-invertibility of the Hessian, the perturbation-based NESC, surprisingly, avoids this challenge by leveraging the fact that the average of the perturbation-based Hessian estimate is always positive, even though the actual Hessian may be zero.</description>

      <title>Scalable spectral representations for multi-agent reinforcement learning in network MDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a popular model for multi-agent control, pose a significant challenge to efficient learning due to the exponential growth of the global state-action space with the number of agents. In this work, utilizing the exponential decay property of network dynamics, we first derive scalable spectral local representations for network MDPs, which induces a network linear subspace for the local $Q$-function of each agent. Building on these local spectral representations, we design a scalable algorithmic framework for continuous state-action network MDPs, and provide end-to-end guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of our scalable representation-based approach on two benchmark problems, and demonstrate the advantages of our approach over generic function approximation approaches to representing the local $Q$-functions.</description>

      <title>Tunable Sub-THz and THz lasing effect using FETs at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I report on the first observed self-amplification by stimulated emission of 0.2THz and 1.63THz radiation using InGaAs/GaAs HEMT operating in the deep saturation regime at room temperature. I demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the Sub-THz and THz FETs response is due to rectification of the nonlinear dependence of the device current-voltage characteristics. FETs do operate as a nonlinear THz mixers and rectifiers and its open-drain responsivity is given by a similar expression to that of zero-bias Schottky diode detector. However, operating FETs deep in the saturation regime does allow the accurate tuning of the device to the resonance condition or the negative resistance mode at room temperature, hence FETs can be tuned in the deep saturation regime to enable sub-THz and THz lasing effect. This observed sub-THz and THz laser phenomena using FETs will revolutionize human technology in all fields of life in the near future.</description>
