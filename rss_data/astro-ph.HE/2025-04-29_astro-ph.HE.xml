      <title>Investigating the ground energy distribution of particles produced in extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectra of particles arriving at the ground is a significant observable in the analysis of extensive air showers (EAS). Energy distributions at ground were studied for primary particles (12C,56Fe, p, and 28Si) with high primary energies (10^17, 10^18, 10^19, and 10^20 eV) from two zenith angles (0 and 30 Deg.). 960 EAS were simulated using the Monte-Carlo program Aires (version 19.04.00) with three models of hadronic interaction (EPOS-LHC, QGSJET-II-04, and Sibyll2.3c). Good agreement was obtained by comparing the present results with results simulated using CORSIKA for primary iron at an energy of 10^20 eV. In this study we investigated various secondary particles that arrive at the ground and deposit a portion of their energy on ground detectors. These results show that the distinction in energy distribution at ground is greater for primary protons than carbon, iron, or silicon nuclei at higher energies and steeper zenith angles.</description>

      <title>IGR J12580+0134: The Nearest Tidal Disruption Event and its Faint Resurrection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are X-ray and gamma-ray radiations emerging from the tidal disintegration of a star or substellar object that passes too close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy. In November 2010, a TDE designated as IGR J12580+0134 occurred in the galaxy NGC 4845, which was traced by follow-up XMM-Newton observations in January 2011. To identify a further TDE based on the radio outburst cycle, we requested NICER monitoring observations for nearly a year beginning in March 2023, which we studied here along with the previous XMM-Newton observations. We analyzed X-ray brightness changes using hardness analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), and conducted spectral analysis of the source continuum. The NICER observations revealed the presence of some X-ray flares during March--June 2023, which were much fainter than the TDE observed using XMM-Newton in 2011. The PCA component that mainly contributes to the X-ray outbursts during the TDE is a heavily absorbed power-law continuum emission, whereas there is a small contribution from collisionally ionized plasma in the soft excess, likely from a colliding wind or jet. Similarly, the PCA of the NICER data relates the X-ray flares to a power-law spectrum, albeit with a much lower absorbing column, and partially to soft collisional plasma. The faint X-ray flares captured by NICER could be associated with extremely weak accretion onto the SMBH resident in this galaxy, and thus, potentially a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>An explanation for the radio variation associated with the Vela pulsar glitch occurred on December 12 2016</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elaborate observation of the single radio pulses of Vela pulsar around the pulsar glitch that occurred on December 12, 2016 reveals that the physical mechanism associated with this glitch exert a profound influence on the pulsar's magnetosphere. According to the evolution of these pulses, we propose a scenario regarding how the pulsar magnetic field might undergo alterations within the framework of the inner gap model. We deduce that the liberation of the free energy within Vela pulsar results in the emergence of new magnetic multipole components. The progressively developing multipole components cause the magnetic field lines in a section of the polar cap region to become increasingly curved, ultimately resulting in the observed pulse broadening and pulse missing. At last, we discuss the possible connection between magnetic variations and fast radio bursts according to the inspiration of the presented picture.</description>

      <title>Repeated Tidal Interactions between Stars and Supermassive Black Holes: Mass Transfer, Stability, and Implications for Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars orbiting supermassive black holes can generate recurring accretion flares in repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we develop an efficient formalism for analyzing the time-dependent response of a star to the removal of a fraction ($\lesssim 10\%$) of its mass. This model predicts that mass loss results in a decrease in the average density of low-mass ($\lesssim 0.7 M_{\odot}$) stars. Contrarily, higher-mass stars increase in density, such that the change is more pronounced for larger mass losses, and stars with masses $\sim 1.5-2 M_{\odot}$ experience the largest such increase. We predict that the final energy of the star post-mass-loss (i.e., the ``surviving core'') is effectively given by the binding energy of the original star interior to the radius from which mass is removed, i.e., the final core energy is agnostic to the process that removes the mass and -- as a corollary -- tidal heating is comparatively insignificant. We find excellent agreement between our predictions and one-dimensional Eulerian simulations of a star undergoing mass loss, and three-dimensional Lagrangian simulations of partial TDEs. We conclude that 1) partially disrupted stars are not significantly heated via tidal dissipation, 2) evolved and moderately massive ($\gtrsim 1.5 M_{\odot}$) stars can most readily survive many repeated stripping events, and 3) progressively dimmer flares -- observed in some repeating partial TDE candidates -- could be explained by the increase in the density of the star post-mass-loss.</description>

      <title>Validation and Calibration of Semi-Analytical Models for the Event Horizon Telescope Observations of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables the exploration of black hole accretion flows at event-horizon scales. Fitting ray-traced physical models to EHT observations requires the generation of synthetic images, a task that is computationally demanding. This study leverages \alinet, a generative machine learning model, to efficiently produce radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) images as a function of the specified physical parameters. \alinet has previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models.</description>

      <title>GReX: An Instrument Overview and New Upper Limits on the Galactic FRB Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the instrument design and initial results for the Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX), an all-sky monitor for exceptionally bright transients in the radio sky. This instrument builds on the success of STARE2 to search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the Milky Way and its satellites. This instrument has deployments across the globe, with wide sky coverage and searching down to $32\,\mu\text{s}$ time resolution, enabling the discovery of new super giant pulses. Presented here are the details of the hardware and software design of the instrument, performance in sensitivity and other key metrics, and experience in building a global-scale, low-cost experiment. We follow this discussion with experimental results on validation of the sensitivity via hydrogen-line measurements. We then update the rate of Galactic FRBs based on a non-detection in $0.5\,\text{sky}\,\text{yr}$ of exposure, with twice the sensitivity of STARE2. Our results suggest FRB-like events are even rarer than initially implied by the detection of a MJy burst from SGR J1935+2154 in April 2020.</description>

      <title>High energy extragalactic multimessenger backgrounds from starburst and dead galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starburst galaxies are $\gamma$-ray sources. Canonically, their emission is driven by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) interacting with interstellar gas, forming $\gamma$-rays via the decay of neutral pions. Charged pions are also formed in this process. They decay into secondary leptons, including electrons and neutrinos. Starburst galaxies are therefore also expected to be neutrino sources, and their high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission may include a secondary leptonic component. Leptonic $\gamma$-rays may also originate from electrons directly energized by shocks within the interstellar medium of galaxies, or from pulsars and their surrounding halos. In the Milky Way, pulsars/pulsar halos are the dominant $\gamma$-ray source class. They are associated with stellar remnants or old stellar populations, and are presumably abundant in old galaxies. In this work, we show that the collective high-energy emission from galaxies can account for only a fraction of extragalactic neutrinos, but can form a major component of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. Contrary to the traditional view, a substantial fraction of this radiation may originate from leptonic processes, including from old, quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>Rotation and Dispersion Measure Evolution of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts Propagating through a Magnetar Flare Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation measure (RM) and dispersion measure (DM) are characteristic properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) that contain important information of their source environment. The time evolution of RM and DM is more inclined to be ascribed to local plasma in the host galaxy rather than the intergalactic medium or free electrons in the Milky Way. Recently a sudden drastic RM change was reported for an active repeating FRB 20220529, implying that some kind of mass ejection happened near the source. In this work I suggest that magnetar flare ejecta could play this role and give rise to the significant RM change. I introduce a toy structured ejecta model and calculate the contribution to RM and DM by a typical flare event. I find that this model could reproduce the RM behaviour of FRB 20220529 well under reasonable parameters, and similar sudden change is expected as long as this source maintains its activity.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Propagation in the Milky Way and the Associated Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of Galactic CR transport were performed with the software GALPROP, with the resulting gamma-ray flux calculated up to the PeV regime. The impact of altering parameters such as the number and distribution of CR sources, the distribution of infrared radiation between stars, and the distribution and strength of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), were investigated. For the first time the modelling variation in the TeV predictions due to uncertainties in the Galactic distributions was quantified. Additionally, the modelling variation from considering a stochastic placement of the CR sources was quantified up to 1 PeV. The simulation results were compared to the most detailed Galactic TeV gamma-ray survey: the H.E.S.S. Galactic plane survey (HGPS). The GALPROP predictions were broadly compatible with the large-scale emission from the HGPS after accounting for both the catalogued sources and estimates of the unresolved source fraction. At 1 TeV the gamma-ray emission from CR electrons was found to contribute $\sim$50\% to the large-scale emission. The GMF was found to be an important modelling consideration above 1 TeV as it impacted the large-scale emission by approximately a factor of two. Additionally, the CR electron flux at Earth above 1 TeV was found to vary by over a factor of ten over a period of a few million years due. The GALPROP models were found to agree with observations of the diffuse gamma rays in the TeV regime by H.E.S.S., and the PeV regime by LHAASO, extending the demonstrated accuracy of GALPROP into the TeV--PeV regime. The results will also inform the next generation of experiments, such as the Cherenkov telescope array (CTA), on possible observation strategies and background considerations. It was also found that the proposed CTA Galactic plane survey will be sensitive enough to observe the large-scale diffuse gamma-ray emission in the TeV regime.</description>

      <title>Flare genesis in relativistic jet: Disentangling the drivers of variability in the blazar 4C +27.50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, blazar 4C +27.50 was found to be flaring in gamma-rays since its detection with Fermi-LAT in 2008. For the first time, a dedicated temporal and spectral study of the blazar 4C +27.50 has been performed in this work to understand the nature of this object. We used the Bayesian block algorithm to identify four flaring states and one quiet state in the 2-year-long Fermi-LAT light curve. Simultaneous broadband flaring episodes have been observed, and a significant correlation is seen between optical and $\gamma$-ray emission, suggesting the co-spatial origin of the broadband emission. The variation of fractional variability amplitude with respect to frequency shows a nearly double hump structure similar to broadband SED. The fastest flux doubling time in the 1-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve is found to be about 7.8 hours. A curvature in $\gamma$-ray spectra has been observed, possibly caused by a stochastic particle acceleration process rather than radiative cooling. No evident correlation was found in the $\gamma$-ray flux-index plot, but a clear harder-when-brighter trend is observed in the X-ray flux-index plot. A one-zone leptonic model has been implemented to understand broadband emission during the quiet and flaring states, and the variation of the jet parameters is been investigated. A gradual increment in BLR and Disk energy density has been observed from a quiet to the flaring state. Broadband SED modeling suggested that an enhancement in the magnetic field, particle energy, and bulk Lorentz factor might have caused the flaring events.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT observations of the extremely bright GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\insight) detected GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst observed to date, with all its three telescopes, i.e. High Energy telescope (HE, 20-250 keV), Medium Energy telescope (ME, 5-30 keV), and Low Energy telescope (LE, 1-10 keV). Here we present the detailed observation results of all three telescopes of \insight~ on the prompt emission of GRB 221009A. After dead-time and data saturation correction, we recovered the light curves of HE, ME and LE telescopes and find that they generally track the GECAM-C low gain light curves that are free of data saturation issues. Particularly, the ME light curve matches the GECAM-C light curve in low gain mode above 400 keV, while the LE light curve is more consistent with the GECAM-C above 1.5 MeV. Based on simulation, we find that the signals recorded by the ME and LE are actually caused by the secondary particles produced by the interaction between GRB gamma-ray photons and the material of the satellite. Interestingly, the consistency between ME and LE light curves and GECAM-C demonstrates that ME and LE data could be used to characterize the GRB properties. Espeically, the high time resolution light curve of ME allowed us, for the first time, to calculate the minimum variability timescale (MVT = 0.10 s) of the main burst episode of GRB 221009A.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields and black hole mergers with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale (i.e., $\gtrsim {\rm kpc}$) and micro-Gauss scale magnetic fields have been observed throughout the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. These fields depend on the geometry and matter-energy composition, can display complicated behavior such as direction reversals, and are intimately related to the evolution of the source galaxy. Simultaneously, gravitational-wave astronomy offers a new probe into astrophysical systems, for example the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe the mergers of massive (i.e., $M ~&gt; 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$) black-hole binaries and provide extraordinary constraints on the evolution of their galactic hosts. In this work, we show how galactic, large-scale magnetic fields and their electromagnetic signatures are connected with LISA gravitational-wave observations via their common dependence on the massive black-hole binary formation scenario of hierarchical galaxy mergers. Combining existing codes, we astrophysically evolve a population of massive binaries from formation to merger and find that they are detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 10^3$ which is correlated with quantities from the progenitors' phase of circumbinary disk migration such as the maximum magnetic field magnitude $|\mathbf{B}| \approx 7 \,\mu$G, polarized intensity, and Faraday rotation measure. Interesting correlations result between these observables arising from their dependencies on the black-hole binary total mass, suggesting a need for further analyses of the full parameter space. We conclude with a discussion on this new multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Propagation of UHE cosmic rays in the light of f(R) gravity power-law model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the origins of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) remain shrouded in uncertainty, several important milestones have been reached in recent years in the experimental study of CRs with energy above 1018 eV. Within the vast expanse of intergalactic space, turbulent magnetic fields (TMFs) are believed to pervade, and these fields could exert a significant influence on the journey of UHECRs across the expanding Universe, which is currently undergoing acceleration. Thus, it is imperative to incorporate these considerations into our theoretical framework to gain a deeper understanding of the empirical observations related to UHECRs. In light of this, our research delves into the impact of UHE particle diffusion in the presence of TMFs, all within the context of the f(R) gravity power-law model. Based on this f(R) model, we explore the diffusive behavior of UHECR protons, particularly focusing on their density enhancement throughout their propagation and their energy spectrum. We found that the f(R) gravity model considered here plays an effective role in the propagation of CRs and the results have lain within our range of interest. Also, we compare our results for flux with observational data like the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and Telescope Array (TA).</description>

      <title>Neutrino Constraints on Black Hole Formation in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino signals associated with black hole formation resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, motivated by the candidate failed supernova M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). By compiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the expected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational limits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic precursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino energy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \&amp; Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS. These findings demonstrate the capability of neutrino astronomy to probe core collapse and black hole formation in failed supernova scenarios.</description>

      <title>What Determines the Maximum Mass of AGN-assisted Black Hole Mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of merging binary black holes detected through gravitational waves remains a fundamental question in astrophysics. While stellar evolution imposes an upper mass limit of about 50 solar mass for black holes, some observed mergers--most notably GW190521--involve significantly more massive components, suggesting alternative formation channels. Here we investigate how heavy black holes merging within Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) disks can become. Using a comprehensive semi-analytic model incorporating 27 binary and environmental parameters, we explore the role of AGN disk conditions in shaping the upper end of the black hole mass spectrum. We find that AGN disk lifetime is the dominant factor, with high-mass mergers (&gt;200 solar mass) only possible if disks persist for ~40 Myr. The joint electromagnetic observation of an AGN-assisted merger could therefore lead to a direct measurement of the age of an AGN disk.</description>

      <title>On Neutron Star Natal Kicks in High-Mass X-Ray Binaries: Insights from Population Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of neutron stars (NSs) in the Galaxy is largely dependent on natal kicks received by the NSs during supernova explosions. Thus, the measured peculiar velocities of NS high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) provide valuable clues to natal kicks, which also play an important role in the evolution of HMXBs. In this work, we collect proper motions, radial velocities and parallaxes for 36 NS HMXBs to derive their peculiar velocities at the birth of the NSs. We then use binary population synthesis to simulate the velocities of NS HMXBs with various choices of the kick velocity distribution for both core-collapse and electron-capture supernovae. Comparing the simulated and measured velocities, orbital periods, and eccentricities, we show that the natal kick distribution that can best match the observations is characterized by a bimodal Maxwellian distribution with $\sigma_1$ = 320 km s$^{-1}$ (for core-collapse supernovae) and $\sigma_2$ = 80 km s$^{-1}$ (for electron-capture supernovae) and the He core mass for the latter in the range of $(1.83-2.25)$ $M_{\odot}$. Our findings provide useful insights for further population synthesis and binary evolution studies of NS binaries.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron Circular Polarization in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Optical Emission: Relativistic Thermal Electron Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron circular polarization of a non-thermal power-law electron distribution in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been studied. However, some numerical simulations have shown that the resulting distribution of electrons is a combination of a thermal component and a non-thermal power-law component. In this paper, we investigate synchrotron circular polarization using such a hybrid energy distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons within a globally toroidal magnetic field in GRB prompt optical emission. Our results show that compared to the solely nonthermal electron model, the synchrotron circular polarization degree (PD) in the hybrid electron model can vary widely in the optical band, depending on different parameters. The lower the electron temperature, the higher the circular PD. The time-averaged circular PD in the hybrid electron model can be higher than $\sim 1\%$ when the electron temperature is as low as $\sim 10^{10}$ K, while in the solely nonthermal electron model is usually lower than $\sim 1\%$. We further calculate the radiative transfer of the circular and linear polarization in the optical band. Our results show that both of the circular and linear PDs decrease with the increase of optical depth, but the linear PDs decline faster than the circular PDs. To further examine the physical mechanisms of both radiation and particle acceleration, we expect that instruments will be capable of measuring the circular polarization of GRB prompt optical emission in the future.</description>

      <title>Tracing the ejecta structure of SN 1987A: Insights and diagnostics from 3D MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A provides a unique window into the aftermath of a massive stellar explosion, offering key insights into the ejecta's morphology, composition, explosion mechanism, progenitor system, and circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. We investigate large-scale ejecta asymmetries in SN 1987A. By comparing the simulations with JWST observations and making predictions for XRISM, we aim to refine our understanding of the explosion mechanism and the remnant's evolution. We performed 3D MHD simulations that trace the evolution of SN 1987A from the SN to the SNR, extending our predictions up to 5000 years into the future and considering the Ni-bubble effects. The simulation results are compared with JWST observations and used to predict XRISM spectra, to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled ejecta structure. Our simulations reproduce the large-scale Fe-rich ejecta morphology seen by JWST, revealing two clumps suggestive of a bipolar explosion. Ni-bubble effects in the first year boost Fe-rich ejecta expansion and their interaction with the reverse shock. However, discrepancies with JWST observations in clump velocities and spatial distribution suggest stronger explosion asymmetries than modeled. Since 2021, our models predict that shocked ejecta have contributed increasingly to X-ray emission, now rivaling shocked CSM and soon dominating as the latter fades. Future XRISM observations will trace the evolution of these ejecta structures, refining constraints on explosion geometry. Early remnant asymmetries from CSM interaction may persist for at least 100 years. Our results underscore the role of asymmetric core-collapse mechanisms in shaping SN 1987A's ejecta and constraining its explosion geometry. Future studies should explore more extreme asymmetries, in neutrino-driven core collapse or magneto-rotational SN models, to identify the origin of its bipolar Fe-rich structure.</description>

      <title>The Dust Echo Emission of Fast Blue Optical Transients and Application to the Near-Infrared Excess of AT 2018cow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A near-infrared (NIR) excess has been discovered in the emission of the representative fast blue optical transient (FBOT): AT 2018cow. It was suggested that this NIR excess could be emitted by the dust surrounding the source and, thus, could provide a probe into the nature of its progenitor. We develop a model to describe the influence of the FBOT emission on the environmental dust and, as a result, a dust-free evaporation cavity can be formed on a timescale of one day. Outside this cavity, the surviving dust grains can have different size distributions at different distances to the source. With such a special dust environment, we fit the multi-wavelength light curves of AT 2018cow by taking into account the evolutionary dust echo of the FBOT emission. It is found that the dust temperature can vary with time along with the evolution of the irradiating FBOT emission. Even at a fixed time, the dust temperature can be distributed in a wide range rather than having only a unique value. Furthermore, both the mass of the dust shell and its distance to the FBOT are found to be much larger than those derived with a direct empirical fitting of the NIR spectra but without considering the evolutionary relationship between the spectra.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Identification of Gravimentally Microlensed Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provides a unique opportunity to probe compact dark matter and small-scale structures in the universe. However, identifying such microlensed GRBs within large datasets is a significant challenge. In this study, we develop a machine learning approach to distinguish Lensed GRBs from their Non-lensed counterparts using simulated light curves. A comprehensive dataset was generated, comprising labeled light curves for both categories. Features were extracted using the Cesium package, capturing critical temporal properties of the light curves. Multiple machine learning models were trained on the extracted features, with Random Forest achieving the best performance, delivering an accuracy of 94\% and an F1 score of 95\% (94\%) for Non-Lensed (Lensed) class. This approach successfully demonstrates the potential of machine learning for identifying gravitational lensing in GRBs, paving the way for future observational applications.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton Observations of the High Temperature Plasma in the Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant N132D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the archival XMM-Newton observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supernova remnant N132D totaling more than 500ks. We focus on the high temperature plasma ($kt\sim 4.5$keV) that is responsible for the high energy continuum and exciting the Fe K emission. An image analysis shows that the Fe K emission is mainly concentrated in the southern part of the remnant interior to the region defined by the forward shock. This Fe K distribution would be consistent with an asymmetric distribution of the Fe ejecta and/or an asymmetric interaction between the reverse shock and the Fe ejecta. We compare the EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS spectra in the 3.0 -- 12.0keV bandpass with a model based on RGS data plus a higher temperature component, in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE), or non-equilibrium (NEI) (both ionizing and recombining). We find that the data are equally well-fitted by the CIE and ionizing models. Assuming the CIE and ionizing spectral models, the Fe in this high temperature component is significantly enhanced with respect to typical LMC abundances. We can place only an upper limit on the neutral Fe K line. We conclude that the Fe~K emission is due to ejecta heated by the reverse shock given the spatial distribution, relatively high temperature, and enhanced abundance. We estimate the progenitor mass based on the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe mass ratios to be $13\le M_P \le 15 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Explosive production of Higgs particles and implications for heavy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely believed that the parameter space for Higgs-portal dark matter that achieves the relic abundance through thermal freeze-out has already been tightly constrained, typically at masses on the order of ${\cal O}(10-100)$ GeV. We point out the possibility that the multiple Higgs production due to its self-interaction dramatically changes this picture. We show that the multiplicity can be as large as ${\cal O}(200)$ for the parameters of the Standard Model Higgs, independently of the kinematics of the particle production process. Consequently, heavy Higgs-portal dark matter of $m_\chi\gtrsim{\cal O}(1)$ TeV can achieve the required relic abundance in the same mechanism with that for canonical weakly interacting massive particle models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from eccentric binary neutron star mergers: Systematic biases induced by quasi-circular templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of quasi-circular waveforms in matched-filter analyses of signals from eccentric binary neutron star mergers can lead to biases in the source's parameter estimation. We demonstrate that significant biases can be present already for moderate eccentricities $e_{0} \gtrsim 0.05$ and LIGO-Virgo-Kagra signals with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 12$. We perform systematic Bayesian mock analyses of unequal-mass non-spinning binary neutron star signals up to eccentricities $e_0 \sim 0.1$ using quasi-circular effective-one-body waveforms with spins. We find fractional signal-to-noise ratio losses up to tens of percent and up to 16-$\sigma$ deviations in the inference of the chirp mass. The latter effect is sufficiently large to lead to an incorrect (and ambiguous) source identification. The inclusion of spin precession in the quasi-circular waveform does not capture eccentricity effects. We conclude that high-precision observations with advanced (and next generation) detectors are likely to require standardized, accurate, and fast eccentric waveforms.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: II. Time-domain and frequency-domain models for nonspinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect$\unicode{x2014}$a permanent shift in the GW strain that arises from nonlinear GW interactions in the wave zone$\unicode{x2014}$is a prediction of general relativity which has not yet been observed. The amplitude of the GW memory effect from binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers is small compared to that of primary (oscillatory) GWs and is unlikely to be detected by current ground-based detectors. Evidence for its presence in the population of all the BBH mergers is more likely, once thousands of detections are made by these detectors. Having an accurate and computationally efficient waveform model of the memory signal will assist detecting the memory effect with current data-analysis pipelines. In this paper, we build on our prior work to develop analytical time-domain and frequency-domain models for the dominant nonlinear memory multipole signal ($l=2$, $m=0$) from nonspinning BBH mergers in quasicircular orbits. The model is calibrated for mass ratios between one and eight. There are three parts to the time-domain signal model: a post-Newtonian inspiral, a quasinormal-mode-based ringdown, and a phenomenological signal during the late inspiral and merger (which interpolates between the inspiral and ringdown). The time-domain model also has an analytical Fourier transform, which we compute in this paper. We assess the accuracy of our model using the mismatch between our waveform model and the memory signal computed from the oscillatory modes of a numerical-relativity surrogate model. We use the advanced LIGO sensitivity curve from the fourth observing run and find that the mismatch increases with the total mass of the system and is of order $10^{-2}\unicode{x2013}10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamical simulations-based model that connects the FRB DM--redshift relation to suppression of the matter power spectrum via feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of baryonic feedback on the small-scale ($k \gtrsim 1\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) matter power spectrum is a key astrophysical challenge, and essential for interpreting data from upcoming weak-lensing surveys, which require percent-level accuracy to fully harness their potential. Astrophysical probes, such as the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, have been used to constrain feedback at large scales ($k \lesssim 5\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$). The sightline-to-sightline variance in the fast radio bursts (FRBs) dispersion measure (DM) correlates with the strength of baryonic feedback and offers unique sensitivity at scales upto $k \sim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. We develop a new simulation-based formalism in which we parameterize the distribution of DM at a given redshift, $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$, as a log-normal with its first two moments computed analytically in terms of cosmological parameters and the feedback-dependent electron power spectrum $P_\mathrm{ee}(k, z)$. We find that the log-normal parameterization provides an improved description of the $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$ distribution observed in hydrodynamical simulations as compared to the standard $F$-parameterization. Our model robustly captures the baryonic feedback effects across a wide range of baryonic feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamical simulations, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Astrid. Leveraging simulations incorporates the redshift evolution of the DM variance by construction and facilitates the translation of constrained feedback parameters to the suppression of matter power spectrum relative to gravity-only simulations. We show that with $10^4$ FRBs, the suppression can be constrained to percent-level precision at large scales and $\sim 10$\% precision at scales $k \gtrsim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ with prior-to-posterior $1\sigma$ constraint width ratio $\gtrsim 20$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Energy Expansion with Strange Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Chromodynamics phase diagram at large densities and low temperature can be probed both by neutron stars and low-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy-ion collisions are nearly isospin symmetric systems whereas neutron stars are highly isospin asymmetric since they are neutron-rich. The symmetry energy expansion is used to connect these regimes across isospin asymmetry. However, the current symmetry energy expansion does not account for strange particles. Here we include a finite strangeness to calculate isospin asymmetry and find that the symmetry energy expansion has a skewness term in the presence of strangeness for the case of weak equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Precision Determination of Scintillation Screen Parameters from Annual Modulation Measurement of Pulsar Scintillation Arc Curvature with the FAST Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar scintillation observations have revealed ubiquitous discrete scintillation screens in the interstellar medium. A major obstacle in identifying the nature of these screens is the uncertainty in their distances, which prevents precise correlation with known structures in the Milky Way. We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe PSR B1237+25, PSR 1842+14, and PSR 2021+51. We detected 10 scintillation arcs in PSR B1237+25, 1 in PSR 1842+14, and at least 6 in PSR 2021+51. By modeling the annual modulation of these scintillation arcs, we constrained the distances of the scintillation screens, as well as the anisotropic scattering directions and the projected velocities in those directions. The scintillation screens are distributed throughout the entire paths between Earth and the pulsars. Among these, the distance to the main scintillation screen toward PSR B1237+25 is $267^{+32}_{-28}$ pc, the scintillation screen toward PSR B1842+14 is at a distance of $240^{+210}_{-120}$ pc, and the main scintillation screen toward PSR B2021+51 is located at $887^{+167}_{-132}$ pc. Several screens in our sample appear at distances coinciding with the Local Bubble boundary, particularly the brightest scintillation arc toward PSR B1237+25. We provide a substantial sample of scintillation screen measurements, revealing the rich plasma density fluctuation structures present in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>CGM cloud sizes from refractive FRB scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore constraints on the size of cool gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtainable from the presence, or lack thereof, of refractive scattering in fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our refractive analysis sets the most conservative bounds on parsec-scale CGM clumpiness as it does not make assumptions about the turbulent density cascade. We find that the bulk of low-redshift cool CGM gas, constrained to have densities of $n_{\rm e} \lesssim 10^{-2}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, likely cannot produce two refractive images and, hence, scattering. It is only for extremely small cloud sizes $\lesssim 0.1$ pc (about a hundred times smaller than the so-called shattering scale) that such densities could result in detectable scattering. Dense $n_{\rm e} \gtrsim 0.1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ gas with shattering-scale cloud sizes is more likely to inhabit the inner several kiloparsecs of the low-redshift CGM: such clouds would result in multiple refractive images and large scattering times $\gtrsim 1 - 10$ ms, but a small fraction FRB sightlines are likely to be affected. We argue that such large scattering times from an intervening CGM would be a signature of sub-parsec clouds, even if diffractive scattering from turbulence contributes to the overall scattering. At redshift $z\sim 3$, we estimate $\sim 0.1\%$ of FRBs to intersect massive proto-clusters, which may be the most likely place to see scattering owing to their ubiquitous $n_{\rm e} \approx 1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ cold gas. While much of our discussion assumes a single cloud size, we show similar results hold for a CGM cloud-size distribution motivated by hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moment-Field Interactions, A Universal Mechanism for Particle Energization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a pivotal mechanisms in the energization and heating of cosmic plasmas, yet the exact process of energy transfer during these events remain elusive. Traditional models, which focus on acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves and micro/nano-flares, fall short of explaining the extreme heating of the solar corona and the origins of the supersonic solar wind. In this study, we provide compelling observational evidence from Wind spacecraft data supporting the Raghav effect, a mechanism where interactions between the magnetic moments of charged particles and dynamic magnetic fields result in abrupt kinetic energy changes. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed proton plasma heating is consistent with theoretical predictions, establishing the Raghav effect as a universal mechanism for particle energization. This discovery offers a unified framework for understanding energy dynamics across a wide range of astrophysical magnetised plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Recovery in Giant Eruptions of Massive Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant Eruptions (GEs) are episodic high-rate mass loss events that massive stars experience in the late stage of evolutions before exploding as a core-collapse supernova. If it occurs in a binary system, the companion star can accrete part of the mass. We use numerical simulations to analyze how the companion responds to accretion and how its structure and evolution are altered. We run a grid of massive stars with masses from $20~\rm M_{\odot}$ to $60~\rm M_{\odot}$, and accretion rates from $\rm 10^{-4}$ to $\rm 0.1~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, over a duration of $20$ yrs. For accretion rates $\rm \lesssim 0.01~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ the star remains on the hotter side of the HR diagram with a minor increase in luminosity without expanding, as the accretion timescale exceeds the thermal time scale by a larger factor. Mass loss through stellar winds leads to a minor drop in luminosity shortly after the accretion phase as the star enters the recovery phase. For $\rm \gtrsim 0.01~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ the companion star experiences a sudden increase in luminosity by about one order of magnitude, inflates, and cools. Under the accreted gas layer the star retains its structure and continues to eject radiation-driven wind during the recovery phase, namely the time it takes to regain equilibrium. Eventually, the accreted material mixes with the inner layers of the star, and the star continues to evolve as a more massive star.</description>

      <title>Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only measurements with symbolic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star inspirals detected as gravitational waves carry information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not radii, which are measured by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars. An expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be advantageous for the multi-messenger astronomy. Using pySR, a symbolic regression method trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input, an approximate symbolic expression for neutron-star radius as a function of mass and tidal deformability is obtained. The approximation is tested on piecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on various non-polytropic EOSs based on realistic theories of dense matter, achieving consistent agreement between the ground truth values and the approximation for a broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations, with average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the approximation is applied to GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal deformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius distributions.</description>

      <title>Polarization of light from fast rotating Wolf-Rayet stars: A Monte Carlo simulations compared to analytical formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are potential progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts, but observational verification is challenging. Spectral lines from their expanding stellar wind obscure accurate rotational velocity measurements. Intrinsic polarization from wind rotation may help determine rotational speeds, requiring precise wind models. Our study aims to investigate the intrinsic polarization due to the rotational distortion of WR winds considering multiple scattering of photons and compare it to a single-scattering model, where we use an analytical expression of the polarization. We study the polarization signatures resulting from the prolate structure of rotating winds of two WR stars using a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Hyperion. We estimated the intrinsic polarization resulting from multiple scattering in WR winds for different rotational velocities, inclination angles, and mass-loss rates. Our results indicate that at a rotation rate of less than 50 % of the critical rate, the intrinsic polarization from multiple scattering is close to that of a single scattering model. However, at higher rotation velocities, the polarization from multiple scattering increases with inclination up to 40$^\circ$, while it decreases for inclinations higher than about 60$^\circ$. This dependence is inconsistent with the single-scattering model. We also discuss the effect of the mass-loss rate on the polarization and find that the polarization changes linearly with the mass-loss rate. However, it is important to note that the relationship between polarization and mass-loss rate may vary for different types of stars. The results have implications for future studies of stellar winds and mass loss and may help to improve our understanding of the complex environments of massive stars. Our research offers valuable information on the complex polarization patterns observed in stellar winds.</description>

      <title>How Charged Can Neutrinos Be?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how neutrinos may acquire small electric charges within the Standard Model framework while preserving electromagnetic gauge invariance. Instead of gauging the standard hypercharge generator $Y$, a linear combination of $Y$ and a new generator $X$ from a gaugable global $U(1)_X$ symmetry is embedded, under which neutrinos transform non-trivially. We demonstrate that minimal scenarios based on flavor-dependent $U(1)_X$ symmetries, such as $X = L_\alpha - L_\beta$, are incompatible with current neutrino oscillation data. In contrast, we have shown that only flavor-universal $U(1)_X$ symmetries-such as $U(1)_{B-L}$, which shifts both quark and lepton charges, and $U(1)_L$, which modifies only the lepton sector-can generate tiny neutrino charges consistent with observed masses and mixing. We also discuss the necessary connection between such charges and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. By analyzing the phenomenological implications in detail, our findings emphasize that constraints on neutrino charges should be evaluated within the specific framework of the $U(1)_X$ symmetry under consideration, rather than assuming a generic approach, as is often the case.</description>

      <title>Accessing a New Population of Supermassive Black Holes with Extensions to the Event Horizon Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope has produced resolved images of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87*, which present the largest shadows on the sky. In the next decade, technological improvements and extensions to the array will enable access to a greater number of sources, unlocking studies of a larger population of supermassive black holes through direct imaging. In this paper, we identify 12 of the most promising sources beyond Sgr A* and M87* based on their angular size and millimeter flux density. For each of these sources, we make theoretical predictions for their observable properties by ray tracing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic models appropriately scaled to each target's mass, distance, and flux density. We predict that these sources would have somewhat higher Eddington ratios than M87*, which may result in larger optical and Faraday depths than previous EHT targets. Despite this, we find that visibility amplitude size constraints can plausibly recover masses within a factor of 2, although the unknown jet contribution remains a significant uncertainty. We find that the linearly polarized structure evolves substantially with Eddington ratio, with greater evolution at larger inclinations, complicating potential spin inferences for inclined sources. We discuss the importance of 345 GHz observations, milli-Jansky baseline sensitivity, and independent inclination constraints for future observations with upgrades to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) through ground updates with the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) program and extensions to space through the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Continuum Time Delay Variation Phenomenon in an Active Supermassive Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolving the accretion disks and broad line regions (BLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can probe the physics behind supermassive black holes (SMBHs) fueling and weigh SMBHs. With time-domain observations, the reverberation mapping (RM) technique measures time delays between different light curves, probing the AGN inner structures that are otherwise often too compact to resolve spatially with current facilities. Theoretically, the SMBH accretion disk structure does not evolve over decades. Here we report the significant variations in the continuum time delays of NGC 4151. In the high-flux state, our high-cadence ($\sim 2$ days) spectroscopy reveals that continuum time delays are $3.8^{+1.8}_{-1.0}$ times larger than those in the low-flux state and $14.9\pm 2.0$ times longer than the classical standard thin disk prediction. Notably, the continuum time delays can be comparable with the time delay between H$\beta$ and the $5100\ \mathrm{\AA}$ continuum, and the latter is commonly used to calculate the BLR sizes. Hence, the BLR sizes are underestimated if the continuum time delays are not considered, which introduces $\sim 0.3$ dex systematic uncertainties on RM SMBH masses. Our findings underscore that simultaneous continuum and BLR RMs are vital for better deciphering the SMBH accretion and mass function.</description>

      <title>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in a Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches ~200 EeV, such as the Amaterasu particle. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of ~1 ZeV ion within a timescale of ~1 ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of ~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim$10 PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</description>

      <title>Minute time scale variability in $\gamma$-ray flare of BL Lacertae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In October 2024, The object BL Lac experienced a brightest flaring event in gamma-ray ($&gt;$100 MeV) with a historical $\gamma$-ray flux of $\sim$10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Soon after the event was followed across the waveband and in X-ray (0.3-10 keV) it was also found to be flaring with the maximum flux achieved during this event as 8.30$\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The high gamma-ray significance enables us to probe the shortest time scale variability possible and for that, we produced the orbital binned light curve, 5 minutes binned light curve, and the 2 minutes binned light curve. A clear variation is seen in the 5-minute light curve and is fitted with the sum of exponentials to derive the rise and decay time scale which ranges between 3 to 12 minutes. The fastest variability time is also estimated to be an order of 1 minute from 2 minute. The estimated size of the emission region is very small (10$^{13}$ cm) compared to the size of the black hole event horizon. The location of the emission region is estimated to be very close to the supermassive black hole (10$^{14}$ cm) and much inside the BLR (0.1 pc). We discussed the possible way to explain this fast-flux variability in BL Lac.</description>

      <title>The GRBSN webtool: An open-source repository for gamma-ray burst-supernova associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the GRBSN webtool, an open-source data repository coupled to a web interface that hosts the most complete dataset of GRB-SN associations to date. In contrast to repositories of supernova (SN) or gamma-ray burst (GRB) data, this tool provides a multi-wavelength view of each GRB-SN association. GRBSN allows users to view and interact with plots of the data; search and filter the whole database; and download radio, X-ray, optical/NIR photometric and spectroscopic data related to a GRB-SN association. The web interface code and GRB-SN data are hosted on a public GitHub repository, allowing users to upload their own data, flag missing data and suggest improvements. The GRBSN webtool will be maintained by the Space Science group at University College Dublin, Ireland. As the number of confirmed GRB-SN associations increases in the coming years, the GRBSN webtool will provide a robust framework in which to catalogue these associations and their associated data. The web interface is available at: https://grbsn.watchertelescope.ie.</description>

      <title>Non-Newtonian corrections to radiative viscosity: Israel-Stewart theory as a viscosity limiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation is a universal friction-increasing agent. When two fluid layers are in relative motion, the inevitable exchange of radiation between such layers gives rise to an effective force, which tries to prevent the layers from sliding. This friction is often modeled as a Navier-Stokes shear viscosity. However, non-Newtonian corrections are expected to appear at distances of about one optical depth from the layers' interface. Such corrections prevent the viscous stress from becoming too large. Here, we set the foundations of a rigorous theory for these corrections, valid along incompressible flows. We show that, in the linear regime, the infinite Chapman-Enskog series can be computed analytically, leading to universal formulas for all transport coefficients, which apply to any fluid, with any composition, with radiation of any type (also neutrinos), and with nearly any type of radiative process. We then show that, with an appropriate shear-heat coupling coefficient, Israel-Stewart theory can correctly describe most non-Newtonian features of radiative shear stresses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sun can efficiently capture leptophilic dark matter that scatters with free electrons. If this dark matter subsequently annihilates into leptonic states, it can produce a detectable neutrino flux. Using 10 years of Super-Kamiokande observations, we set constraints on the dark-matter/electron scattering cross-section that exceed terrestrial direct detection searches by more than an order of magnitude for dark matter masses below 100 GeV, and reach cross-sections as low as $\sim$4$\times$10$^{-41}$cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Radiation Reaction effects on Coherent Emission in Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetized shocks are natural sources of coherent radiation, representing a promising framework for fast radio bursts (FRBs). This study explores how the radiation reaction (RR) effect, triggered by high-energy photon emissions during shock radiation, significantly alters particle dynamics and coherent radiation properties. Using kinetic particle simulations, we demonstrate that RR severely suppresses electron energies from shock acceleration, resulting in multiple coherent gyration cycles at the shock front. It amplifies the intensity of coherent radiation and boosts energy efficiency by several fold, as compared to the single gyration cycle in standard model of Relativistic magnetized shocks. We further find that the coherent radiation spectrum from RR-mediated shocks characterized by upshift peak frequency, broaden bandwidth, and peak spectral morphology. The results support the magnetized shock as a viable source of FRBs, by providing explanation for the bimodal energy distribution observed in repeating FRB 20121102A and the statistically positive correlation of luminosity and bandwidth between repeating and one-off FRBs in the CHIME/FRB catalog.</description>

      <title>Investigating the correlation between ZTF TDEs and IceCube high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main contributors of the IceCube diffuse neutrino flux remain unclear. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as potential emitters of the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube. Therefore, investigating the correlation between the TDE population and IceCube neutrinos could help us better understand whether the TDE population could be potential high-energy neutrino emitters. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for TDEs that are associated with neutrinos in a sample including 143 IceCube neutrino alert events and 56 TDEs classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) - Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, considering that the TDEs/TDE candidates reported as potential IceCube neutrino emitters are all accompanied by infrared (IR) observations, we further select the TDEs with IR observations from these 56 TDEs as a subsample to examine the correlation with neutrinos. Based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission database, eight TDEs are identified as having IR observations. Since good spatial localization is crucial for association analysis, we employ two methods to handle alert events with large error radii in our sample. Then we employ Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the correlation between the TDE sample/subsample and IceCube neutrinos. Finally, after considering spatial and temporal criteria, the eight TDEs with IR echoes show the most significant correlation at a 2.37$\sigma$ confidence level. If we tentatively further take the time delay factor into account in the weighting scheme, the correlation enhances to 2.65$\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Simulating the shaping of point-symmetric structures in the jittering jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of core-collapse supernovae by launching several pairs of jets into a collapsing core model and show that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) can form a point-symmetric morphology that accounts for observed morphologies of about a dozen core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) remnants. Point-symmetric morphologies are composed of pairs of opposite structures around the center of the CCSN remnant. In the JJEM, the newly born neutron star launches several to a few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions, and these jets explode the star. In the simulations with the FLASH numerical code, we launch pairs of jets with varying directions, energies, opening angles, and durations into the massive stellar core and follow their evolution for about two seconds. We show that the jets form pairs of opposite filaments, clumps, bubbles, and lobes, namely, prominent point-symmetric morphologies. The interaction of the jets with the core leads to vigorous Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and excites many vortices, which also shape clumps and filaments. Our results suggest that the JJEM could play a central role in the explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating can boost the role of jets.</description>

      <title>Scattering of stellar-mass black holes and gravitational wave bremsstrahlung radiation in AGN disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics of stellar mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could produce highly eccentric orbits near the central supermassive black hole, leading to repeated close encounters that emit gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band. Many works have focused on the mergers of sBH in the disk that produce gravitational waves; however, sBHs in hyperbolic orbits also emit gravitational-wave \bremss{} that can be detected by ground-based interferometers like LIGO. In this work, we analyze the scattering of sBHs in an AGN disk as they migrate inside the disk, focusing on gravitational-wave \bremss{} emission. We determine how the gravitational-wave emission depends on the different parameters of the scattering experiments, such as the mass of the supermassive black hole and the sBH migration rate and mass ratio. We find that scattering with detectable gravitational-wave \bremss{} is more frequent around lower mass SMBHs ($\sim 10^{5-6}$M$_\odot$). We then conduct a suite of Monte Carlo simulations and estimated the rate for ground-based gravitational-wave detections to be in the range of 0.08 - 1194 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$, depending on migration forces and detection thresholds, with large uncertainties accounting for variations in possible AGN environments. The expected rate for our {\tt Fiducial} parameters is 3.2 $\text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{ yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we provide first-principle gravitational wave templates produced by the encounters.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT discovers a jet-driven bow shock near GRS 1915+105. How an invisible large-scale jet sculpts a microquasar's environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes, both supermassive and stellar-mass, impact the evolution of their surroundings on a large range of scales. While the role of supermassive black holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their surroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), remain under explored.
  This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for its active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact of GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM interaction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total exposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to date. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we inferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into the jet-ISM interaction site.
  Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely induced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity in the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\,cm$^{-3}$ while assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\,K, which implies a bow shock expansion velocity of $20\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}&lt;\dot{L} &lt;\,360\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow shock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate Conclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy dissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through the interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the environment.
  This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black holes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's activity has in shaping its surroundings.</description>

Abstract: In this document we consider the problem of finding the optimal layout for the array of water Cherenkov detectors proposed by the SWGO collaboration to study very-high-energy gamma rays in the southern hemisphere. We develop a continuous model of the secondary particles produced by atmospheric showers initiated by high-energy gamma rays and protons, and build an optimization pipeline capable of identifying the most promising configuration of the detector elements. The pipeline employs stochastic gradient descent to maximize a utility function aligned with the scientific goals of the experiment. We demonstrate how the software is capable of finding the global maximum in the high-dimensional parameter space, and discuss its performance and limitations.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Subtleties in the Scaling of the 'Terminal Momentum' For Galaxy Formation Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In galaxy formation simulations, it is increasingly common to represent supernovae (SNe) at finite resolution (when the Sedov-Taylor phase is unresolved) via hybrid energy-momentum coupling with some 'terminal momentum' $p_{\rm term}$ (depending weakly on ambient density and metallicity) that represents unresolved work from an energy-conserving phase. Numerical implementations can ensure momentum and energy conservation of such methods, but these require that couplings depend on the surrounding gas velocity field (radial velocity $\langle v_{r} \rangle$). This raises the question of whether $p_{\rm term}$ should also be velocity-dependent, which we explore analytically and in simulations. We show that for simple spherical models, the dependence of $p_{\rm term}$ on $\langle v_{r} \rangle$ introduces negligible corrections beyond those already imposed by energy conservation if $\langle v_{r} \rangle \ge 0$. However, for SNe in some net converging flow ($\langle v_{r} \rangle&lt;0$), naively coupling the total momentum when a blastwave reaches the standard cooling/snowplow phase (or some effective cooling time/velocity/temperature criterion) leads to enormous $p_{\rm term}$ and potentially pathological behaviors. We propose an alternative $\Delta$-Momentum formulation which represents the differential SNe effect and show this leads to opposite behavior of $p_{\rm term}$ in this limit. We also consider a more conservative velocity-independent formulation. Testing in numerical simulations, these directly translate to large effects on predicted star formation histories and stellar masses of massive galaxies, explaining differences between some models and motivating further study in idealized simulations.</description>

      <title>An Extended Closure Relation by LightGBM for Neutrino Radiation Transport in Core-collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a machine learning model using LightGBM, one of the most popular gradient-boosting decision tree methods these days, to predict the Eddington tensor, or the second-order angular moment, for neutrino radiation transport in core-collapse supernova simulations. We use not only the zeroth and first moments of the neutrino distribution function in momentum space as in ordinary closure relations but also information on the background matter configuration extensively. For training the model, we utilize some post-bounce snapshots from one of our previous Boltzmann radiation-hydrodynamics simulations; the Eddington tensor as well as the zeroth and first angular moments are calculated from the neutrino distribution function obtained in the simulation. LightGBM is light indeed, and its high efficiency in training enables us to feed a large number of features and figure out which features are more important than others. In this paper, we report the results of this feature engineering in addition to those of the training, validation, and generalization of our model. We find that the flux factor and non-local features are among the most relevant features; our LightGBM model can reproduce the Eddington factor better in general than the M1 closure relation, one of the most commonly employed algebraic closure relations at present; the generalization performance is also much improved from our previous model based on the deep neural network.</description>

      <title>A Tetrad-First Approach to Robust Numerical Algorithms in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativistic Riemann solvers are typically complex, fragile and unwieldy, at least in comparison to their special relativistic counterparts. In this paper, we present a new high-resolution shock-capturing algorithm on curved spacetimes that employs a local coordinate transformation at each inter-cell boundary, transforming all primitive and conservative variables into a locally flat spacetime coordinate basis (i.e., the tetrad basis), generalizing previous approaches developed for relativistic hydrodynamics. This algorithm enables one to employ a purely special relativistic Riemann solver, combined with an appropriate post-hoc flux correction step, irrespective of the geometry of the underlying Lorentzian manifold. We perform a systematic validation of the algorithm using the Gkeyll simulation framework for both general relativistic electromagnetism and general relativistic hydrodynamics, highlighting the algorithm's superior convergence and stability properties in each case when compared against standard analytical solutions for black hole magnetosphere and ultra-relativistic black hole accretion problems. However, as an illustration of the generality and practicality of the algorithm, we also apply it to more astrophysically realistic magnetosphere and fluid accretion problems in the limit of high black hole spin, for which standard general relativistic Riemann solvers are often too unstable to produce useful solutions.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We investigate the significance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. Specifically, we develop relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms including two different environmental effects in the EMRI waveforms: power-law migration torques, and superradiance scalar clouds. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms incorrectly estimate the predicted source's horizon redshift by approximately $35\%$ error. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameter estimates (error $\simeq 8\%$), representing a significant improvement over previous estimates. Additionally, we assess the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk biases the parameter estimation (PE), reporting a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. In a fully relativistic setup, we also estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with relative errors $\simeq 0.3\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects is essential for LISA science objectives with EMRIs.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a series of 769 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx32\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter with future MeV gamma-ray telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of new balloon or space-based $\gamma$-ray observatories have been proposed to close a "MeV gap" in sensitivity to $\gamma$ rays in the MeV-GeV energy band. One aspect of the science case for these instruments is their ability to constrain or discover decaying or annihilating dark matter. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of these instruments for dark matter annihilation or decay for a range of possible Standard Model final states and compare to existing bounds.</description>

      <title>Detection of Anisotropies in the Circumgalactic Medium of Disk Galaxies: Supermassive Black Hole Activity or Star Formation-driven Outflows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma and X-ray observatories have revealed spectacular structures in the emission of the tenuous hot gas surrounding the Milky Way (MW), known as the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. Galaxy formation simulations suggest that MW-like bubbles could be ubiquitous, but their emission may be too faint to detect with today's instruments in individual external galaxies. In this paper, we present an analysis of stacked Chandra observations of 93 nearby galaxies. We detected soft, diffuse X-rays from the CGM, extending up to 14 kpc, with a luminosity of $(4.2\pm0.7)\times10^{39}$ erg/s in the $0.3-2$ keV band. To probe its spatial distribution, we constructed an azimuthal profile and found a significant enhancement along the galactic minor axis. When dividing our sample by stellar mass, central supermassive black hole mass, and star formation rate, we found that only high star formation rate galaxies exhibit significant anisotropies in the CGM emission. To investigate whether the observed anisotropies could be attributed to MW-like bubbles, we compared our results with TNG50 simulations. In these simulations, X-ray bubbles are strongly correlated with mass of the central supermassive black hole and typically extend to much larger, $\sim50$ kpc, scales. We conclude that the observed anisotropies are either caused by AGN-driven MW-like bubbles confined to smaller, $\sim10$ kpc, scales, or by star formation- or starburst-driven bubbles/outflows.</description>

      <title>Zooming In On The Multi-Phase Structure of Magnetically-Dominated Quasar Disks: Radiation From Torus to ISCO Across Accretion Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent radiation-thermochemical-magnetohydrodynamic simulations resolved formation of quasar accretion disks from cosmological scales down to ~300 gravitational radii $R_{g}$, arguing they were 'hyper-magnetized' (plasma $\beta\ll1$ supported by toroidal magnetic fields) and distinct from traditional $\alpha$-disks. We extend these, refining to $\approx 3\,R_{g}$ around a $10^{7}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ BH with multi-channel radiation and thermochemistry, and exploring a factor of 1000 range of accretion rates ($\dot{m}\sim0.01-20$). At smaller scales, we see the disks maintain steady accretion, thermalize and self-ionize, and radiation pressure grows in importance, but large deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and single-phase equations of state are always present. Trans-Alfvenic and highly-supersonic turbulence persists in all cases, and leads to efficient vertical mixing, so radiation pressure saturates at levels comparable to fluctuating magnetic and turbulent pressures even for $\dot{m}\gg1$. The disks also become radiatively inefficient in the inner regions at high $\dot{m}$. The midplane magnetic field remains primarily toroidal at large radii, but at super-Eddington $\dot{m}$ we see occasional transitions to a poloidal-field dominated state associated with outflows and flares. Large-scale magnetocentrifugal and continuum radiation-pressure-driven outflows are weak at $\dot{m}&lt;1$, but can be strong at $\dot{m}\gtrsim1$. In all cases there is a scattering photosphere above the disk extending to $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{g}$ at large $\dot{m}$, and the disk is thick and flared owing to magnetic support (with $H/R$ nearly independent of $\dot{m}$), so the outer disk is strongly illuminated by the inner disk and most of the inner disk continuum scatters or is reprocessed at larger scales, giving apparent emission region sizes as large as $\gtrsim 10^{16}\,{\rm cm}$.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive UV and Optical spectral analysis of Cygnus X-1: Stellar and wind parameters, abundances, and evolutionary implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of Cyg X-1, utilizing archival high-resolution UV and optical spectra in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric models. Notably, this is the first investigation to simultaneously analyze UV and optical spectra of Cyg X-1 along with incorporating X-rays to constrain the stellar and wind parameters. Our analysis yields notably lower masses for both the donor (29$\,M_\odot$) and the black hole (12.7 to 17.8$\,M_\odot$, depending on inclination), and confirms that the donor's radius is close to reaching the inner Lagrangian point. We find super-solar Fe, Si, and Mg abundances (1.3-1.8 times solar) at the surface of the donor star, while the total CNO abundance remains solar despite evidence of CNO processing (N enrichment, O depletion) and He enrichment. This abundance pattern is distinct from the surrounding Cyg OB3 association. We observe a clear difference in wind parameters between X-ray states: $v_\infty \approx 1200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M} \approx 3\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the high/soft state, increasing to $v_\infty\lesssim 1800\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the low/hard state. The observed X-ray luminosity is consistent with wind-fed accretion. Evolutionary models show that Cyg X-1 will undergo Roche lobe overflow in the near future. Under a fully conservative mass accretion scenario, our models predict a future binary black hole merger for Cyg X-1 within $\sim5$ Gyr. Our comprehensive analysis provides refined stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in Cyg X-1, highlighting the importance of using advanced atmospheric models and considering X-ray ionization and wind clumping. The observed abundances suggest a complex formation history involving a high initial metallicity.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C II] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C II] shells in Galactic H II regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H II regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C II] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and find a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C II]-deficit found in Galactic H II bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variable Candidates Identified in eROSITA-DE DR1,XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a low-mass star, making them significant sources of X-ray emission in the Galaxy. We present a systematic search for X-ray emitting CV candidates by cross-matching four X-ray catalogs (eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT) with Gaia sources located in the bridge region between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. From 444 candidates (267 confirmed CVs and 177 new candidates), we detect orbital modulation in 56 sources using ZTF/TESS light curves. The eROSITA catalog contributes 51% of candidates, outperforming other surveys due to its wider sky coverage and higher sensitivity (~10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}). Our method demonstrates the efficiency of combining X-ray data with time-domain analysis for CV identification, with future eROSITA observations expected to expand the population of X-ray emitting CVs.</description>
