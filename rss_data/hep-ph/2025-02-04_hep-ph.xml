      <title>Probing Light Particles With Optically Trapped Sensors Through Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically levitated nanospheres are highly sensitive to the motion of their center of mass even under small momentum transfer. We propose detecting exotic particles via nucleon scattering in such spheres in the context of an ongoing experiment. The 200 nm-diameter spheres within the present experimental realization, featuring a configuration of the array $4\times 4$ and its upgrade, can achieve sensitivity to nuclear couplings of ALPs exclusively and pseudoscalar dark matter in the $\sim 10$ keV mass range, targeting previously unconstrained regions of parameter space. In contrast, a smaller sphere with a diameter of 15 nm benefits from overall coherence enhancement, enabling the detection of pseudoscalar and vector dark matter down to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ eV even with a single sphere. This smaller setup also offers the potential for the direct detection of Earth-bound dark matter strongly coupled with visible matter, even with its minimal velocity and tiny fractional abundance.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-loop amplitudes for $q\bar{q}\to \gamma \gamma$ and $gg \to \gamma \gamma$ mediated by a heavy-quark loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the analytic computation of the two-loop scattering amplitudes for the production of two photons in parton-parton scattering, mediated by loops of heavy quarks. Due to the presence of integrals of elliptic type, both partonic channels have been previously computed using semi-numerical methods. In this paper, leveraging new advances in the theory of differential equations for elliptic Feynman integrals, we derive a canonical basis for all integrals involved and compute them in terms of independent iterated integrals over elliptic and polylogarithmic differential forms. We use this representation to showcase interesting cancellations in the physical expressions for the scattering amplitudes. Furthermore, we address their numerical evaluation by producing series expansion representations for the whole amplitudes, which we demonstrate to be fast and numerically reliable across a large region of the phase space.</description>

      <title>Electroweak baryogenesis from charged current anomalies in $B$ meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate for the first time that new physics explaining the long standing charged $B$ meson anomalies, $R(D^{(*)})$, can be the source of CP violation that explains the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). We consider the general two Higgs doublet model with complex Yukawa couplings and compute the BAU in the semiclassical formalism, using a novel analytic approximation for the latter. After imposing constraints from both flavor observables and the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), we find that a significant BAU can still be generated for a variety of benchmark points in the parameter space, assuming the occurrence of a sufficiently strong first order electroweak phase transition. These scenarios, which explain both the $R(D^{(*)})$ flavor anomalies and the BAU, can be probed with future eEDM experiments and Higgs factories measurements.</description>

      <title>Local form factor subtraction for three-loop QCD corrections to electroweak production in quark-antiquark annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a local subtraction framework to three-loop QCD corrections for the production of multiple electroweak bosons in quark-antiquark annihilation. We derive two-loop Ward identities that ensure the factorisation of most collinear singularities from the hard-scattering process in the sum over integrands. Infrared and ultraviolet singularities are removed point-by-point in loop momentum space using a minimal set of counterterms, which can be integrated analytically in terms of known master integrals. Additional counterterms eliminate non-factorising terms arising from loop momentum shifts and one-loop corrections to the gluon three-point function. We identify previously unknown non-factorising loop polarisation effects in the single-collinear regions, which pose challenges for local integrability and require further investigation. The techniques presented here are a first crucial step in formulating a systematic approach for constructing finite integrands for general electroweak amplitudes at three-loop order.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation with T-Model Kahler Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel implementations of Starobisky-like inflation within Supergravity adopting Kahler potentials for the inflaton which parameterize hyperbolic geometries known from the T-model inflation. The associated superpotentials are consistent with an R and a global or gauge U(1)_X symmetries. The inflaton is represented by a gauge singlet or non-singlet superfield and is accompanied by a gauge-singlet superfield successfully stabilized thanks to its compact contribution into the total Kahler potential. Keeping the Kahler manifold intact, a conveniently violated shift symmetry is introduced which allows for a slight variation of the predictions of Starobinsky inflation: The (scalar) spectral index exhibits an upper bound which lies close to its central observational value whereas the constant scalar curvature of the inflaton-sector Kahler manifold increases with the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Charge sum rules for quark fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge sum rules for quark fragmentation functions are studied. The simultaneous implementation of the conservation of electric and baryon charges, strangeness and isospin symmetry is achieved when the fragmentation to both mesons and baryons is considered. The results are compatible to Gell-Mann--Nishijima formulas and may be the new manifestation of superconformal symmetry between mesons and baryons. The numerical estimates are performed and compared with phenomenological models. The recently suggested violations of sum rules due to Wilson lines contributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating pseudovectors in effective field theories for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories which describe the coupling between gravity and matter fields have recently been extended to include terms with operators of non-minimal mass dimension. These terms preserve the usual gauge symmetries but may violate local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. The number of possible terms in the field theory explodes once one allows for non-minimal operators, with no criterion to choose between them. We suggest as such a criterion to focus on terms which violate Lorentz invariance via a (pseudo)vector background field, leaving a number of possible terms in the Higgs, gauge and gravitational sectors. Further study of these terms is motivated by the proposed correspondence between the general effective theory for Lorentz violation and emergent Lorentz symmetry in condensed-matter systems, which is mostly unexplored for higher mass dimension operators and couplings to gauge fields and gravity. We suggest bounds in the Higgs sector and we show that some of the coefficients in the gauge sector vanish at one loop, whereas others have bounds which are comparable with those suggested by Kosteleck\'y and Li for coefficients in Lorentz-violating QCD and QED coupled to quarks. We also find new bounds in the gravitational sector by considering Robertson-Walker cosmology. Finally, we discuss the special case where only diffeomorphism invariance is spontaneously broken and explain why it does not allow for non-trivial Nambu-Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Background-field method and QCD factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One method for deriving a factorization for QCD processes is to use successive integration over fields in the functional integral. In this approach, we separate the fields into two categories: dynamical fields with momenta above a relevant cutoff, and background fields with momenta below the cutoff. The dynamical fields are then integrated out in the background of the low-momentum background fields. This strategy works well at tree level, allowing us to quickly derive QCD factorization formulas at leading order. However, to extend the approach to higher loops, it is necessary to rigorously define the functional integral over dynamical fields in an arbitrary background field. This framework was carefully developed for the calculation of the effective action in a background field at the two-loop level in the classic paper by Abbott [1]. Building on this work, I specify the renormalized background-field Lagrangian and define the notion of the quantum average of an operator in a background field, consistent with the ``separation of scales'' scheme mentioned earlier. As examples, I discuss the evolution of the twist-2 gluon light-ray operator and the one-loop gluon propagator in a background field near the light cone.</description>

      <title>Investigating Notions of Entropy and Its Production in High Energy Particle Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes different notions of entropy and its production in $ep$ and heavy-ion collisions, focusing on the early stages of the collision. To this end, the importance of phenomena such as quantum entanglement and decoherence in entropy generation was studied. Using state-of-the-art methods for calculating entanglement entropy in the high-energy limit and synthesizing various approaches for its computation, phenomenological results were obtained from analytical expressions for the number of gluons. Results were also presented for the entanglement entropy in two-body elastic scattering based on the hadronic structure given by the model-independent L\'evy method, at energy values typical of the RHIC, Tevatron, and LHC. Phenomenological models of unintegrated gluon distributions were used to calculate dynamic entropy in the QCD of dense gluonic states in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions at high energies, comparing it with decoherence entropy. The obtained results were contrasted with other notions of entropy in the literature, and theoretical uncertainties were discussed.</description>

      <title>Study of the mass spectra of doubly heavy $\Xi_{QQ}$ and $\Omega_{QQ}$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we enumerated the mass spectra of the radial and orbital excited states for the doubly heavy $\Xi_{QQ}$ and $\Omega_{QQ}$ baryons using the Regge trajectory model and the scaling rules. Recently, LHCb Collaboration first observed a doubly charmed baryon $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ in the $\Lambda^{+}_{c}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ decay with a mass of $3621.40\pm0.78$ MeV. Our studies show that $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ can be grouped into the $1S$-wave state with the spin-parity quantum number $J^{P} = 1/2^{-}$. On the other hand, the mass of $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ with $J^{P} = 3/2^{-}$ is predicted to be $3699.69$ MeV. We also predict the mass spectra of the unknown ground and excited states for the doubly heavy baryons, which provide useful references for the experimental test in the future.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Chiral Magnetic Effect in the heavy-ion collisions using AVFD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework is utilized to generate $^{197}_{79}Au+^{197}_{79}Au$, $^{96}_{44}Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$, and $^{96}_{40}Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$ collision events at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV, aiming to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The CME signal is modulated through the axial charge per entropy density ($n_5/s$), varied as 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2 to produce distinct data sets with varying CME signal strengths. Additionally, a 33$\%$ local charge conservation (LCC) is implemented in each event. These data sets are analyzed using CME-sensitive two- and three-particle correlators. Furthermore, the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) is employed to identify potential CME-like events within each data set. The identified events exhibit characteristics consistent with CME. The CME fraction in these events is quantified while accounting for backgrounds derived from charge shuffle events and correlated background contributions. No enhancement in the CME signal is observed in $Ru+Ru$ collisions compared to $Zr+Zr$ collisions, despite the presence of four additional protons in $^{96}_{44}Ru$ nuclei compared to $^{96}_{40}Zr$ nuclei.</description>

      <title>A model calculation of the CKM matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a strategy to compute the CKM matrix based on the conjecture, recently put forward in the literature, according to which elementary particle masses are not generated like in the standard Higgs scenario, but emerge from a non-perturbative mechanism triggered by the presence in the fundamental Lagrangian of ``irrelevant'' chiral breaking operators of the Wilson type of dimension $d\geq 6$ scaled by $d-4$ powers of the UV cutoff. Non-perturbatively generated quark masses have the form $m_q\sim C_q(\alpha) \Lambda_{RGI}$ where $\Lambda_{RGI}$ is the RGI scale of the theory and $C_q(\alpha)$ is a function of the gauge couplings. For the (elementary) fermion $q$ the $C_q(\alpha)$ leading behaviour is $C_q(\alpha)={\mbox{O}}(\alpha^{1+(d_q-4)/2})$. The dependence of the gauge coupling power behaviour from the dimension $d_q$ of the Wilson-like operators associated with the fermion $q$ can be exploited to construct hierarchically organized up and down ''proto-mass matrices'' for ''proto-flavours'', the diagonalization of which yields flavoured quarks with definite masses and a first principle construction of the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>The Aharonov-Bohm effect for a constant scalar matter potential in neutrino flavour interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is one of the most surprising wonders of the quantum world. The observed solenoid effect, as well as others, shows that a particle is affected by the potential in a region in which there is no force-field. This is so through the phase of the probability amplitude. Its interpretation is debated between a physical significance of the potential versus non-locality of quantum physics with the presence of the force-field generated by the potential difference outside this region. We demonstrate that the debate is resolved with the idea of replacing spatial interference by flavour interferometry as observed in neutrino oscillations. The neutrino propagation through the crust of the Earth in current facilities is affected by a constant scalar matter potential and the phase difference is in flavour internal properties. Here we show how to signal and experimentally disentangle the phase-shift due to the potential by means of observables characteristic of its symmetry properties. The energy dependence of the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the golden transition $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ allows a clear separation of the matter component against the genuine asymmetry in the absence of the potential. These findings define, in a perfect symbiosis between quantum physics and particle physics, the path to observe in a single experiment the physical significance of the potential, the neutrino mass hierarchy and the genuine matter-antimatter asymmetry in the lepton sector.</description>

      <title>Thrust distribution in electron-positron annihilation at full NNNLL+NNLO (and beyond) in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the thrust ($T$) distribution in electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) annihilation and we perform the all-order resummation of the large logarithms of $1-T$ up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^4$LL) accuracy in QCD. We consistently combine resummed predictions with the known fixed-order results up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). All perturbative terms up to order $\alpha_S^3$ are included in our calculation which, thanks to a unitarity constraint, exactly reproduce after integration over the variable $T$ the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) result for the total cross section of $e^+e^-$ into hadrons. We resum the large logarithms in the Laplace-conjugated space and compare our results with those obtained with the analytic resummation formalism in the physical ($T$) space. We find that the differences in the spectra obtained with the two different formalisms are sizable. Non-perturbative corrections have been included through an analytic hadronization model depending on two free parameters. Finally, we present a comparison of our spectra with experimental data at the $Z$-boson mass ($m_Z$) energy, which enables us to extract the value of the QCD coupling $\alpha_S(m_Z^2)=0.1181 \pm 0.0018$ fully consistent with the world average.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Physics from Asymptotic Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dilaton is investigated from first principles in an asymptotically free Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory in three dimensions. In the limit of many fermion flavours, the theory features a finite line of strongly interacting fixed points with continuous quantum phase transitions and a massless Goldstone boson, the dilaton, following spontaneous scale symmetry breaking at its endpoint. Interestingly, we find that the emergence of a vacuum expectation value and a dilaton can be understood as a double-scaling limit. Exploiting the scalar two-point function, we identify the dilaton in the spectrum, compute its decay constant, and obtain universal expressions for the induced dilaton mass in terms of small perturbations. Consistency of findings with soft dilaton theorems is equally established. Implications for spontaneously broken conformal theories are indicated.</description>

      <title>Transverse force distributions in the proton from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry provides information about the transverse momentum of the struck quark and can be related to final-state interactions. Understanding these asymmetries at the quark level has been the subject of much interest in QCD phenomenology. In this contribution, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the transverse spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. Our lattice calculations employ $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavours of dynamical fermions at the SU(3) symmetric point across three lattice spacings. We determine a central, spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces larger than the QCD string tension. These distributions offer a new, complimentary picture that underlies the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Reheating chiral dynamos with spin-0 and massive spin-1 torsions via chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Effect of a repulsive three-body interaction on the $DD^{(*)}K$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadronic molecular picture of the observed exotic states has inspired numerous investigations into few-body systems. Recently, the lattice effective field theory studied the effect of a three-body interaction on the binding energy of the $DD^{*}K$ system, revealing an intriguing phenomenon in the binding energy. This work uses the Gaussian expansion method to explore the underlying physics. Our results show that as the repulsive three-body interaction strengthens, the spatial size of the $DD^{(*)}K$ bound state gradually increases. Further enhancement of the three-body interaction causes the $DD^{(*)}K$ three-body bound state to break into a $D^{(*)}K$ two-body bound state, accompanied by a distant $D$ meson. The identical nature of the two $D$ mesons leads to the fact that the $DDK$ system consistently resembles an isosceles triangle-shaped spatial configuration.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Problem of Multiple Control Parameters in Optimized Borel-Type Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most often used methods of summing divergent series in physics is the Borel-type summation with control parameters improving convergence, which are defined by some optimization conditions. The well known annoying problem in this procedure is the occurrence of multiple solutions for control parameters. We suggest a method for resolving this problem, based on the minimization of cost functional. Control parameters can be introduced by employing the Borel-Leroy or Mittag-Leffler transforms. Also, two novel transformations are proposed using fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. New cost functionals are advanced, based on lasso and ridge selection criteria, and their performance is studied for a number of models. The developed method is shown to provide good accuracy for the calculated quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary results on the susceptibilities involving the CP-violating (CPV) Weinberg three-gluon operator and the topological $\Theta$ term using the gradient flow scheme, and study their continuum and chiral extrapolations. These are used to provide an estimate of the $\Theta$ induced by the Weinberg operator in theories with the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism. Combined with the calculations of the matrix elements (MEs) of quark-bilinears between nucleon states, such calculations will enable estimates of the electric dipole moments (EDMs) and CPV pion-nucleon couplings due to the Weinberg operator, thereby providing robust constraints on beyond the standard model (BSM) physics.</description>

      <title>Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi|^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several standard features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the VQCD model, a holographic approach that dynamically simulates essential QCD characteristics, including linear mass spectra, confinement, asymptotic freedom, and magnetic charge screening, while incorporating quark flavor effects. Using this model, we first calculate the proton mass spectrum and the wave function, incorporating anomalous dimensions to refine our results. Next, we compute the proton structure functions across a range of Bjorken $x$ values using consistent parameters. Furthermore, we derive the proton electromagnetic form factor by solving the electromagnetic field's motion equation, accounting for background effects, and demonstrate qualitative consistency with results from free electromagnetic fields coupled to fermions. Finally, we calculate the gravitational form factors by introducing an effective graviton mass $m$ arising from chiral symmetry breaking and the proton energy-momentum tensor. Our calculations yield results that are in excellent agreement with experimental data and lattice QCD computations, validating the VQCD model as a robust tool for studying proton properties.</description>

      <title>Kaon Modification in Pion Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaon properties in pion medium are studied. The dense pion medium is produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The consideration is based on the chiral nucleon-kaon-pion Lagrangian. It is found that the pion medium does not produce a substantive contribution but enhances the effect of the baryon matter. Numerical estimate shows that this enhancement factor induced by the pion medium does not exceed 11\% at the freeze-out stage of heavy-ion collisions, i.e. it is small. However, the impact of this enhancement can be higher in actual nuclear collisions because the effect of the in-medium (anti)kaon modification is accumulated during the (anti)kaon evolution before the freeze-out when the pion density is higher.</description>

      <title>Can Q-balls describe cosmological and galactic dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) hypothesis accurately predicts large-scale structure formation and fits the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature fluctuations (CMB). However, observations of the inner regions of dark matter halos and dwarf galaxy satellites have consistently posed challenges to CDM. On the other hand, the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) hypothesis can explain galactic phenomena but fails to account for the complex shape of the CMB and matter power spectra. CDM and MOND are effective in nearly mutually exclusive regimes, prompting the question: Is there a physical mechanism where CDM and MOND share a common origin? Q-balls, which are localized, non-topological solitons, can be a bridge between the two hypotheses. Q-balls formed in the early Universe can mimic CDM at cosmological scales. Interestingly, Q-balls can exhibit MOND-like behavior in the late Universe at galactic scales, providing a unified framework. Specifically, we demonstrate that millicharged composite Q-balls formed from complex scalar fields, decoupled from the background radiation, can naturally arise during the radiation-dominated epoch. From the matter-radiation equality, we also obtain the mass of Q-balls to be $1~{eV}$, which are much smaller than the electron mass. Using the constraints from the invisible decay mode of ortho-positronium, we obtain $Q &lt; 3.4 \times 10^{-5}$. We also establish an upper bound on the number density of Q-balls, which depends on the charge of the Q-ball and the small initial charge asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MOND naturally emerges at the galactic scale within the framework of our Q-ball model.</description>

Abstract: In strongly deformed planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, or fishnet theory, a correlation function of four dimension-$m$ protected operators is given by a single Feynman integral, which involves integrating over locations of a $m\times m$ grid of points. We show that for any integer $m$ this square fishnet graph is invariant under the combined action of a kinematic map and the antipode map of the Hopf algebra on multiple polylogarithms, i.e. it possesses an antipodal self-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we computed the equation of state of dense QCD in the presence of background magnetic fields using lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential. Our simulations include 2+1+1 flavors of stout-smeared staggered fermions with masses at the physical point and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. Using several expansion schemes, we tuned our simulation parameters such that the equation of state satisfies strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints, which are relevant to the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions. Our results suggest a strong change in the equation of state due to the magnetic field, in particular, around the crossover temperature. A continuum extrapolation of our data is still needed for future applications of our equation of state to heavy-ion-collision phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: In this proceedings article, we present the first steps towards the determination of the out-of-equilibrium conductivity of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in the presence of strong interactions. Using linear response theory, we obtain an analytical expression for the spectral function associated with this effect at one-loop in perturbation theory. In addition, we provide a first estimate of the CME conductivity by calculating the associated Euclidean correlator using quenched Wilson fermions and dynamical staggered fermions in physical Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations. In particular, we focus on the midpoint of the correlator, which can be used as a proxy of the full conductivity. We present results in a wide range of temperatures, showing how this observable is suppressed at low temperatures, while at high temperatures it approaches the perturbation theory prediction.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group approach to the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity: Amplification of the pairing gap from $\ell^4$ to $\ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\ell \neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have claimed that the strong $CP$ problem does not occur in QCD, proposing a new order of limits in volume and topological sectors when studying observables on the lattice. We study the effect of the topological term on a simple quantum mechanical rotor that allows a lattice description. We particularly focus on recent proposals to face the challenging problems that this study poses in lattice QCD and that are also present in the quantum rotor, such as topology freezing and the sign problem.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple instanton-based random matrix model of hot QCD that in the quenched case precisely reproduces the distribution of the lowest lattice overlap Dirac eigenvalues. Even after including dynamical quarks the model can be easily simulated in volumes and for quark masses that will be out of reach for direct lattice simulations in the foreseeable future. Our simulations show that quantities connected to the $U(1)_A$ and $SU(N_f)_A$ chiral symmetry are dominated by eigenvalues in a peak of the spectral density that becomes singular at zero in the thermodynamic limit. This spectral peak turns out to be produced by an ideal instanton gas. By generalizing Banks-Casher type integrals for the singular spectral density, definite predictions can be given for physical quantities that are essential to test chiral symmetry breaking, but presently impossible to compute reliably with direct lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling in (2+1+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$ can be obtained from the static energy as shown in previous lattices studies. For short distances, the static energy can be calculated both on the lattice with the use of Wilson line correlators, and with the perturbation theory up to three loop accuracy with leading ultrasoft log resummation. Comparing the perturbative expression and lattice data allows for precise determination of $\alpha_\mathrm{s}(m_Z)$. We will present preliminary results for the determination of $\alpha_\mathrm{s} {(M_Z)}$ in (2+1+1)-flavor QCD using the configurations made availableby the MILC-collaboration with smallest lattice spacing reaching 0.0321fm.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes play a prominent role in relaxation of diverse physical systems to equilibria, ranging from astrophysical black holes to tiny droplets of quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC accelerators. We propose that a novel kind of quasinormal modes govern the direct approach to self-similar time evolution of nonthermal fixed points, whose relevance ranges from high energy physics to cold atom gases. We utilize black hole perturbation theory techniques to compute the spectrum of these far from equilibrium quasinormal modes for a kinetic theory with a Focker-Planck collision kernel in isotropic and homogeneous states. Our conclusion is that quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points give rise to a tower of progressively more decaying power-law contributions. A byproduct of our analysis is a precise determination and improved understanding of the distribution function characterizing nonthermal fixed points.</description>

      <title>Neutron structure function via a maximum entropy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.01387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the maximum entropy method to extract the valence quark distributions of the neutron at a low scale, \( Q_0^2 \).
  At this initial scale, the neutron is defined to contain only three valence quarks, with no contributions from sea quarks or gluons.
  The distributions of these initial valence quarks are constrained by principles from quark models, quark-hadron duality, and quark confinement.
  Employing the DGLAP equations supplemented by parton-parton recombination corrections, we derive the neutron structure function \( F_2^{\rm n} \) at higher scales \( Q^2 \).
  The resulting ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions, \( F_2^{\rm n}/F_{2}^{\rm p} \), aligns well with world data from deep inelastic scattering (DIS) on proton and deuteron targets,
  particularly when accounting for uncertainties from model-dependent corrections. Notably, this ratio is in agreement with the JLab MARATHON dataset, especially as \( x \) approaches 1.
  Additionally, our findings for \( F_2^{\rm n}/F_{2}^{\rm p} \) correspond well with the JLab BONuS experimental results after considering the impact of nucleon resonance contamination
  in the region \( x \gtrsim 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 \). We further compare our predictions for \( F_2^{\rm n}/F_{2}^{\rm p} \) and the \( u/d \) ratios in the limit as \( x \rightarrow 1 \) with
  existing theoretical calculations. Finally, we observe a minor violation of isospin symmetry between the proton and neutron, evidenced by the differences in valence quark distributions
  and the first-order moments of these distributions.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of the leading non-renormalizable terms in the effective field theory that describes general extensions of the Standard Model with vector-like quarks. Dropping the usual assumption of renormalizability has several phenomenological consequences for the production and decay of the heavy quarks and also for Higgs physics. The most dramatic effects, including those associated with a long lifetime, occur for vector-like quarks with non-standard quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>A complete effective field theory for dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory describing the relevant interactions of the Standard Model with an electrically neutral particle that can account for the dark matter in the Universe. The possible mediators of these interactions are assumed to be heavy. The dark matter candidates that we consider have spin 0, 1/2 or 1, belong to an electroweak multiplet with arbitrary isospin and hypercharge and their stability at cosmological scales is guaranteed by imposing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We present the most general framework for describing the interaction of the dark matter with standard particles, and construct a general non-redundant basis of the gauge-invariant operators up to dimension six. The basis includes multiplets with non-vanishing hypercharge, which can also be viable DM candidates. We give two examples illustrating the phenomenological use of such a general effective framework. First, we consider the case of a scalar singlet, provide convenient semi-analytical expressions for the relevant dark matter observables, use present experimental data to set constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the operators, and show how the interplay of different operators can open new allowed windows in the parameter space of the model. Then we study the case of a lepton isodoublet, which involves co-annihilation processes, and we discuss the impact of the operators on the particle mass splitting and direct detection cross sections. These examples highlight the importance of the contribution of the various non-renormalizable operators, which can even dominate over the gauge interactions in certain cases.</description>

Abstract: We study a Zee model applying a modular $A_4$ symmetry in supersymmetry framework, where we construct our lepton model as minimum modular weight as possible. We show our predictions on phases and neutrino masses through numerical analysis. We find a model that can fit in both normal and inverted hierarchy cases of neutrino mass. The predictions of neutrino observables are shown where we obtain more constrained allowed region in the inverted hierarchy case.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple model to obtain sizable muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment (muon $g-2$) introducing several $SU(2)_L$ multiplet fields without any additional symmetries. The neutrino mass matrix is simply induced via type-II seesaw scenario in terms of $SU(2)_L$ triplet Higgs with $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge 1. In addition, we introduce an $SU(2)_L$ quartet vector fermion with $1/2$ hypercharge and scalar with $3/2$ hypercharge. The quartet fermion plays a crucial role in explaining muon $g-2$ causing the chiral flip inside a loop diagram with mixing between triplet and quartet scalar bosons via the standard model Higgs. We show numerical analysis and search for allowed region in our parameter space, and demonstrate the collider physics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering New Higgses in the LHC Analyses of Differential $t\bar t$ Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistically significant tensions between the Standard Model (SM) predictions and the measured lepton distributions in differential top cross-sections emerged in LHC Run~1 data and became even more pronounced in Run~2 analyses. Due to the level of sophistication of the SM predictions and the performance of the ATLAS and CMS detectors, this is very remarkable. Therefore, one should seriously consider the possibility that these measurements are contaminated by beyond-the-SM contributions. In this article, we use differential lepton distributions from the latest ATLAS $t\bar t$ analysis to study a new physics benchmark model motivated by existing indications for new Higgses: a new scalar $H$ is produced via gluon fusion and decays to $S^\prime$ ($95\,$GeV) and $S$ ($152\,$GeV), which subsequently decay to $b\bar b$ and $WW$, respectively. In this setup, the total $\chi^2$ is reduced, compared to the SM, resulting in $\Delta\chi^2=34$ to $\Delta\chi^2=158$, depending on the SM simulation used. Notably, allowing $m_S$ to vary, the combination of the distributions points towards $m_S\!\approx\!150\,$GeV which is consistent with the existing $\gamma \gamma$ and $WW$ signals, rendering a mismodelling of the SM unlikely. Averaging the results of the different SM predictions, a non-vanishing cross-section for $pp\to H\to SS^\prime\to b\bar b WW$ of $\approx\!13$pb is preferred. If $S^\prime$ is SM-like, this cross-section, at the same time explains the $95\,$GeV $\gamma\gamma$ excess, while the dominance of $S\to WW$ suggests that $S$ is the neutral component of the $SU(2)_L$ triplet with hypercharge~0.</description>

      <title>QED effects in inclusive semi-leptonic $B$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse in detail the QED corrections to the total decay width and the moments of the electron energy spectrum of the inclusive semi-leptonic $B \to X_c e \nu$ decay. Our calculation includes short-distance electroweak corrections, the complete ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ partonic terms and leading-logarithmic QED effects up to ${\cal O}(\Lambda^3_{\rm QCD}/m_b^3)$. A comprehensive numerical comparison of our results against those obtained with the Monte Carlo (MC) tool PHOTOS is presented. While the comparison indicates good overall agreement, our computation contains QED effects not included in PHOTOS and should therefore better describe photon radiation to $B \to X_c e \nu$ as measured by the $B$-factories. Our calculations represent the first steps in the construction of a fully differential higher-order QED MC generator for inclusive semi-leptonic $B$ decays.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Annihilation via Breit-Wigner Enhancement with Heavier Mediator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario that both the dark matter freeze-out in the early Universe and its possible annihilation for indirect detection around a supermassive black hole are enhanced by a Breit-Wigner resonance. With the mediator mass larger than the total initial dark matter mass, this annihilation is almost forbidden at late times. Thus, the stringent cosmic microwave background and indirect detection constraints do not apply. However, a supermassive black hole can accelerate the dark matter particles to reactivate this resonant annihilation whose subsequent decay to photons leaves a unique signal. The running Fermi-LAT and the future COSI satellites can test this scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inclusive semileptonic $B\to X_c \ell\bar{\nu}$ decays can be described in the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) and allow for a precision determination of the CKM element $|V_{cb}|$. We calculate the terms of $1/m_b^5$ and derive a ``trace formula'' which allows for the computation of the decay rate and kinematic moments of the spectrum up to this order in the HQE. We focus specifically on the reparametrization invariant (RPI) dilepton invariant mass $q^2$ moments of the spectrum, which depend on a reduced set of HQE parameters. At this order, ``intrinsic charm'' (IC) contributions proportional to $1/(m_b^3m_c^2)$ enter, which are numerically expected to be sizeable. Using the ``lowest-lying state saturation ansatz'' (LLSA), we estimate the size of these contributions. Within this approximation, we observe a partial cancellation between the IC and the ``genuine'' $1/m_b^5$ contributions, resulting in a small overall contribution.</description>

After updating our set of measurements, we show how public ATLAS likelihoods can be incorporated into an external global analysis and how our analysis benefits from the additional information. We find that, unlike for the Higgs and electroweak sector, the SMEFT analysis of the top sector is mostly limited by the theory uncertainties. Finally, we present the first global SFitter analysis combining the top and electroweak-Higgs sectors.</description>

Abstract: We prove that collider searches for long-lived particles (LLPs) can test the dynamics responsible for matter domination in the early universe. In this letter we concentrate on the specific example of glueballs from a GeV-scale confining dark sector and compute the dilution of cosmological relics induced by their decay. We then show that searches for long-lived glueballs from Higgs decays test increasing values of dilution at ATLAS and CMS, CODEX-b, ANUBIS and MATHUSLA. We identify the general features that make models of early matter domination discoverable via LLPs at colliders. Our study provides a quantitative physics motivation to test longer lifetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of nucleons and nuclei has been a topic of enduring interest in high-energy physics. Gravitational form factors (GFFs) provide an important portal for us to probe the energy-momentum/mass distribution of nucleons and nuclei. This letter presents the study of the photon and gluon momentum GFFs, also known as the A-GFFs, of relativistic hadrons using the Weizs\"acker-Williams method. To begin, we express the photon A-GFFs in terms of charge form factors and discuss the corresponding photon radius. Furthermore, an integral relation between the gluon A-GFF and the Laplacian of dipole scattering amplitude is derived in the small-$x$ framework, and it allows us to unravel the gluon energy momentum distribution inside hadrons through measurements at the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. In addition, we generalize the analysis to study the A-GFF of nuclei and propose employing the nuclear gluon mean square radius, together with the charge distribution, to constrain the neutron distribution for large nuclei. This work provides an interesting perspective into the fundamental structure of high-energy hadrons.</description>

Abstract: A new fifth force between particles carrying $B-L$ charges is well-motivated by the intriguing $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model. The gauge boson mediator, F\'eeton, also serves as a dark matter candidate. In this letter, we propose a novel experimental design to detect the quantum phase difference caused by this fifth force using a superconducting Josephson junction. We find that the experiment has the best sensitivity to the gauge coupling when the gauge boson is within the mass range of $0.01\,$eV to $10\,$eV, which is an interesting mass region for the F\'eeton dark matter. This opens up a new avenue for the measurement of new physics at small scale below millimeter.</description>

      <title>The symmetry approach to quark and lepton masses and mixing</title>

Abstract: The Standard Model lacks an organizing principle to describe quark and lepton ``flavours''. Neutrino oscillation experiments show that leptons mix very differently from quarks, adding a major challenge to the flavour puzzle. We briefly sketch the seesaw and the dark-matter-mediated ``scotogenic'' neutrino mass generation approaches. We discuss the limitations of popular neutrino mixing patterns and examine the possibility that they arise from symmetry, giving a bottom-up approach to residual flavour and CP symmetries. We show how such family and/or CP symmetries can yield novel, viable and predictive mixing patterns. Model-independent ways to predict lepton mixing and neutrino mass sum rules are reviewed. We also discuss UV-complete flavour theories in four and more space-time dimensions. As benchmark examples we present an $A_4$ scotogenic construction with trimaximal mixing pattern TM2 and another with $S_4$ flavour symmetry and generalized CP symmetry. Higher-dimensional flavour completions are also briefly discussed, such as 5-D warped flavordynamics with a $T^\prime$ symmetry yielding a TM1 mixing pattern, detectable neutrinoless double beta decay rates and a very good global fit of flavour observables. We also mention 6-D orbifolds as a way to fix the structure of the 4-D family symmetry. We give a scotogenic benchmark orbifold model predicting the ``golden'' quark-lepton mass relation, stringent neutrino oscillation parameter regions, and an excellent global flavour fit, including quark observables. Finally, we discuss promising recent progress in tackling the flavor issue through the use of modular symmetries.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Composition of the Single-Charm Molecular Pentaquarks: Insights from Radiative Decay and Magnetic Moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to unravel the composition of the isoscalar $DN$, $D^*N$, $D_1N$, and $D_2^*N$ molecular pentaquarks, we carry out a systematic investigation of their M1 and E1 radiative decays and magnetic moment properties. Using the constituent quark model and taking into account the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect, our analysis yields numerical results indicating that the M1 and E1 radiative decays and the magnetic moment properties of these molecular pentaquarks provide some insights into their inner structures. These results can provide crucial clues for distinguishing their spin-parity quantum numbers and configurations in experimental studies. In addition, we highlight the importance of the electromagnetic properties as key observables for elucidating the inner structures of the observed $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$. We hope that these findings can inspire our experimental colleagues to further explore the family of the single-charm molecular pentaquarks and to investigate the inner structures of the $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$ in future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of inelastic (or pseudo-Dirac) dark matter commonly assume an accidental symmetry between the left-handed and right-handed mass terms in order to suppress diagonal couplings. We point out that this symmetry is unnecessary, because for Majorana fermions the diagonal couplings are not strongly constrained. Removing the requirement of such an ad-hoc symmetry instead relaxes the relic density constraint due to additional annihilation modes. We consider a simple UV-complete model realising this setup and study constraints from (in)direct detection, beam dump experiments and colliders. We identify two viable mass regions for the dark matter mass, around a few hundred MeV and around a few GeV, respectively. The former region will be fully tested by near-future analyses of NA64 and Belle II data, while the latter turns out to be challenging to explore even with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Quantum Mechanical Test of Gravity at Millimeter Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the Newton law of gravity at small scales has been a longstanding challenge. Recently, torsion balance experiments have successfully measured gravitational force at the millimeter scale. However, testing gravity force on quantum mechanical wave function at small scales remains difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel experiment that utilizes the Josephson effect to detect the different evolution of quantum phase induced from the potential difference caused by gravity. We demonstrate that this experiment can test gravity quantum mechanically at the millimeter scale, and also has a potential to investigate the parity invariance of gravity at small scales.</description>

Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>Observational bounds on a possible electron-to-proton mass ratio variation and constraints in the lepton-specific 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we test a possible redshift variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, $\mu = m_e/m_p$, directly from galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements and type Ia supernovae observations. Our result reveals no variation of $\mu$ within 1~$\sigma$. From the point of view of Particle Physics, we can use the precision on these results to constrain the parameter space of models beyond the Standard Model of electroweak interactions. We exemplify this by focusing on a specific Two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), where the second scalar doublet couples exclusively to leptons. An important parameter in the model concerns the ratio between its vacuum expectation values, defined by $\tan\beta\equiv v_2/v_1$. In our approach, we can constrain the inverse parameter $(\cot\beta)$ to an optimal value, $(\cot\beta)= (2.003 \pm 0.081)\cdot 10^{-3}$, with the highest vacuum expectation value for 2HDM, $v_2$, estimated at around $240.57 \pm 2.93$~GeV. Also, by taking into account the discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon found between theory and experiment, we can reduce the validity region for this model and establish bounds on the scalar masses, in light of our findings from galaxy cluster data for $\mu$. This study contributes valuable insights to the understanding of the interface between Particle Physics and Astrophysics, establishing a new interrelationship between data on the large-scale structure of the Universe and subatomic Physics.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Belle II result indicating a $2.7\,\sigma$ excess of $B^+\to K^+ + E_{\text{miss}}$ events compared to the Standard Model (SM) prediction for $B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar{\nu}$, we explore an explanation to this anomaly based on a KSVZ-type QCD axion model featuring a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking at high-scale, that can provide a solution to the strong CP problem with dark matter relic abundance. The model contains a PQ-charged scalar} leptoquark which can interact with the SM quarks only via mass-mixing of the latter with vector-like quarks. The mixing between SM and vector-like quarks is determined by the PQ mass scales and can explain the excess $B^+\to K^+ + E_{\text{miss}}$ events while respecting other flavour constraints. The same PQ-charged scalar leptoquarks and vector-like quarks also mediate the two-loop radiative neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Description of Wave Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a fundamentally quantum description of bosonic dark matter (DM) from which the conventional classical-wave picture emerges in the limit $m \ll 10~\textrm{eV}$. As appropriate for a quantum system, we start from the density matrix which encodes the full information regarding the possible measurements we could make of DM and their fluctuations. Following fundamental results in quantum optics, we argue that for DM it is most likely that the density matrix takes the explicitly mixed form of a Gaussian over the basis of coherent states. Deviations from this would generate non-Gaussian fluctuations in DM observables, allowing a direct probe of the quantum state of DM. Our quantum optics inspired approach allows us to rigorously define and interpret various quantities that are often only described heuristically, such as the coherence time or length. The formalism further provides a continuous description of DM through the wave-particle transition, which we exploit to study how density fluctuations over various physical scales evolve between the two limits and to reveal the unique behavior of DM near the boundary of the wave and particle descriptions.</description>

      <title>CP violation in two-meson Tau decays induced by heavy new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the effective field theory formalism that was used to study CP violation induced by heavy new physics in the $\tau\to K_S \pi\nu_\tau$ decays to the other two-meson tau decay channels. We focus on the rate and the forward-backward asymmetries, that are predicted using current bounds on the complex Wilson coefficients of the effective Lagrangian. We discuss our outcomes for the modes with $(K/\pi)\pi^0$ and $K K_S$, that can be studied at Belle-II and a super-tau-charm facility. Our main finding is that current and forthcoming experiments would be sensitive to the maximum allowed CP rate asymmetry in the $K^\pm K_S$ modes if a precision of $5\%$ is reached on this observable, that can check as well the BaBar anomaly in $K_S\pi$. For the $\pi^\pm\pi^0$ channels, new physics would be difficult to probe at present. Disentangling new sources of CP violation would be most challenging in $K^\pm\pi^0$ and the other modes.</description>

      <title>Scoto-seesaw model implied by flavor-dependent Abelian gauge charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming fundamental fermions possess a new Abelian gauge charge that depends on flavors of both quark and lepton, we obtain a simple extension of the Standard Model, which reveals some new physics insights. The new gauge charge anomaly cancellation not only explains the existence of just three fermion generations as observed but also requires the presence of a unique right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$ with a non-zero new gauge charge. Further, the new gauge charge breaking supplies a residual matter parity, under which the fundamental fermions and $\nu_R$ are even, whereas a right-handed neutrino $N_R$ without the new charge is odd. Consequently, light neutrino masses in our model are generated from the tree-level type-I seesaw mechanism induced by $\nu_R$ and from the one-loop scotogenic contribution accommodated by potential dark matter candidates, $N_R$ and dark scalars, odd under the matter parity. We examine new physics phenomena related to the additional gauge boson, which could be observed at colliders. We analyze the constraints imposed on our model by current experimental limits on neutrino masses, neutral meson oscillations, $B$-meson decays, and charged lepton flavor violating processes. We also investigate the potential dark matter candidates by considering relic density and direct detection.</description>

      <title>High-Energy and Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are capable of emitting extremely energetic particles independent of their interactions with the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate whether PBHs evaporating in the early universe could be responsible for some of the observed high-energy neutrinos above the TeV or PeV scale in the present universe. We compute the energy spectrum of neutrinos directly emitted by PBHs with a monochromatic mass function and estimate the wash-out point, which determines the maximum energy of the spectrum. We find that the spectrum generally extends to high energies following a power law of $E_{\nu}^{-3}$ until it reaches the wash-out point, which crucially depends on the PBH mass. For PBHs of $10^{13}$ grams, the spectrum can extend up to the PeV scale, though the flux is too low for detection. We also consider an indirect production mechanism involving dark particles that are emitted by PBHs and decay into neutrinos at a much later epoch. This mechanism allows lighter (such as those in the gram to kilogram range) PBHs to produce more energetic neutrino fluxes without being washed out by the thermal plasma in the early universe. In this scenario, we find that ultra-high-energy neutrinos around or above the EeV scale can be generated, with sufficiently high fluxes detectable by current and future high-energy neutrino observatories such as IceCube and GRAND.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion properties of an interacting hadron gas and evaluate the diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon, strange, electric, and charm quantum numbers. For the first time, this study sheds light on the charm current and estimates the diffusion matrix coefficient for the charmed states by treating them as a part of the quasi-thermalized medium. We explore the diffusion matrix coefficient as a function of temperature and center-of-mass energy. A van der Waals-like interaction is assumed between the hadrons, including attractive and repulsive interactions. The calculation of diffusion coefficients is based on relaxation time approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation. A good agreement with available model calculations is observed in the hadronic limit. To conclude the study, we discuss, with a detailed explanation, that charm fluctuation is expected to be a better tool for probing the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Transition rate and gravitational wave spectrum from first-order QCD phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational wave spectrum induced by first-order QCD phase transitions including the deconfinement phase transition in the pure gluon system and Friedberg-Lee model, and chiral phase transition in the quark-meson model and Polyakov quark-meson model. The gravitational wave power spectra are sensitive to the phase transition rate $\beta/H$. All QCD models predict a rather large phase transition rate in the order of $\beta/H\sim10^4$ at high temperature region, and the produced gravitational waves lie in the peak frequency region of $10^{-4}-0.01 {\rm Hz}$, corresponding to an energy spectrum in the range of $10^{-8}-10^{-7}$, which can be detected by LISA and Taiji. If a high baryon density is generated through Affleck-Dine baryogenesis or other mechanisms, the baryon chemical potential significantly reduces the phase transition rate, potentially dropping it to the order of $\beta/H\sim 10^1$, leading to the production of nanohertz gravitational waves. Furthermore, a critical quark chemical potential exists with a zero phase transition rate $\beta/H=0$, indicating that the false vacuum will not decay, thus supporting the formation of primordial quark nuggets in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the f\'eeton (gauge boson of $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry) dark matter scenario, and first point out the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry can be a linear combination of the $B-L$ and the SM hypercharge gauge symmetries. With the redefinition of $B-L$ charge of fermions, the coupling between electron and f\'eeton can be enhanced. After showing the parameter space required from the DM stability and cosmic production, we discuss the potential for verifying them in dark matter direct detection experiments. The results show that future experiments, such as SuperCDMS, have a sensitivity to reach the f\'eeton DM region consistent with its cosmic production.</description>

      <title>Confronting the broken phase N2HDM with Higgs Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The broken phase of the Next-to two-Higgs-doublet model (N2HDM) constitutes an archetype of extended Higgs sectors. In the presence of a softly-broken $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry throughout the scalar and Yukawa sectors, as the additional gauge singlet field does not interact with fermions, the model admits four variants of Yukawa interactions between the doublets and Standard Model fermions. We confront each type with experimental Higgs data, especially from CMS and ATLAS detectors at the LHC. Interfacing the models with the the state-of-the-art package $\mathtt{HiggsTools}$, we perform a statistical $\chi^2$ analysis to determine the best-fit points and exclusion limits at the $95\%$ and $68\%$ C.L., and identify SM-like Higgs measurements that affect each type the most. We further analyze the exclusion bounds on the additional Higgs bosons at the $95\%$ C.L., paying special attention to searches of hypothetical non-SM Higgs resonances decaying into a pair of bosons or fermions. We show regions where the additional Higgs bosons do not satisfy the narrow-width approximation utilized in most experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Study on the structure of the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state within the framework of effective field theory. We firstly show the construction of the Lagrangian describing meson-meson-meson and meson-diquark-diquark interactions. By using the Feynman rule, we calculate the effective potentials corresponding to the coupled channels of $D\bar{D}^{*}/D^{*}\bar{D}$ and $S_{cq}\bar{A}_{cq}/A_{cq}\bar{S}_{cq}$ with $S_{cq}$ ($A_{cq}$) the scalar (axial vector) diquark composed of $c$ and $q$ quarks. After solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the on-shell parametrized form and compare our numerical results with the experimental mass and width of $Z_{c}(3900)$, we find that the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state can be explained as the mixture of $D\bar{D}^{*}/D^{*}\bar{D}$ and $S_{cq}\bar{A}_{cq}/A_{cq}\bar{S}_{cq}$ components.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Study on axial fields in the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamically assisted Schwinger effect, the generation of fermion-antifermion pairs in vacuum under a strong, slow-varying field and a weak, high-frequency field, has become a promising avenue to probe the vacuum structure and the nonlinear dynamics of QED. However, the role of axial fields in this phenomenon has remained underexplored. This study aims at analyzing how spatial axial fields influence particle production in the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect. Employing the high-frequency effective theory based on the Floquet-Magnus expansion, we demonstrate that a spatial axial field can occur as the effective field of a circular polarized high-frequency plane wave and significantly increase the number of fermions produced across different timescales. This enhancement offers both theoretical insights and useful tools for the experimental implementation of the Schwinger effect.</description>

      <title>Probing ALP couplings to electroweak gauge bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the more and more abundant experimental data, we revisit the couplings of axion-like particle (ALP) to electroweak gauge bosons across the ALP mass range from MeV to 100 GeV. The current and future experimental limits on the couplings are extended. The ALP coupling to $W$-bosons gives rise to flavor-changing ALP-quark couplings at the one-loop level. These flavor-changing couplings deserve further investigation under current experimental constraints, especially those stemming from rare meson decays and neutral meson mixing processes. Additionally, flavor-conserving couplings of the ALP to Standard Model (SM) fermions arise at the one-loop level as well from ALP-electroweak gauge boson couplings, even in the absence of tree-level couplings to these SM fermions, with consequent ALP decays to the SM fermions leading to constraints on the ALP-electroweak gauge boson couplings. We also investigate processes relevant to $Z$-boson measurements, such as the invisible decay $Z\to a\gamma$, subsequent decays
  $Z\to 3\gamma$ and $Z\to \gamma ll$, as well as constraints from oblique parameters ($S,\, T,\, U$). Our study highlights that rare two-body decays of pseudoscalar mesons offer the most sensitive probes of ALP couplings to electroweak gauge bosons from the loop-induced flavor-violating interactions for ALP masses below the kinematic threshold, while $Z$-boson decays complementarily explore larger ALP masses. Future lepton colliders, such as CEPC and FCC-ee operating at the $Z$-pole, along with SHiP, provide further opportunities to probe ALP couplings to electroweak gauge bosons.</description>

      <title>Neutrino reheating predictions with non-thermal leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connecting inflation with neutrino physics through non-thermal leptogenesis via direct inflaton-right-handed neutrino (RHN) coupling naturally incorporates neutrino reheating, leaving no ambiguity regarding the early history of the Universe. In ref.~\cite{Zhang:2023oyo}, we demonstrate that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay expands the viable parameter space compared to thermal leptogenesis and provides a natural link to inflation. In this work, we refine our previous findings by closely examining the dynamics of neutrino reheating. We first calculate the duration of neutrino reheating on a general basis, then analyze inflationary observables consistent with neutrino reheating across four models, establishing a direct connection between baryon asymmetry and the spectral index. This approach places these two important observables on the same plane and yields specific predictions that help break the degeneracy among inflationary models. The well-motivated and economical framework offers a simple, natural, and testable description of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretical approach to neutral pion contribution to muon $g-2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hadronic light-by-light scattering induces a substantial contribution to the muon $g-2$ with present accuracy of its measurement. The effect caused by the neutral pion through this scattering on the muon $g-2$ has been scrutinized intensively by model calculation and lattice QCD simulation. All of those estimates have been done based on one formula, but it has one pathological aspect. The purpose of this article is to resolve such a pathology from a field-theoretical approach, i.e., by defining the effect in question as the neutral pion intermediate state contribution to the QCD vacuum expectation value of time-ordered product of four electromagnetic currents. It leads (1) the pion pole term corresponding to the imaginary part of the pion propagator $\frac{1}{q^2 - m_\pi^2 + \mathrm{i} \epsilon}$, (2) and no principle value term corresponding to its real part, resolving the pathology.</description>

      <title>Unitarity triangle angles explained: a predictive new quark mass matrix texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quark mass matrix texture-pair with five free parameters, which fits the four quark mass ratios $m_s/m_b$, $m_d/m_b$, $m_c/m_t$, $m_u/m_t$, and the four CKM quark mixing observables. The matrices each have one texture zero, but the main innovation here is a ``geometric'' ansatz exploiting a pair of small complex expansion parameters, based on the geometry of the Unitarity Triangle. The fit to the observables is in good agreement with current experimental values renormalised to $\sim\!\!10^4$ TeV, and offers decisive tests against future high-precision measurements of the unitarity triangle angles at the weak scale. We identify two novel symmetries of these mass matrices which explain the phenomenologically-successful relations $\alpha\equiv\phi_2\simeq\pibytwo$ and $\beta\equiv\phi_1\simeq\pibyeight$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unexpectedly large and puzzling spin alignment, and thus tensor polarization, of vector mesons has been observed in heavy-ion collisions. Given that tensor polarization represents a fluctuation of spin, we derive, for the first time, a fluctuation-dissipation relation for tensor polarization, where the polarization is proportional to first-order hydrodynamic gradients (e.g., the shear-stress tensor), with dissipative coefficients depending on the particle's damping properties, as characterized by its spectral function. Phenomenologically, we find that the dissipative contributions have the potential to generate substantial spin alignment and give rise to complex behaviors, providing insights that may help explain the puzzling phenomena observed in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariant quantum field theories (QFTs) with fermions in four spacetime dimensions (4D) have a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry provided there exists a basis of operators in the QFT where all operators have even operator dimension, $d$, including those with $d &gt; 4$. The $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is the extension of operator dimension parity by fermion number parity. If the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is anomaly-free, such QFTs can be related to 3D topological superconductors. Additionally, imposing the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry on the Standard Model effective field theory severely restricts the allowed processes that violate baryon and lepton numbers.</description>

      <title>Robust integration of fast flavor conversions in classical neutrino transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum kinetic evolution of neutrinos in dense environments, such as the core-collapse supernovae or the neutron star mergers, can result in fast flavor conversion (FFC), presenting a significant challenge to achieving robust astrophysical modeling of these systems. Recent works that directly simulate the quantum kinetic transport of neutrinos in localized domains have suggested that the asymptotic outcome of FFCs can be modeled by simple analytical prescriptions when coarse grained over a size much larger than the FFC length scale. In this Letter, by leveraging such a scale separation, we incorporate the analytical prescriptions into global simulations that solve the classical neutrino transport equation including collisions and advection under spherical symmetry. We demonstrate that taking this approach allows to obtain results that quantitatively agree with those directly from the corresponding global quantum kinetic simulations and precisely capture the collisional feedback effect for cases where the FFC happens inside the neutrinosphere. Notably, the effective scheme does not require resolving the FFC time and length scales, hence only adds negligible computational overhead to classical transport. Our work highlights that efficient and robust integration of FFCs in classical neutrino transport used in astrophysical simulation can be feasible.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the WQFT partition function, specifically the eikonal phase in a black hole scattering event in the dynamical Chern-Simons theory, using the techniques of spinning worldline quantum field theory. We consider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary details for the calculation of the partition function. We present the $\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques, which we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to 3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin orientations of the black holes.</description>

      <title>Bounding elastic photon-photon scattering at $\sqrt s \approx 1\,$MeV using a laser-plasma platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a direct search for elastic photon-photon scattering using x-ray and $\gamma$ photons from a laser-plasma based experiment. A gamma photon beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator provided a broadband gamma spectrum extending to above $E_\gamma = 200$ MeV. These were collided with a dense x-ray field produced by the emission from a laser heated germanium foil at $E_x \approx 1.4$ keV, corresponding to an invariant mass of $\sqrt{s} = 1.22 \pm 0.22$ MeV. In these asymmetric collisions elastic scattering removes one x-ray and one high-energy $\gamma$ photon and outputs two lower energy $\gamma$ photons. No changes in the $\gamma$ photon spectrum were observed as a result of the collisions allowing us to place a 95% upper bound on the cross section of $1.5 \times 10^{15}\,\mu$b. Although far from the QED prediction, this represents the lowest upper limit obtained so far for $\sqrt{s} \lesssim 1$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of glueballs in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents preliminary results of the first determination of the energy-momentum tensor form factors of the scalar glueball, referred to as gravitational form factors (GFFs). The calculation has been carried out in lattice Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing. Using variationally optimized operators, the matrix elements are extracted from ratios of three-point functions to two-point functions. The glueball GFFs and their kinematic dependence are compared to those of other hadrons from previous calculations.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>Chiral gauge theories, generalized anomalies and breakdown of the color-flavor-locked center symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the strong-interaction dynamics of a class of $4D$ chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories with a fermion in a symmetric second-rank tensor representation and a number of fermions in an anti-antisymmetric tensor representation, extending the previous work on chiral gauge theories such as the Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. The main tool of our analysis is the anomalies obstructing the gauging of certain 1-form color-flavor-locked center symmetry, together with some flavor symmetries. The matching requirement for these mixed-anomalies strongly favors dynamical Higgs phases caused by bifermion condensate formation, against a confinement phase with no condensates and no symmetry breaking, or a confinement phase with multifermion color-singlet condensates only. Dynamical gauge symmetry breaking and the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry caused by such condensates mean that the color-flavor-locked 1-form center symmetry itself is lost in the infrared. One is led to a solution, if not unique, which satisfies fully the conventional as well as the new, generalized 't Hooft anomaly matching requirements.</description>

      <title>Can black holes be formed by focussing radiation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes are extreme outcomes of General Relativity, and can form through a variety of ways, including gravitational collapse of massive stars, or quantum fluctuations in the early universe. Here, we ask the question of whether they can form via focusing of radiation by compact binaries or intense lasers, or via trapping at the light ring of black holes. We provide evidence that gravitational lensing of radiation from a small, finite number of sources is not a viable mechanism to form black holes.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB B-modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition can produce a B-mode signal whose strength rivals that of testable inflationary predictions across a range of observable scales. Although phase transitions arise from causal sub-horizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on super-horizon scales. Power is suppressed on the large scales relevant for CMB B-mode polarization, but it is not necessarily negligible. For appropriately chosen phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude can compete with inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. These scenarios can be differentiated by performing measurements on multiple angular scales, since the phase transition signal predicts peak power on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Utility of a hybrid approach to the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate calculation of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarisation (LOHVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu$) is key to determining whether a discrepancy, suggesting new physics, exists between the Standard Model and experimental results. This calculation can be expressed as an integral over Euclidean time of a current-current correlator $G(t)$, where $G(t)$ can be calculated using lattice QCD or, with dispersion relations, from experimental data for $e^+e^-\to\mbox{hadrons}$. The BMW/DMZ collaboration recently presented a hybrid approach in which $G(t)$ is calculated using lattice QCD for most of the contributing $t$ range, but using experimental data for the largest $t$ (lowest energy) region. Here we study the advantages of varying the position $t=t_1$ separating lattice QCD from data-driven contributions. The total LOHVP contribution should be independent of $t_1$, providing both a test of the experimental input and the robustness of the hybrid approach. We use this criterion and a correlated fit to show that Fermilab/HPQCD/MILC lattice QCD results from 2019 strongly favour the CMD-3 cross-section data for $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ over a combination of earlier experimental results for this channel. Further, the resulting total LOHVP contribution obtained is consistent with the result obtained by BMW/DMZ, and supports the scenario in which there is no significant discrepancy between the experimental value for $a_\mu$ and that expected in the Standard Model. We then discuss how improved lattice results in this hybrid approach could provide a more accurate total LOHVP across a wider range of $t_1$ values with an uncertainty that is smaller than that from either lattice QCD or data-driven approaches on their own.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the subtraction function in forward Compton amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subtraction function plays a pivotal role in calculations involving the forward Compton amplitude, which is crucial for predicting the Lamb shift in muonic atom, as well as the proton-neutron mass difference. In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the subtraction function using two domain wall fermion gauge ensembles at the physical pion mass. We utilize a recently proposed subtraction point, demonstrating its advantage in mitigating statistical and systematic uncertainties by eliminating the need for ground-state subtraction. Our results reveal significant contributions from $N\pi$ intermediate states to the subtraction function. Incorporating these contributions, we compute the proton, neutron and nucleon isovector subtraction functions at photon momentum transfer $Q^2\in[0,2]$ GeV$^2$. For the proton subtraction function, we compare our lattice results with chiral perturbation theory prediction at low $Q^2$ and with the results from the perturbative operator-product expansion at high $Q^2$. Finally, using these subtraction functions as input, we determine their contribution to two-photon exchange effects in the Lamb shift and isovector nucleon electromagnetic self-energy.</description>
