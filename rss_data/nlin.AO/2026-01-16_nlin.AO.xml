      <title>Vibrational resonance in coupled self-learning Duffing oscillators and its application in noisy radio frequency signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new coupled array of frequency-adaptive Duffing oscillators. Based on learning rules, the natural frequency of each oscillator changes with the external excitation to achieve the frequency-adaptive capability in the response. The frequency range of vibrational resonance in the response is greatly extended through the frequency-adaptive learning rule. Moreover, the theoretical condition for vibrational resonance is derived and its validity is verified numerically. The coupled self-learning Duffing oscillators can also perform signal denoising in strong noise environment, and its performance in signal denoising has been verified through processing the simulated signal and the wireless radio frequency signal under two scenarios. The superiority of vibrational resonance to the conventional denosing methods such as wavelet transform and Kalman filter has also been illustrated by experimental radio frequency signal processing. The combination of broadband frequency adaptability and strong noise-reduction capability suggests that these oscillators hold considerable potential for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>The multi-allelic Moran process as a multi-zealot voter model: exact results and consequences for diversity thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moran process is a foundational model of genetic drift and mutation in finite populations. In its standard two-allele form with population size $n$, allele counts, and hence allele frequencies, change through stochastic replacement and mutation, yet converge to a stationary distribution. This distribution undergoes a qualitative transition at the \emph{critical mutation rate} $\mu_c=1/(2n)$: at $\mu=\mu_c$ it is exactly uniform, so that the probability of observing $k$ copies of allele~1 (and $n-k$ of allele~2) is $\pi(k)=1/(n+1)$ for $k=0,\dots,n$. For $\mu&lt;\mu_c$ diversity is low: the stationary distribution places most of its mass near $k=0$ and $k=n$, and the population is therefore typically dominated by one allele. For $\mu&gt;\mu_c$, on the other hand, diversity is high: the distribution concentrates around intermediate values, so that both alleles are commonly present at comparable frequencies. Recently, the two-allele Moran process was shown to be exactly equivalent to the voter model with two candidates and $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ committed voters (\emph{zealots}) in a population of $n+\alpha_1+\alpha_2$, where mutation is played by zealot influence. Here we extend this equivalence to multiple alleles and multiple candidates. Using the mapping, we derive the exact stationary distribution of allele counts for well-mixed populations with an arbitrary number $m$ of alleles, and obtain the critical mutation rate $\mu_c = 1/(m+2n-2)$, which depends explicitly on $m$. We then analyze the Moran process on randomly connected populations and show that both the stationary distribution and $\mu_c$ are invariant to network structure and coincide with the well-mixed results. Finally, simulations on general network topologies show that structural heterogeneity can substantially reshape the stationary allele distribution and, consequently, the level of genetic diversity.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic dynamics of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons subject to correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of correlated noise, arising from a mixture of independent fluctuations and a common noisy input shared across the neural population, is a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits, yet its impact on collective network dynamics remains poorly understood. We analyze a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Gaussian noise with a tunable degree of correlation. Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population's mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronization with Annealed Disorder and Higher-Harmonic Interactions in Arbitrary Dimensions: When Two Dimensions Are Special</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of disorder on collective phenomena depends crucially on whether it is quenched or annealed. In synchronization problems, quenched disorder in higher dimensional Kuramoto models is known to produce unconventional dimensional effects, including a striking odd even dichotomy: synchronization transitions are continuous in even dimensions and discontinuous in odd dimensions. By contrast, the impact of annealed disorder has received comparatively little attention. Here we study a D dimensional Kuramoto model with both fundamental and higher-harmonic interactions under annealed disorder, and develop an arbitrary dimensional center-manifold framework to analyze the nonlinear dynamics near the onset of collective behavior. We show that annealed disorder fundamentally alters the role of dimensionality. With fundamental coupling alone, it completely removes the odd even dichotomy, yielding continuous synchronization transitions with universal mean-field scaling in all dimensions. Higher-harmonic interactions preserve this universality while rendering the synchronization transition tunable between continuous and discontinuous. At the same time, they give rise to a novel, correlation-driven transition between a symmetry-protected incoherent phase and a symmetry broken state lacking global synchronization, which is therefore invisible to the conventional Kuramoto order parameter. This transition is continuous in two dimensions but discontinuous in higher dimensions, revealing an emergent and previously-unrecognized special role of two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interplay of sync and swarm: Theory and application of swarmalators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swarmalators, entities that combine the properties of swarming particles with synchronized oscillations, represent a novel and growing area of research in the study of collective behavior. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of swarmalator research, focusing on the interplay between spatial organization and temporal synchronization. After a brief introduction to synchronization and swarming as separate phenomena, we discuss the various mathematical models that have been developed to describe swarmalator systems, highlighting the key parameters that govern their dynamics. The review also discusses the emergence of complex patterns, such as clustering, phase waves, and synchronized states, and how these patterns are influenced by factors such as interaction range, coupling strength, and frequency distribution. Recently, some minimal models were proposed that are solvable and mimic real-world phenomena. The effect of predators in the swarmalator dynamics is also discussed. Finally, we explore potential applications in fields ranging from robotics to biological systems, where understanding the dual nature of swarming and synchronization could lead to innovative solutions. By synthesizing recent advances and identifying open challenges, this review aims to provide a foundation for future research in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Topological constraints on self-organisation in locally interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>
