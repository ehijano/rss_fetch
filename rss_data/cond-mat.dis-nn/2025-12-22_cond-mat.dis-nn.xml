      <title>Growth of Dynamic and Static Correlations in the Aging Dynamics of a Glass-Forming Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we have performed finite-size scaling (FSS) in the aging regime of a model glass-forming liquid to investigate how the length scales associated with amorphous order (static length) and dynamic heterogeneity (dynamic length) evolve with waiting time. The $\alpha$-relaxation time in the aging regime reveals non-monotonic finite-size effects with a peak at an intermediate system size, which, as far as we know, are not found in the equilibrium systems, and the peak position shifts to larger system sizes with decreasing temperature and increasing waiting time, indicating a growth of a characteristic length scale with waiting time. The extracted correlation volume associated with amorphous order increases logarithmically with the waiting time. Detailed analysis of the dependence of the length scale on waiting time allowed us to estimate the static length scale in the deep supercooled liquid regime. The dynamic length scale, obtained from FSS and block analysis of the four-point dynamic susceptibility, follows a power-law growth with waiting time. The values of the length scales obtained agree well with those obtained from different spatial correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Modelling financial time series with $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory with inhomogeneous couplings and explicit symmetry-breaking to model an ensemble of financial time series from the S$\&amp;$P 500 index. The continuum nature of the $\phi^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $\phi^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks. We conclude by discussing how the $\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory could be used to build investment strategies and the possible intuitions that the QFT operations of dimensional compactification and renormalization can provide for financial modelling.</description>

      <title>Novel Kuramoto model with inhibition dynamics modeling scale-free avalanches and synchronization in neuronal cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal cultures exhibit a complex activity, bursts, or avalanches, characterized by the coexistence of scale invariance and synchronization, quite stable with the percentage of inhibitory neurons. While this bistable behavior has been already observed in the past, the characterization of the statistical properties of avalanche activity and their temporal organization is still lacking, as well as a model able to reproduce these dynamics. Here, we analyze experimental data of human neuronal cultures with controlled percentage of inhibitory neurons and characterize their statistical properties and dynamical organization. In order to model the experimental data, we propose a novel version of the Kuramoto model for two populations of oscillators, excitatory and inhibitory, implementing successfully the inhibition dynamics. The model can fully reproduce the experimental results, confirming the existence of correlations in the temporal organization of avalanche activity and the presence of an amplification - attenuation regime, as found in the human brain.</description>

      <title>Perfect reconstruction of sparse signals using nonconvexity control and one-step RSB message passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider sparse signal reconstruction via minimization of the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, and develop one-step replica-symmetry-breaking (1RSB) extensions of approximate message passing (AMP), termed 1RSB-AMP. Starting from the 1RSB formulation of belief propagation, we derive explicit update rules of 1RSB-AMP together with the corresponding state evolution (1RSB-SE) equations. A detailed comparison shows that 1RSB-AMP and 1RSB-SE agree remarkably well at the macroscopic level, even in parameter regions where replica-symmetric (RS) AMP, termed RS-AMP, diverges and where the 1RSB description itself is not expected to be thermodynamically exact. Fixed-point analysis of 1RSB-SE reveals a phase diagram consisting of success, failure, and diverging phases, as in the RS case. However, the diverging-region boundary now depends on the Parisi parameter due to the 1RSB ansatz, and we propose a new criterion -- minimizing the size of the diverging region -- rather than the conventional zero-complexity condition, to determine its value. Combining this criterion with the nonconvexity-control (NCC) protocol proposed in a previous RS study improves the algorithmic limit of perfect reconstruction compared with RS-AMP. Numerical solutions of 1RSB-SE and experiments with 1RSB-AMP confirm that this improved limit is achieved in practice, though the gain is modest and remains slightly inferior to the Bayes-optimal threshold. We also report the behavior of thermodynamic quantities -- overlaps, free entropy, complexity, and the non-self-averaging susceptibility -- that characterize the 1RSB phase in this problem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin breathing modes in one-dimensional nonreciprocal mechanical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in a one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain of classical oscillators coupled by asymmetric springs, akin to a mechanical analogue of the Hatano-Nelson model with onsite nonlinearity. Using multiple-scale analysis, we show that families of nonlinear skin breathing modes -- time-periodic, boundary-localized oscillations -- emerge from their linear counterparts at any nonreciprocal strength. We derive an explicit nonlinear frequency shift for these families of nonlinear breathing modes, showing its dependence on amplitude, nonlinearity type, lattice size, and nonreciprocity, and we predict the emergence of genuine skin end breathers at the boundary once their oscillation frequency and higher harmonics enter the spectral gaps of the linear spectrum. Numerical pseudo-arclength continuation confirms full families of solutions for both hardening and softening nonlinearities. Furthermore, the Floquet analysis shows that these modes can be either linearly stable or unstable, with Floquet eigenvectors exhibiting skin localization inherited from the asymmetric couplings. Our results extend the nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect from stationary modes to intrinsically time-periodic excitations, providing a pathway to engineer and control breathing modes in nonreciprocal mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze regional earthquake energy statistics from the Southern California and Japan seismic catalogs and find scale-invariant energy distributions characterized by an exponent $\tau \simeq 1.67$. To quantify how closely scale-invariant dynamics with different exponent values resemble real earthquakes, we generate synthetic energy distributions over a wide range of $\tau$ under conditions of constant activity. Earthquake-like behavior, in a broad sense, is obtained for $1.5 \leqslant \tau &lt; 2.0$. When energy variations are further restricted to be within a factor of ten relative to real earthquakes, the admissible range narrows to $1.58 \leqslant \tau \leqslant 1.76$. We identify the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics in the different regimes: fault dynamics characterized by a balance between slow energy accumulation and release through scale-free events in the earthquake-like regime; externally supplied energy relative to a slowly driven fault for $\tau &lt; 1.5$; and dominance of small events in the energy budget for $\tau &gt; 2$</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Reversible Plasticity in an Amorphous Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local rearrangements are the elements of plastic deformation in an amorphous solid. In oscillatory shear, they can switch reversibly between two distinct configurations. While these repeating relaxations are typically considered in the limit of slow driving, their dynamics is less well understood. We perform experiments on a colloidal amorphous solid at an oil-water interface. The rearrangement timescales we observe span at least 1 decade, with no apparent upper bound. As frequency is increased, individual rearrangements appear faster and more hysteretic, but may disappear entirely above a crossover frequency -- suggesting that in practical experiments, the slowest rearrangements may be latent. We show how to find the effective potential energy that reproduces a particle's frequency-dependent motion. In rare cases, this potential energy has only one minimum. Our results have implications for the energy landscapes and rheology of amorphous or glassy solids, for sound propagation in nonlinear media, and for mechanical memory and history-dependence.</description>

      <title>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\"{a}tze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Focusing on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We provide evidence that the nature of the instability stems from stiffness of the dynamics of the variational parameters, despite the absence of stiffness in the exact quantum dynamics. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</description>

      <title>Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin $1/2$ particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin-orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Quantum Transport Simulations in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</description>
