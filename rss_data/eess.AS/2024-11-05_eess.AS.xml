      <title>An incremental algorithm based on multichannel non-negative matrix partial co-factorization for ambient denoising in auscultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to implement a method to remove ambient noise in biomedical sounds captured in auscultation. We propose an incremental approach based on multichannel non-negative matrix partial co-factorization (NMPCF) for ambient denoising focusing on high noisy environment with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) &lt;= -5 dB. The first contribution applies NMPCF assuming that ambient noise can be modelled as repetitive sound events simultaneously found in two single-channel inputs captured by means of different recording devices. The second contribution proposes an incremental algorithm, based on the previous multichannel NMPCF, that refines the estimated biomedical spectrogram throughout a set of incremental stages by eliminating most of the ambient noise that was not removed in the previous stage at the expense of preserving most of the biomedical spectral content. The ambient denoising performance of the proposed method, compared to some of the most relevant state-of-the-art methods, has been evaluated using a set of recordings composed of biomedical sounds mixed with ambient noise that typically surrounds a medical consultation room to simulate high noisy environments with a SNR from -20 dB to -5 dB. Experimental results report that: (i) the performance drop suffered by the proposed method is lower compared to MSS and NLMS; (ii) unlike what happens with MSS and NLMS, the proposed method shows a stable trend of the average SDR and SIR results regardless of the type of ambient noise and the SNR level evaluated; and (iii) a remarkable advantage is the high robustness of the estimated biomedical sounds when the two single-channel inputs suffer from a delay between them.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM and Text-Queried Separation for Noise-Robust Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound Event Detection (SED) is challenging in noisy environments where overlapping sounds obscure target events. Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) aims to isolate the target sound events from a noisy clip. However, this approach can fail when the exact target sound is unknown, particularly in noisy test sets, leading to reduced performance. To address this issue, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to analyze and summarize acoustic data. By using LLMs to identify and select specific noise types, we implement a noise augmentation method for noise-robust fine-tuning. The fine-tuned model is applied to predict clip-wise event predictions as text queries for the LASS model. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves SED performance in noisy environments. This work represents an early application of LLMs in noise-robust SED and suggests a promising direction for handling overlapping events in SED. Codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/apple-yinhan/Noise-robust-SED.</description>

      <title>Modulating State Space Model with SlowFast Framework for Compute-Efficient Ultra Low-Latency Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based speech enhancement (SE) methods often face significant computational challenges when needing to meet low-latency requirements because of the increased number of frames to be processed. This paper introduces the SlowFast framework which aims to reduce computation costs specifically when low-latency enhancement is needed. The framework consists of a slow branch that analyzes the acoustic environment at a low frame rate, and a fast branch that performs SE in the time domain at the needed higher frame rate to match the required latency. Specifically, the fast branch employs a state space model where its state transition process is dynamically modulated by the slow branch. Experiments on a SE task with a 2 ms algorithmic latency requirement using the Voice Bank + Demand dataset show that our approach reduces computation cost by 70% compared to a baseline single-branch network with equivalent parameters, without compromising enhancement performance. Furthermore, by leveraging the SlowFast framework, we implemented a network that achieves an algorithmic latency of just 60 {\mu}s (one sample point at 16 kHz sample rate) with a computation cost of 100 M MACs/s, while scoring a PESQ-NB of 3.12 and SISNR of 16.62.</description>

      <title>Complete reconstruction of the tongue contour through acoustic to articulatory inversion using real-time MRI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic articulatory inversion is a major processing challenge, with a wide range of applications from speech synthesis to feedback systems for language learning and rehabilitation. In recent years, deep learning methods have been applied to the inversion of less than a dozen geometrical positions corresponding to sensors glued to easily accessible articulators. It is therefore impossible to know the shape of the whole tongue from root to tip. In this work, we use high-quality real-time MRI data to track the contour of the tongue. The data used to drive the inversion are therefore the unstructured speech signal and the tongue contours. Several architectures relying on a Bi-MSTM including or not an autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of the latent space, using or not the phonetic segmentation have been explored. The results show that the tongue contour can be recovered with a median accuracy of 2.21 mm (or 1.37 pixel) taking a context of 1 MFCC frame (static, delta and double-delta cepstral features).</description>

      <title>Joint Training of Speaker Embedding Extractor, Speech and Overlap Detection for Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of the popularity of end-to-end diarization systems nowadays, modular systems comprised of voice activity detection (VAD), speaker embedding extraction plus clustering, and overlapped speech detection (OSD) plus handling still attain competitive performance in many conditions. However, one of the main drawbacks of modular systems is the need to run (and train) different modules independently. In this work, we propose an approach to jointly train a model to produce speaker embeddings, VAD and OSD simultaneously and reach competitive performance at a fraction of the inference time of a standard approach. Furthermore, the joint inference leads to a simplified overall pipeline which brings us one step closer to a unified clustering-based method that can be trained end-to-end towards a diarization-specific objective.</description>

      <title>Personality Analysis from Online Short Video Platforms with Multi-domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personality analysis from online short videos has gained prominence due to its applications in personalized recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, and human-computer interaction. Traditional assessment methods, such as questionnaires based on the Big Five Personality Framework, are limited by self-report biases and are impractical for large-scale or real-time analysis. Leveraging the rich, multi-modal data present in short videos offers a promising alternative for more accurate personality inference. However, integrating these diverse and asynchronous modalities poses significant challenges, particularly in aligning time-varying data and ensuring models generalize well to new domains with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal personality analysis framework that addresses these challenges by synchronizing and integrating features from multiple modalities and enhancing model generalization through domain adaptation. We introduce a timestamp-based modality alignment mechanism that synchronizes data based on spoken word timestamps, ensuring accurate correspondence across modalities and facilitating effective feature integration. To capture temporal dependencies and inter-modal interactions, we employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks and self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on the most informative features for personality prediction. Furthermore, we develop a gradient-based domain adaptation method that transfers knowledge from multiple source domains to improve performance in target domains with scarce labeled data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in personality prediction tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing complex behavioral cues and robustness in adapting to new domains.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AAC Software for Dysarthric Speakers in e-Health Settings: An Evaluation Using TORGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frequently face challenges with articulation, leading to dysarthria and resulting in atypical speech patterns. In healthcare settings, coomunication breakdowns reduce the quality of care. While building an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tool to enable fluid communication we found that state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology like Whisper and Wav2vec2.0 marginalizes atypical speakers largely due to the lack of training data. Our work looks to leverage SOTA ASR followed by domain specific error-correction. English dysarthric ASR performance is often evaluated on the TORGO dataset. Prompt-overlap is a well-known issue with this dataset where phrases overlap between training and test speakers. Our work proposes an algorithm to break this prompt-overlap. After reducing prompt-overlap, results with SOTA ASR models produce extremely high word error rates for speakers with mild and severe dysarthria. Furthermore, to improve ASR, our work looks at the impact of n-gram language models and large-language model (LLM) based multi-modal generative error-correction algorithms like Whispering-LLaMA for a second pass ASR. Our work highlights how much more needs to be done to improve ASR for atypical speakers to enable equitable healthcare access both in-person and in e-health settings.</description>

      <title>Music Foundation Model as Generic Booster for Music Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of using intermediate representations from a single foundation model to enhance various music downstream tasks. We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity. This paves the way for more effective and accessible music processing solutions.</description>

      <title>Fish-Speech: Leveraging Large Language Models for Advanced Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems face ongoing challenges in processing complex linguistic features, handling polyphonic expressions, and producing natural-sounding multilingual speech - capabilities that are crucial for future AI applications. In this paper, we present Fish-Speech, a novel framework that implements a serial fast-slow Dual Autoregressive (Dual-AR) architecture to enhance the stability of Grouped Finite Scalar Vector Quantization (GFSQ) in sequence generation tasks. This architecture improves codebook processing efficiency while maintaining high-fidelity outputs, making it particularly effective for AI interactions and voice cloning.
  Fish-Speech leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for linguistic feature extraction, eliminating the need for traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion and thereby streamlining the synthesis pipeline and enhancing multilingual support. Additionally, we developed FF-GAN through GFSQ to achieve superior compression ratios and near 100\% codebook utilization.
  Our approach addresses key limitations of current TTS systems while providing a foundation for more sophisticated, context-aware speech synthesis. Experimental results show that Fish-Speech significantly outperforms baseline models in handling complex linguistic scenarios and voice cloning tasks, demonstrating its potential to advance TTS technology in AI applications. The implementation is open source at \href{https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech}{https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing is one of the most cherished forms of human entertainment. However, creating a beautiful song requires an accompaniment that complements the vocals and aligns well with the song instruments and genre. With advancements in deep learning, previous research has focused on generating suitable accompaniments but often lacks precise alignment with the desired instrumentation and genre. To address this, we propose a straightforward method that enables control over the accompaniment through text prompts, allowing the generation of music that complements the vocals and aligns with the song instrumental and genre requirements. Through extensive experiments, we successfully generate 10-second accompaniments using vocal input and text control.</description>

      <title>SPES: Spectrogram Perturbation for Explainable Speech-to-Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spurred by the demand for interpretable models, research on eXplainable AI for language technologies has experienced significant growth, with feature attribution methods emerging as a cornerstone of this progress. While prior work in NLP explored such methods for classification tasks and textual applications, explainability intersecting generation and speech is lagging, with existing techniques failing to account for the autoregressive nature of state-of-the-art models and to provide fine-grained, phonetically meaningful explanations. We address this gap by introducing Spectrogram Perturbation for Explainable Speech-to-text Generation (SPES), a feature attribution technique applicable to sequence generation tasks with autoregressive models. SPES provides explanations for each predicted token based on both the input spectrogram and the previously generated tokens. Extensive evaluation on speech recognition and translation demonstrates that SPES generates explanations that are faithful and plausible to humans.</description>

      <title>MoMu-Diffusion: On Learning Long-Term Motion-Music Synchronization and Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion-to-music and music-to-motion have been studied separately, each attracting substantial research interest within their respective domains. The interaction between human motion and music is a reflection of advanced human intelligence, and establishing a unified relationship between them is particularly important. However, to date, there has been no work that considers them jointly to explore the modality alignment within. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework, termed MoMu-Diffusion, for long-term and synchronous motion-music generation. Firstly, to mitigate the huge computational costs raised by long sequences, we propose a novel Bidirectional Contrastive Rhythmic Variational Auto-Encoder (BiCoR-VAE) that extracts the modality-aligned latent representations for both motion and music inputs. Subsequently, leveraging the aligned latent spaces, we introduce a multi-modal Transformer-based diffusion model and a cross-guidance sampling strategy to enable various generation tasks, including cross-modal, multi-modal, and variable-length generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMu-Diffusion surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, and can synthesize realistic, diverse, long-term, and beat-matched music or motion sequences. The generated samples and codes are available at https://momu-diffusion.github.io/</description>

      <title>Align-SLM: Textless Spoken Language Models with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While textless Spoken Language Models (SLMs) have shown potential in end-to-end speech-to-speech modeling, they still lag behind text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of semantic coherence and relevance. This work introduces the Align-SLM framework, which leverages preference optimization inspired by Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) to enhance the semantic understanding of SLMs. Our approach generates multiple speech continuations from a given prompt and uses semantic metrics to create preference data for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We evaluate the framework using ZeroSpeech 2021 benchmarks for lexical and syntactic modeling, the spoken version of the StoryCloze dataset for semantic coherence, and other speech generation metrics, including the GPT4-o score and human evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for SLMs on most benchmarks, highlighting the importance of preference optimization to improve the semantics of SLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transform the timbre of a source speaker into any previously unseen target speaker, while preserving the original linguistic content. Despite notable progress, attaining a degree of speaker similarity and naturalness on par with ground truth recordings continues to pose great challenge. In this paper, we propose CTEFM-VC, a zero-shot VC framework that leverages Content-aware Timbre Ensemble modeling and Flow Matching. Specifically, CTEFM-VC disentangles utterances into linguistic content and timbre representations, subsequently utilizing a conditional flow matching model and a vocoder to reconstruct the mel-spectrogram and waveform. To enhance its timbre modeling capability and the naturalness of generated speech, we propose a context-aware timbre ensemble modeling approach that adaptively integrates diverse speaker verification embeddings and enables the joint utilization of linguistic and timbre features through a cross-attention module. Experiments show that our CTEFM-VC system surpasses state-of-the-art VC methods in both speaker similarity and naturalness by at least 18.5% and 7.0%.</description>

      <title>Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used method for converting continuous representations into discrete codes, which has become fundamental in unsupervised representation learning and latent generative models. However, VQ models are often hindered by the problem of representation collapse in the latent space, which leads to low codebook utilization and limits the scalability of the codebook for large-scale training. Existing methods designed to mitigate representation collapse typically reduce the dimensionality of latent space at the expense of model capacity, which do not fully resolve the core issue. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of representation collapse in VQ models and identify its primary cause as the disjoint optimization of the codebook, where only a small subset of code vectors are updated through gradient descent. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{SimVQ}, a novel method which reparameterizes the code vectors through a linear transformation layer based on a learnable latent basis. This transformation optimizes the \textit{entire linear space} spanned by the codebook, rather than merely updating \textit{the code vector} selected by the nearest-neighbor search in vanilla VQ models. Although it is commonly understood that the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, our approach works surprisingly well in resolving the collapse issue in VQ models with just one linear layer. We validate the efficacy of SimVQ through extensive experiments across various modalities, including image and audio data with different model architectures.

      <title>3D Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

      <title>AV2Wav: Diffusion-Based Re-synthesis from Continuous Self-supervised Features for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08030v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement systems are typically trained using pairs of clean and noisy speech. In audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE), there is not as much ground-truth clean data available; most audio-visual datasets are collected in real-world environments with background noise and reverberation, hampering the development of AVSE. In this work, we introduce AV2Wav, a resynthesis-based audio-visual speech enhancement approach that can generate clean speech despite the challenges of real-world training data. We obtain a subset of nearly clean speech from an audio-visual corpus using a neural quality estimator, and then train a diffusion model on this subset to generate waveforms conditioned on continuous speech representations from AV-HuBERT with noise-robust training. We use continuous rather than discrete representations to retain prosody and speaker information. With this vocoding task alone, the model can perform speech enhancement better than a masking-based baseline. We further fine-tune the diffusion model on clean/noisy utterance pairs to improve the performance. Our approach outperforms a masking-based baseline in terms of both automatic metrics and a human listening test and is close in quality to the target speech in the listening test.

      <title>CLAPSep: Leveraging Contrastive Pre-trained Model for Multi-Modal Query-Conditioned Target Sound Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17455v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal sound separation (USS) aims to extract arbitrary types of sounds from real-world recordings. This can be achieved by language-queried target sound extraction (TSE), which typically consists of two components: a query network that converts user queries into conditional embeddings, and a separation network that extracts the target sound accordingly. Existing methods commonly train models from scratch. As a consequence, substantial data and computational resources are required to make the randomly initialized model comprehend sound events and perform separation accordingly. In this paper, we propose to integrate pre-trained models into TSE models to address the above issue. To be specific, we tailor and adapt the powerful contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP) for USS, denoted as CLAPSep. CLAPSep also accepts flexible user inputs, taking both positive and negative user prompts of uni- and/or multi-modalities for target sound extraction. These key features of CLAPSep can not only enhance the extraction performance but also improve the versatility of its application. We provide extensive experiments on 5 diverse datasets to demonstrate the superior performance and zero- and few-shot generalizability of our proposed CLAPSep with fast training convergence, surpassing previous methods by a significant margin. Full codes and some audio examples are released for reproduction and evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker individuality information is among the most critical elements within speech signals. By thoroughly and accurately modeling this information, it can be utilized in various intelligent speech applications, such as speaker recognition, speaker diarization, speech synthesis, and target speaker extraction. In this overview, we present a comprehensive review of neural approaches to speaker representation learning from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Theoretically, we discuss speaker encoders ranging from supervised to self-supervised learning algorithms, standalone models to large pretrained models, pure speaker embedding learning to joint optimization with downstream tasks, and efforts toward interpretability. Practically, we systematically examine approaches for robustness and effectiveness, introduce and compare various open-source toolkits in the field. Through the systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature, research activities, and resources, we provide a clear reference for researchers in the speaker characterization and modeling field, as well as for those who wish to apply speaker modeling techniques to specific downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Self-Supervised Models for Automatic Whispered Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In automatic speech recognition, any factor that alters the acoustic properties of speech can pose a challenge to the system's performance. This paper presents a novel approach for automatic whispered speech recognition in the Irish dialect using the self-supervised WavLM model. Conventional automatic speech recognition systems often fail to accurately recognise whispered speech due to its distinct acoustic properties and the scarcity of relevant training data. To address this challenge, we utilized a pre-trained WavLM model, fine-tuned with a combination of whispered and normal speech data from the wTIMIT and CHAINS datasets, which include the English language in Singaporean and Irish dialects, respectively. Our baseline evaluation with the OpenAI Whisper model highlighted its limitations, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 18.8% and a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.24% on whispered speech. In contrast, the proposed WavLM-based system significantly improved performance, achieving a WER of 9.22% and a CER of 2.59%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in recognising whispered speech and underscore the importance of tailored acoustic modeling for robust automatic speech recognition systems. This study provides valuable insights into developing effective automatic speech recognition solutions for challenging speech affected by whisper and dialect.

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Modality Fusion Approaches for Audio-Visual Person Identification and Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal learning involves integrating information from various modalities to enhance learning and comprehension. We compare three modality fusion strategies in person identification and verification by processing two modalities: voice and face. In this paper, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed for x-vector extraction from voice, while the pre-trained VGGFace2 network and transfer learning are utilized for face modality. In addition, gammatonegram is used as speech representation in engagement with the Darknet19 pre-trained network. The proposed systems are evaluated using the K-fold cross-validation technique on the 118 speakers of the test set of the VoxCeleb2 dataset. The comparative evaluations are done for single-modality and three proposed multimodal strategies in equal situations. Results demonstrate that the feature fusion strategy of gammatonegram and facial features achieves the highest performance, with an accuracy of 98.37% in the person identification task. However, concatenating facial features with the x-vector reaches 0.62% for EER in verification tasks.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal schizophrenia assessment systems have gained traction over the last few years. This work introduces a schizophrenia assessment system to discern between prominent symptom classes of schizophrenia and predict an overall schizophrenia severity score. We develop a Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) based Multimodal Representation Learning (MRL) model to produce task-agnostic speech representations from vocal Tract Variables (TVs) and Facial Action Units (FAUs). These representations are then used in a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based downstream prediction model to obtain class labels and an overall severity score. The proposed framework outperforms the previous works on the multi-class classification task across all evaluation metrics (Weighted F1 score, AUC-ROC score, and Weighted Accuracy). Additionally, it estimates the schizophrenia severity score, a task not addressed by earlier approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Contextual Speech Recognition Using Vector Quantization for Efficient Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural contextual biasing allows speech recognition models to leverage contextually relevant information, leading to improved transcription accuracy. However, the biasing mechanism is typically based on a cross-attention module between the audio and a catalogue of biasing entries, which means computational complexity can pose severe practical limitations on the size of the biasing catalogue and consequently on accuracy improvements. This work proposes an approximation to cross-attention scoring based on vector quantization and enables compute- and memory-efficient use of large biasing catalogues. We propose to use this technique jointly with a retrieval based contextual biasing approach. First, we use an efficient quantized retrieval module to shortlist biasing entries by grounding them on audio. Then we use retrieved entries for biasing. Since the proposed approach is agnostic to the biasing method, we investigate using full cross-attention, LLM prompting, and a combination of the two. We show that retrieval based shortlisting allows the system to efficiently leverage biasing catalogues of several thousands of entries, resulting in up to 71% relative error rate reduction in personal entity recognition. At the same time, the proposed approximation algorithm reduces compute time by 20% and memory usage by 85-95%, for lists of up to one million entries, when compared to standard dot-product cross-attention.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for End-to-end Code-switching Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training a code-switching end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model normally requires a large amount of data, while code-switching data is often limited. In this paper, three novel approaches are proposed for code-switching data augmentation. Specifically, they are audio splicing with the existing code-switching data, and TTS with new code-switching texts generated by word translation or word insertion. Our experiments on 200 hours Mandarin-English code-switching dataset show that all the three proposed approaches yield significant improvements on code-switching ASR individually. Moreover, all the proposed approaches can be combined with recent popular SpecAugment, and an addition gain can be obtained. WER is significantly reduced by relative 24.0% compared to the system without any data augmentation, and still relative 13.0% gain compared to the system with only SpecAugment</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models; however, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding. The dataset and code will soon be released on https://github.com/ruohaoguo/avis.</description>

      <title>Acousto-optic reconstruction of exterior sound field based on concentric circle sampling with circular harmonic expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optic sensing provides an alternative approach to traditional microphone arrays by shedding light on the interaction of light with an acoustic field. Sound field reconstruction is a fascinating and advanced technique used in acousto-optics sensing. Current challenges in sound-field reconstruction methods pertain to scenarios in which the sound source is located within the reconstruction area, known as the exterior problem. Existing reconstruction algorithms, primarily designed for interior scenarios, often exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to exterior cases. This paper introduces a novel technique for exterior sound-field reconstruction. The proposed method leverages concentric circle sampling and a two-dimensional exterior sound-field reconstruction approach based on circular harmonic extensions. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, both numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted. The results highlight the superior accuracy of the proposed method when compared to conventional reconstruction methods, all while utilizing a minimal amount of measured projection data.</description>

      <title>MLAAD: The Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09512v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology offers notable benefits, such as providing a voice for individuals with speech impairments, but it also facilitates the creation of audio deepfakes and spoofing attacks. AI-based detection methods can help mitigate these risks; however, the performance of such models is inherently dependent on the quality and diversity of their training data. Presently, the available datasets are heavily skewed towards English and Chinese audio, which limits the global applicability of these anti-spoofing systems. To address this limitation, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoof Dataset (MLAAD), created using 82 TTS models, comprising 33 different architectures, to generate 378.0 hours of synthetic voice in 38 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD and observe that it demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild and Fake- OrReal when used as a training resource. Moreover, compared to the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, each excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD and making a trained model accessible via an interactive webserver, we aim to democratize anti-spoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of specialists, and contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and deepfakes.</description>

      <title>ManiWAV: Learning Robot Manipulation from In-the-Wild Audio-Visual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio signals provide rich information for the robot interaction and object properties through contact. This information can surprisingly ease the learning of contact-rich robot manipulation skills, especially when the visual information alone is ambiguous or incomplete. However, the usage of audio data in robot manipulation has been constrained to teleoperated demonstrations collected by either attaching a microphone to the robot or object, which significantly limits its usage in robot learning pipelines. In this work, we introduce ManiWAV: an 'ear-in-hand' data collection device to collect in-the-wild human demonstrations with synchronous audio and visual feedback, and a corresponding policy interface to learn robot manipulation policy directly from the demonstrations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system through four contact-rich manipulation tasks that require either passively sensing the contact events and modes, or actively sensing the object surface materials and states. In addition, we show that our system can generalize to unseen in-the-wild environments by learning from diverse in-the-wild human demonstrations.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Synthetic Audio Conversations Generation using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ConversaSynth, a framework designed to generate synthetic conversation audio using large language models (LLMs) with multiple persona settings. The framework first creates diverse and coherent text-based dialogues across various topics, which are then converted into audio using text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that ConversaSynth effectively generates highquality synthetic audio datasets, which can significantly enhance the training and evaluation of models for audio tagging, audio classification, and multi-speaker speech recognition. The results indicate that the synthetic datasets generated by ConversaSynth exhibit substantial diversity and realism, making them suitable for developing robust, adaptable audio-based AI systems.</description>

      <title>WER We Stand: Benchmarking Urdu ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Urdu Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. We analyze the performance of three ASR model families: Whisper, MMS, and Seamless-M4T using Word Error Rate (WER), along with a detailed examination of the most frequent wrong words and error types including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Our analysis is conducted using two types of datasets, read speech and conversational speech. Notably, we present the first conversational speech dataset designed for benchmarking Urdu ASR models. We find that seamless-large outperforms other ASR models on the read speech dataset, while whisper-large performs best on the conversational speech dataset. Furthermore, this evaluation highlights the complexities of assessing ASR models for low-resource languages like Urdu using quantitative metrics alone and emphasizes the need for a robust Urdu text normalization system. Our findings contribute valuable insights for developing robust ASR systems for low-resource languages like Urdu.</description>

      <title>Preference Tuning with Human Feedback on Language, Speech, and Vision Tasks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference tuning is a crucial process for aligning deep generative models with human preferences. This survey offers a thorough overview of recent advancements in preference tuning and the integration of human feedback. The paper is organized into three main sections: 1) introduction and preliminaries: an introduction to reinforcement learning frameworks, preference tuning tasks, models, and datasets across various modalities: language, speech, and vision, as well as different policy approaches, 2) in-depth exploration of each preference tuning approach: a detailed analysis of the methods used in preference tuning, and 3) applications, discussion, and future directions: an exploration of the applications of preference tuning in downstream tasks, including evaluation methods for different modalities, and an outlook on future research directions. Our objective is to present the latest methodologies in preference tuning and model alignment, enhancing the understanding of this field for researchers and practitioners. We hope to encourage further engagement and innovation in this area.</description>

      <title>Gibberish is All You Need for Membership Inference Detection in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio can disclose PII, particularly when combined with related text data. Therefore, it is essential to develop tools to detect privacy leakage in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining(CLAP). Existing MIAs need audio as input, risking exposure of voiceprint and requiring costly shadow models. We first propose PRMID, a membership inference detector based probability ranking given by CLAP, which does not require training shadow models but still requires both audio and text of the individual as input. To address these limitations, we then propose USMID, a textual unimodal speaker-level membership inference detector, querying the target model using only text data. We randomly generate textual gibberish that are clearly not in training dataset. Then we extract feature vectors from these texts using the CLAP model and train a set of anomaly detectors on them. During inference, the feature vector of each test text is input into the anomaly detector to determine if the speaker is in the training set (anomalous) or not (normal). If available, USMID can further enhance detection by integrating real audio of the tested speaker. Extensive experiments on various CLAP model architectures and datasets demonstrate that USMID outperforms baseline methods using only text data.</description>

      <title>emg2qwerty: A Large Dataset with Baselines for Touch Typing using Surface Electromyography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) non-invasively measures signals generated by muscle activity with sufficient sensitivity to detect individual spinal neurons and richness to identify dozens of gestures and their nuances. Wearable wrist-based sEMG sensors have the potential to offer low friction, subtle, information rich, always available human-computer inputs. To this end, we introduce emg2qwerty, a large-scale dataset of non-invasive electromyographic signals recorded at the wrists while touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard, together with ground-truth annotations and reproducible baselines. With 1,135 sessions spanning 108 users and 346 hours of recording, this is the largest such public dataset to date. These data demonstrate non-trivial, but well defined hierarchical relationships both in terms of the generative process, from neurons to muscles and muscle combinations, as well as in terms of domain shift across users and user sessions. Applying standard modeling techniques from the closely related field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), we show strong baseline performance on predicting key-presses using sEMG signals alone. We believe the richness of this task and dataset will facilitate progress in several problems of interest to both the machine learning and neuroscientific communities. Dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/facebookresearch/emg2qwerty.</description>
