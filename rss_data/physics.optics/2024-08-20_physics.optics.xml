      <title>Composite solitary vortices of three-wave mixing in quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the composite vortex solitons of three-wave mixing propagate stably in a three-dimensional (3D) quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals (QPM-PhC). The modulation of QPM-PhC is designed as a checkerboard pattern. The vortex solitons, composed by three waves ($\omega_{1,2,3}$) propagating through the lattices, exhibit a four-spotted discrete type, which gives rise to four distinct modes: zero-vorticity, vortex, anti-vortex, and quadrupole. The composite vortex solitons result from combinations of these modes and lead to four cases: vortex doubling, hidden vortices, vortex up-conversion, and anti-vortex up-conversion. Our findings indicate that all solitons can propagate stably through the crystals for 10 centimeters; however, only the vortex-doubling case remains stable over longer distances. This work enhances the understanding of vortex beam manipulation within 3D QPM-PhCs.</description>

      <title>Automatic Mitigation of Dynamic Atmospheric Turbulence Using Optical Phase Conjugation for Coherent Free-Space Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent detection can provide enhanced receiver sensitivity and spectral efficiency in free-space optical (FSO) communications. However, turbulence can cause modal power coupling effects on a Gaussian data beam and significantly degrade the mixing efficiency between the data beam and a Gaussian local oscillator (LO) in the coherent detector. Optical phase conjugation (OPC) in a photorefractive crystal can "automatically" mitigate turbulence by: (a) recording a back-propagated turbulence-distorted probe beam, and (b) creating a phase-conjugate beam that has the inverse phase distortion of the medium as the transmitted data beam. However, previously reported crystal-based OPC approaches for FSO links have demonstrated either: (i) a relatively fast response time of 35 ms but at a relatively low data rate (e.g., &lt;1 Mbit/s), or (ii) a relatively high data rate of 2-Gbit/s but at a slow response time (e.g., &gt;60 s). Here, we report an OPC approach for the automatic mitigation of dynamic turbulence that enables both a high data rate (8 Gbit/s) data beam and a rapid (&lt;5 ms) response time. For a similar data rate, this represents a 10,000-fold faster response time than previous reports, thereby enabling mitigation for dynamic effects. In our approach, the transmitted pre-distorted phase-conjugate data beam is generated by four-wave mixing in a GaAs crystal of three input beams: a turbulence-distorted probe beam, a Gaussian reference beam regenerated from the probe beam, and a Gaussian data beam carrying a high-speed data channel. We experimentally demonstrate our approach in an 8-Gbit/s quadrature-phase-shift-keying coherent FSO link through emulated dynamic turbulence. Our results show ~10-dB improvement in the mixing efficiency of the LO with the data beam under dynamic turbulence with a bandwidth of up to ~260 Hz (Greenwood frequency).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics and chaos in dissipative optical trimers with complex couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of non-Hermitian photonics, we consider a nonlinear optical trimer with three lossy waveguides with complex couplings. This non-Hermitian trimer exhibits stable stationary and oscillatory regimes in a wide range of values of the coupling-loss parameters. Moreover, chaotic dynamics through period-doubling is confirmed via Lyapunov exponent measurements and the underlying bifurcation structure is found by semi-analytical continuation of solutions. The interplay of chaos, due to Kerr nonlinearity, and non-Hermiticity, due to the combined dissipation and complex coupling, provides a different perspective in the area of nonlinear and non-Hermitian optics.</description>

      <title>Lasing on hybridized soliton frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling is an essential mechanism that drives complexity in natural systems, transforming single, non-interacting elements into intricate networks with rich physical properties. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale coupled laser system that exhibits complex optical states impossible to achieve in an uncoupled system. We show that a pair of coupled semiconductor ring lasers spontaneously forms a frequency comb consisting of the hybridized modes of its coupled cavity, exhibiting a large number of phase-locked tones that anticross with one another. Experimental coherent waveform reconstruction reveals that the hybridized frequency comb manifests itself as pairs of bright and dark picosecond-long solitons circulating simultaneously. The dark and bright solitons exit the coupled cavity at the same time, leading to breathing bright solitons temporally overlapped with their dark soliton counterparts - a state inaccessible for a single, free-running laser. Our results demonstrate that the rules that govern allowable states of light can be broken by simply coupling elements together, paving the way for the design of more complex networks of coupled on-chip lasers.</description>

      <title>Optical Two-Tone Time Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-picosecond timing synchronization can enable future optical timekeeping networks, including coherent phased array radar imaging at GHz levels, intercontinental clock comparisons for the redefinition of the second, chronometric leveling, and synchronization of remote assets, including future satellite-based optical time standards. With optical clocks now operating on mobile platforms, free-space synchronization networks with compatible performance and the ability to operate under platform motion are essential to expand the reach of precision timing. Recently, femtosecond (fs)-level optical time-transfer techniques have been developed that can operate over hundreds of kilometers despite atmospheric turbulence, signal fade, and dropouts. Here we report a two-tone optical time transfer scheme with comparable performance that reduces hardware requirements and can support both fiber and free-space networks. Using this technique, sub-fs synchronization was demonstrated over a $\sim$100 m free-space link for several hours. In addition, the link was used to syntonize two iodine optical clocks and then compare them over four days. The set-up employs an integrated photonics transceiver and telecom-band lasers that are compatible with full photonic integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical two-way time and frequency transfer is an enabling technology that has applications ranging from fundamental investigations of relativity to the operation of global navigation satellite systems. While fiber frequency combs have demonstrated the most stable optical links, they are not ideal for applications that require very low SWaP-C. Here, we demonstrate two-way time and frequency transfer using electro-optic combs that have a direct path to full chip-scale integration. This two-way electro-optic time and frequency transfer system demonstrated instabilities as low as 15 fs at 1 s of averaging time. These results show a pathway to highly stable, agile and low SWaP-C time transfer networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinct selectivity to the spin angular momenta of photons have garnered significant attention in recent years, for their relevance in basic science and for imaging and sensing applications. While nonlocal metasurfaces with strong chiral responses to the incident light have been reported, these responses are typically limited to a narrow range of incident angles. In this study, we demonstrate a nonlocal metasurface that showcases strong chirality, characterized by circular dichroism larger than 0.6, over a wide range of incident angles $\pm5^o$. Its quality factor, circular dichroism and resonant frequency can be optimized by design. These findings pave the way to further advance the development of valley-selective optical cavities and augmented reality applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. However, recent advancements in nanofabrication capabilities and design opportunities have led to the recognition of the advantages of incorporating disorder for specific optical functionalities. This review provides an overview of the principal theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects concerning the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field.</description>

      <title>High-Capacity Metasurface at Limits of Polarization and Wavelength Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization and wavelength multiplexing are the two most widely employed techniques to improve the capacity in the metasurfaces. Existing works have pushed each technique to its individual limits. For example, the polarization multiplexing channels working at a single wavelength have been significantly increased by using noise engineering. However, it is still challenging to achieve the multiplexing limits of wavelength and polarization simultaneously. Besides, such multiplexing methods suffer from computational inefficiencies, hindering their application in tasks like image recognition that require extensive training computation. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using deep neural network (DNN) to achieve the limits of both polarization and wavelength multiplexing with high computational efficiency. We experimentally demonstrate this capability, achieving a record-breaking capacity of 15 holographic images across five wavelengths and the maximum of three independent polarization channels, as well as 18 holographic images across three wavelengths and six corelated polarization channels. Moreover, leveraging the high computational efficiency of our DNN-based method, which is well-suited for processing large datasets, we implement large-scale image recognition tasks across 36 classes encoded in a record of nine multiplexed channels (three wavelengths * three polarizations), achieving 96% classification accuracy in calculations and 91.5% in experiments. This work sets a new benchmark for high-capacity multiplexing with metasurfaces and demonstrates the power of gradient-based inverse design for realizing multi-functional optical elements.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Based Full-Parameter Optical Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical multiplexing is a key technique that enhances the capacity of optical systems by independently modulating various optical parameters to carry distinct information. Among these parameters, wavelength, polarization, and angle are the primary ones for multiplexing in plane waves with uniform cross-sectional distribution. While metasurfaces have recently emerged as a powerful platform for optical multiplexing, they are typically restricted to partial parameter multiplexing and exhibit a low number of multiplexing channels. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the full-parameter multiplexing of polarization, wavelength, and angle, achieving hundreds of distinct multiplexing channels,the largest reported to date. Our design utilizes a gradient-based optimization algorithm to enable high-efficiency performance and independent functionalities with minimal cross-talk among channels. This approach represents a significant advancement in metasurface design and optical multiplexing, with potential applications in complex and dynamic optical systems.</description>

      <title>3D-printed terahertz subwavelength dual-core fibers with dense channel-integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) fiber that provides high-speed connections is an essential component in THz communication systems. The emerging space-division-multiplexing technology is expected to increase the transmission capacity of THz communications. A promising candidate to achieve that is integrating multiple channels in a compact THz multi-core fiber system. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a THz subwavelength rectangular dielectric dual-core fiber structure, where two identical cores can be densely integrated, thanks to the polarization-maintaining feature of the rectangular fiber. Different configurations, including the placements, core-spacings, and polarization states of two fiber cores, are comprehensively investigated to improve channel isolation. Numerical simulations show that the fractional power in core of fiber mode has a dominant effect on inter-core coupling performance. Moreover, we design the core size (1 mm x 0.5 mm) slightly less than the WR5.1 waveguide (1.295 mm x 0.6475 mm) so that the fiber can be conveniently connected with the WR5.1 flange port with mode excitation efficiencies up to 62.8%. A cost-efficient dielectric 3D printing technique is employed for rapid fabrications of dual-core fibers and corresponding polymer flange structures that offer solid integration between the fiber samples and the WR5.1 port. Experimental measurements demonstrate that a 4-mm core-spacing (less than three times the operation wavelengths over 0.17-0.21 THz) supports robust dual-channel propagation with channel isolation values more than 15 dB, which are consistent with theoretical and numerical results. This work provides a densely integrated dual-core fiber system with low fabrication cost and practical connection to the WR5.1 flange, holding exciting potential for high-capacity THz space-division-multiplexing communication systems.</description>

      <title>Towards the Information-Theoretic Limit of Programmable Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of many programmable photonic circuits is limited by the $2\pi$ tuning range needed for the constituent phase shifters. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of a phase-efficient circuit architecture, where the average phase shift is $\ll 2\pi$. We derive a universal information-theoretic limit to the phase-shift efficiency of universal multiport interferometers, and propose a "3-MZI" architecture that approaches this limit to within a factor of $2\times$, approximately a $10\times$ reduction in average phase shift over the prior art, where the average phase shift scales inversely with system size as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$. For non-unitary circuits, we show that the 3-MZI saturates the theoretical bound for Gaussian-distributed target matrices. Using this architecture, we show optical neural network training with all phase shifters constrained to $\lesssim 0.2$ radians without loss of accuracy.</description>

      <title>0ptical trapping with optical magnetic field and photonic Hall effect forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical trapping is having ever-increasing impact in science $-$ particularly biophysics, photonics and most recently in quantum optomechanics $-$ owing to its superior capability for manipulating nanoscale structures and materials. However, essentially all experimental optical trapping studies in the optical dipole regime have, to date, been dominated by the interaction between a material's electric polarizability, $\alpha_{e}$, and the electric part of the incident electromagnetic field, and therefore described by electric field intensity gradient forces. Optical trapping based on optical magnetic light-matter interactions has not been experimentally addressed despite it's immediate extension of the boundaries of optical trapping research and applications. This paper addresses this long-standing deficiency through the realization of optical magnetic trapping of large index of refraction (i.e., Si) nanoparticles and also presents a formalism for quantitative understanding of the experimental findings. Our experimental optical trapping results require including optical magnetic polarizability, $\alpha_{m}$, and electric-magnetic scattering forces associated with the Photonic Hall effect that are qualitatively and quantitatively validated by Maxwell stress tensor calculations. Our findings bring new opportunities for nanoparticle manipulation, potentially relax the limitations Ashkin claimed based on the optical Earnshaw's theorem, motivate optical matter formation by optical magnetic interactions, and suggest new N-body effects and symmetry breaking to drive dynamics of optical matter systems.</description>

      <title>Extension of Babinet's relations to reflective metasurfaces: Application to the simultaneous control of wavefront and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Babinet's relations, which are originally derived for transmissive metasurfaces, to reflective metasurfaces embedding planar metallic structures in a substrate containing a reflection mirror. To verify the extended Babinet's relations, we investigate two types of reflective metasurfaces embedding self-complementary structures, which produce $\pi$-phase difference between two orthogonal linear polarizations under specific conditions required for the extended Babinet's relations. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate a metasurface-based half-wave plate with a reflective metasurface including single self-complementary structures in the terahertz regions. In addition, we study a reflective metasurface with embedded self-complementary structures with phase gradient in reflection, and demonstrate simultaneous implementation of anomalous reflection and polarization conversion with high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sputtered Aluminum Nitride Waveguides for the Telecommunication Spectrum with less than 0.16 dB/cm Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of photonic waveguides from sputtered aluminum nitride (AlN). The AlN films were deposited on 6" silicon substrates with a 3 $\mu$m buried silicon oxide layer using reactive DC magnetron sputtering at a temperature of 700{\deg}C. The resulting uncladded polycrystalline waveguides exhibit propagation losses of 0.137 $\pm$ 0.005 dB/cm at wavelengths of 1310 nm and 0.154 $\pm$ 0.008 dB/cm at a wavelength of 1550 nm in the TE polarization. These results are the best reported for sputtered AlN waveguides in the C-band and the first report in the O-band. These performances are comparable to those of the best-reported AlN waveguides, which are epitaxially grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on sapphire substrates. Our findings highlight the potential of sputtered AlN for photonic platforms working in the telecom spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Development of methods to control the directional and spectral characteristics of thermal radiation from metallic surfaces is a critical factor enabling many important thermal management applications. In this paper, we study the thermal emission properties of functionalized aluminum surfaces produced through femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP). These types of surfaces have recently been found to exhibit near-unity broadband omnidirectional emissivity. However, their ultrabroadband absorption response includes visible and near-infrared (IR) radiation, in addition to the mid-IR range, which limits their use as daytime passive radiative cooling devices. Here, we present ways to solve this problem by demonstrating a new design that uses a dielectric Bragg visible light reflector to accurately control the thermal emission spectra of the FLSP surface with the goal of achieving high performance daytime radiative cooling operation. In addition, we propose other designs based on dielectric multilayer structures to further tailor and control the spectra and thermal emission angles of the FLSP surfaces leading to narrowband and broadband directional thermal radiation. The presented photonic engineering approach combined with FLSP structures will be beneficial to various emerging applications, such as radiative cooling, thermal sensing, and thermophotovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband Coherent Perfect Absorption with Composite Graphene Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the design and performance of a new multilayer graphene metasurface for achieving ultrabroadband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) in the THz regime. The proposed structure comprises of three graphene patterned metasurfaces separated by thin dielectric spacer layers. The top and bottom metasurfaces have cross shape unit cells with varying sizes, while the middle graphene metasurface is square-shaped. This distinctive geometrical asymmetry and the presence of multiple layers within the structure facilitate the achievement of wideband asymmetric reflection under incoherent illumination. This interesting property serves as a crucial step towards achieving near-total absorption under coherent illumination across a broad frequency range. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the absorption efficiency surpasses 90% across an ultrabroadband frequency range from 2.8 to 5.7 THz, i.e., bandwidth of 2.9 THz. The CPA effect can be selectively tuned by manipulating the phase difference between the two incident coherent beams. Moreover, the absorption response can be dynamically adjusted by altering the Fermi level of graphene. The study also examines the influence of geometric parameters on the absorption characteristics. The results of this research work offer valuable insights into the design of broadband graphene metasurfaces for coherent absorption applications, and they contribute to the advancement of sophisticated optical devices operating in the THz frequency range.</description>

      <title>Conversion of linearly polarized high-harmonic radiation into the circularly polarized in an optically modulated plasma-based X-ray laser: taking into account the nonlinearity and finite width of the harmonic spectral lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method proposed in [I.R. Khairulin et al., JETP Letters 117(9), 652 (2023)] for converting the linearly polarized radiation of high-order harmonics of an optical field into the circularly polarized in an optically modulated active medium of a plasma-based X-ray laser has been de-veloped. This method is extended to the case of finite width of spectral lines (finite pulse dura-tion) of high harmonic radiation and nonlinear interaction of radiation with matter. The trans-formation of the polarization of the harmonic field is achieved by introducing a phase shift of {\pi}/2 between its polarization components, parallel and orthogonal to the polarization of the modulating field, through resonant dispersion on the spectral wings of the induced gain lines of the active medium and is accompanied by an increase in the power of high harmonics. It is shown that for harmonics with a finite bandwidth, the polarization of the output radiation is non-uniform in time. The reasons for such non-uniformity are analyzed and the conditions for its minimization are found. The influence of nonlinearity and amplified spontaneous radiation of the active medium on the high-harmonic polarization is investigated. The possibilities for the experimental implementation of this effect in a neon-like active medium of a plasma X-ray laser based on Ti12+ ions with an unperturbed wavelength of the inverted transition at 32.6 nm are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Edge detection imaging by quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have revolutionized analog computing and image processing at sub-wavelength scales with faster speed and lower power consumption. They typically involve spatial differentiation with engineered angular dispersion. Quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for tailoring properties of optical resonances. While quasi-BICs have been explored in various applications that require high $Q$-factors and enhanced field confinement, their full potential in image processing remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate edge detection imaging by leveraging a quasi-BIC in an all-dielectric metasurface. This metasurface, composed of four nanodisks per unit cell, supports a polarization-independent quasi-BIC through structural perturbations, allowing simultaneously engineering $Q$-factor and angular dispersion. Importantly, we find that with suitable parameters, this quasi-BIC metasurface can perform isotropic two-dimensional spatial differentiation, which is the core element for realizing edge detection. Following the theoretical design, we fabricate the metasurfaces on the silicon-on-insulator platform and experimentally validate their capability of high-quality, efficient, and uniform edge detection imaging under different incident polarizations. Our results illuminate the mechanisms of edge detection with quasi-BIC metasurfaces and highlight new opportunities for their application in ultra-compact, low-power optical computing devices.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Non-Volatile On-Chip Bragg Filter with Multilevel Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) demand tailored spectral responses for various applications. On-chip Bragg filters offer a promising solution, yet their static nature hampers scalability. Current tunable filters rely on volatile switching mechanisms plagued by high static power consumption and thermal crosstalk. Here, we introduce, for the first time, a non-volatile, electrically programmable on-chip Bragg filter. This device incorporates a nanoscale layer of wide-bandgap phase change material (Sb2S3) atop a periodically structured silicon waveguide. The reversible phase transitions and drastic refractive index modulation of Sb2S3 enable dynamic spectral tuning via foundry-compatible microheaters. Our design surpasses traditional passive Bragg gratings and active volatile filters by offering electrically controlled, reconfigurable spectral responses in a non-volatile manner. The proposed filter achieves a peak reflectivity exceeding 99% and a high tuning range ($\Delta\lambda$=20 nm) when transitioning between the amorphous and crystalline states of Sb2S3. Additionally, we demonstrate quasi-continuous spectral control of the filter stopband by modulating the amorphous/crystalline distribution within Sb2S3. Our approach offers substantial benefits for low-power, programmable PICs, thereby laying the groundwork for prospective applications in optical communications, optical interconnects, microwave photonics, optical signal processing, and adaptive multi-parameter sensing.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Edge-based OPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical proximity correction (OPC) is crucial for pushing the boundaries of semiconductor manufacturing and enabling the continued scaling of integrated circuits. While pixel-based OPC, termed as inverse lithography technology (ILT), has gained research interest due to its flexibility and precision. Its complexity and intricate features can lead to challenges in mask writing, increased defects, and higher costs, hence hindering widespread industrial adoption. In this paper, we propose DiffOPC, a differentiable OPC framework that enjoys the virtue of both edge-based OPC and ILT. By employing a mask rule-aware gradient-based optimization approach, DiffOPC efficiently guides mask edge segment movement during mask optimization, minimizing wafer error by propagating true gradients from the cost function back to the mask edges. Our approach achieves lower edge placement error while reducing manufacturing cost by half compared to state-of-the-art OPC techniques, bridging the gap between the high accuracy of pixel-based OPC and the practicality required for industrial adoption, thus offering a promising solution for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Ambient air plasma acceleration in tightly-focused ultrashort infrared laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical results have demonstrated the possibility of accelerating electrons in the MeV range by focusing tightly a few-cycle laser beam in ambient air. Using Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, this configuration is revisited within a more accurate modelling approach to analyze and optimize the mechanism responsible for electron acceleration. In particular, an analytical model for a linearly polarized tightly-focused ultrashort laser field is derived and coupled to a PIC code, allowing us to model the interaction of laser beams reflected by high-numerical aperture mirrors with laser-induced plasmas. A set of 3D PIC simulations is performed where the laser wavelength is varied from 800 nm to 7.0 $\mu$m while the normalized amplitude of the electric field is varied from $a_{0} = 3.6$ to $a_{0} = 7.0$. The preferential forward acceleration of electrons, as well as the analysis of the laser intensity evolution in the plasma and data on electron number density, confirm that the relativistic ponderomotive force is responsible for the acceleration. We also demonstrate that the electron kinetic energy reaches a maximum of $\approx1.6$ MeV when the central wavelength is of 2.5 $\mu$m.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-heavy water (HOD) is one of the simplest molecules in which the bonds are labelled by isotope. We demonstrate that a pair of intense few-femtosecond infrared laser pulses can be used to selectively tunnel ionize along one of the two bonds. The first pulse doubly ionizes HOD, inducing rapid bond stretching and unbending. Femtoseconds later, the second pulse arrives and further ionization is selectively enhanced along the OH bond. These conclusions arise from 3D time-resolved measurements of H$^+$, D$^+$, and O$^+$ momenta following triple ionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings quantum optics model allows us to understand the dialogue between light and matter at its most fundamental level, which is crucial for advancements in quantum science and technology. Several generalizations of the model have long been proposed, emphasizing their dynamic behavior but paying less attention to their spectroscopy. Here, we obtain analytical expressions of the time-dependent spectral response of a nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model based on deformed field operators. We show that the long-time response of the resulting nonlinear cavity field resembles the one experimentally obtained in the strong-dispersive regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. The spectrum is intrinsically asymmetric with the nonlinear coupling, a signature of the impossibility of getting resonant conditions for finite field excitations.</description>

      <title>Practical security of twin-field quantum key distribution under wavelength-switching attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The twin-field class quantum key distribution (TF-class QKD) has experimentally demonstrated the ability to surpass the fundamental rate-distance limit without requiring a quantum repeater, as a revolutional milestone. In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Moreover, we have shown that with well calibration of the modulators, the attack can be eliminated. Through this study, we highlight the importance of system calibration in the practical security in TF-class QKD implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light is a particularly useful quantum resource, which finds broad applications in quantum information processing, quantum metrology and sensing, and biological measurements. It has been successfully generated in various physical systems. Here we introduce a new mechanism and system to produce squeezed light using an exciton-phonon cavity-QED system. Specifically, we adopt a semiconductor microcavity embedded with a quantum well, which supports both linear and nonlinear interactions among excitons, phonons, and cavity photons. We show that the strong exciton-phonon nonlinear interaction can induce a quadrature-squeezed cavity output field, and reveal an important role of the exciton-photon coupling in engineering the squeezing spectrum and improving the robustness of the squeezing against thermal noise. Our results indicate that room-temperature squeezing of light is possible for materials with high exciton binding energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations based on the quantum Langevin equations have been performed for a large number of two-level atoms in a beam interacting with a low-Q cavity with the atomic initial superposition states close to the north pole of the Bloch sphere. When the pump Rabi frequency was modulated at $\Delta_{pa}$ with zero pump-atom detuning for various cavity-atom detunings, we obtained a lasing peak at the atomic resonance and superradiant lasing peaks at $\pm\Delta_{pa}$ simultaneously while the central peak exhibiting a zero frequency pulling coefficient. The linewidth of the central peak was reduced beyond the gain narrowing as the mean number of atoms was increased, resulting in a minimum linewidth as small as a millionth of the atomic or cavity linewdith. A pump carrier detuning caused asymmetric heights for the side superradiant peaks, the height difference of which can be used to lock the pump laser to the atom within the linewidth of the central lasing peak. Our results may lead to development of a new type of ultra-stable active optical clocks for future frequency standards when applied to proper atomic systems.</description>

Abstract: A potential weakness of topological waveguides is that they act on a fixed narrow band of frequencies. However, by 3D printing samples from a photo-responsive polymer, we can obtain a device whose operating frequency can be fine-tuned dynamically using laser excitation.

Abstract: Recent research in light scattering has prompted a re-evaluation of complex quantities, particularly in the context of complex frequency signals, which exhibit exponential growth or decay unlike traditional harmonic signals. We introduce a novel approach using complex frequency signals to reveal hidden or invisible poles--those with predominantly imaginary components--previously undetected in conventional scattering experiments. By employing a carefully tuned complex frequency excitation method, we demonstrate the efficient conversion of non-oscillating fields into oscillating ones. This effect is shown in both RF and optical domains, specifically within the C-band infrared spectral range, which is crucial for communications. This study enhances the theoretical framework of wave interactions in photonic systems, paving the way for innovative applications in invisibility cloaking, advanced photonic devices, and the future of optical communication and quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We propose a quantum memory based on the pre-created long-lived macroscopic quantum coherence. It is shown that the proposed approach provides new physical properties and methods for retrieval of the signal light fields and improvement of the basic parameters of quantum memory. We demonstrate how the pre-created coherence can enable quantum storage with low quantum noise, programmable and on demand retrieval of signal light fields in atomic ensembles with natural inhomogeneous broadening. The feasibility of implementing this proposal in various crystals doped with rare earth ions, as well as in atomic gases with a Raman transition indicates a new way for the development of optical quantum memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzed the optical techniques for high resolution, low-noise spectroscopy of a hyperfine structure (HFS) made of ytterbium-isotope 171 ions ($^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$:$\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$). Large energy spacings in $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ are advantageous for spin-state preparations of quantum memory and construction of a transducer, thereby promoting the simultaneous stable control of the optical frequencies of lasers over a wide range of 3 GHz. We also built our own 2.7-K cryogenic system for optical, radio-wave-assisted spectroscopy. We attained to high resolution and sensitivity both in pump-probe saturation spectroscopy (PPS) and Raman heterodyne spectroscopy (RHS). Our frequency-stabilized PPS achieved a high-resolution spectrum of the HFS, whereas our setup of RHS enabled the efficient detection of paramagnetic spin resonance efficiently for a wide range of radio frequencies. As the underlying Raman process is an up-converting transduction, we present the optimization of the sensitivity of Raman heterodyne detections by selecting the best crystal orientation and efficient radio-wave coupling in future applications toward photon transducers.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond pulse amplification on a chip</title>

Abstract: Femtosecond laser pulses enable the synthesis of light across the electromagnetic spectrum and provide access to ultrafast phenomena in physics, biology, and chemistry. Chip-integration of femtosecond technology could revolutionize applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, bio-medical imaging, portable chemical sensing, or autonomous navigation. However, current chip-integrated pulse sources lack the required peak power and on-chip amplification of femtosecond pulses has been an unresolved challenge. Here, addressing this challenge, we report &gt;50-fold amplification of 1 GHz-repetition-rate chirped femtosecond pulses in a CMOS-compatible photonic chip to 800 W peak power with 116 fs pulse duration. This power level is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher compared to those in previously demonstrated on-chip pulse sources and can provide the power needed to address key applications. To achieve this, detrimental nonlinear effects are mitigated through all-normal dispersion, large mode-area and rare-earth-doped gain waveguides. These results offer a pathway to chip-integrated femtosecond technology with peak power-levels characteristic of table-top sources.</description>

      <title>Evolutions of ring Airy vortex beam and ring Pearcey vortex beam in turbulent atmosphere and a comparative analysis of their channel efficiencies and OAM spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optical vortex beam propagating through turbulent atmosphere encounters distortions in the wavefront that results in modal scattering. Abruptly autofocussing (AAF) beams with orbital angular momentum have gained significant attention due to their non-diffracting and self-healing nature. These warrants understanding of the behaviour of these beams through turbulent atmosphere absolutely necessary. With this intuition, in the present work we investigate the behaviour of two AAF beams namely ring Airy vortex beam (RAVB) and ring Pearcey vortex beam (RPVB) through the turbulent atmosphere in two cases-multiplexed and non-multiplexed. We propagate multiplexed as well as non-multiplexed RAVB and RPVB in different levels of turbulent atmosphere. In non-multiplexed case, channel efficiency declines for both the beams with increase in modes numbers. In multiplexed case, increasing the gap between the mode sets results in decrease in channel efficiency. We also report that in weak atmospheric turbulence RAVB outperform RPVB in terms of channel efficiency. We use optical transformation sorting (log-polar) method to demultiplex the optical beams at the output. Furthermore, we investigate and compare the OAM spectra of both beams in different levels of atmospheric turbulence and at different propagation distances. The comparison reveals that the spectra of RPVB are more dispersive as compared to that of RAVB.</description>

      <title>Space-time non-separable dynamics of ultrashort vortex pulse with power exponential spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrashort optical pulses with orbital angular momentum (OAM) owing to their various applications in classical as well as quantum domains attract a lot of research attention. The evolution of their spatio-temporal dynamics is of particular interest. In the present work, we numerically explore the spatio-temporal evolution of ultrashort Laguerre Gauss (LG) vortex with power exponential (PE) spectrum, also called PE pulse, in dispersive and nonlinear media. We in particular address the evolution of space-time non-separable ultrashort LG vortex. The study reveals tilt and splitting in the spatio-temporal plane. We observe compression at the trailing edge of the pulse with increase in the strength of the nonlinearity. The study further reveals that the temporal, spectral and chirp evolution patterns of the pulse vary uniquely across different spatial regions and these variations depend upon the strength of nonlinearity and propagation distance. In weak nonlinear regime, a redshift in spectrum is noted as we move radially outward from the bright caustic of ultrashort LG vortex while a blue shifted spectrum emerges on approaching towards the phase singularity. Interestingly, as the pulse furthers in the medium, nonlinearity induced spectral shift is witnessed. With stronger nonlinearity, a complex spectral evolution is observed.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Diffraction Tomography using Explicit Neural Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous imaging of fluorescence-labeled and label-free phase objects in the same sample provides distinct and complementary information. Most multimodal fluorescence-phase imaging operates in transmission mode, capturing fluorescence images and phase images separately or sequentially, which limits their practical application in vivo. Here, we develop fluorescence diffraction tomography (FDT) with explicit neural fields to reconstruct the 3D refractive index (RI) of phase objects from diffracted fluorescence images captured in reflection mode. The successful reconstruction of 3D RI using FDT relies on four key components: a coarse-to-fine structure, self-calibration, a differential multi-slice rendering model, and partially coherent masks. The explicit representation integrates with the coarse-to-fine structure for high-speed, high-resolution reconstruction, while the differential multi-slice rendering model enables self-calibration of fluorescence illumination, ensuring accurate forward image prediction and RI reconstruction. Partially coherent masks efficiently resolve discrepancies between the coherent light model and partially coherent light data. FDT successfully reconstructs the RI of 3D cultured label-free bovine myotubes in a 530 $\times$ 530 $\times$ 300 $\mu m^3$ volume at 1024 $\times$ 1024 pixels across 24 $z$-layers from fluorescence images, demonstrating high resolution and high accuracy 3D RI reconstruction of bulky and heterogeneous biological samples in vitro.</description>

      <title>Deep-sub-cycle attosecond optical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-cycle optical pulse is of great importance for ultrafast science and technology. While a narrower pulse can offer a higher temporal resolution, so far the pulse width has not exceeded the limit of half an optical cycle. Here we propose to break the half-cycle limit via inverse Compton scattering in a nano-slit optical mode, in which a deep-subwavelength-confined optical field can be converted into a deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse by high-energy free electrons flying through. Our calculations show that, with experimentally reachable conditions, a measurable deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse with a width narrower than half an optical cycle can be generated. Quantitatively, using a deep-subwavelength-confined 4.4-$\mu$m-wavelength 100-fs pulsed optical driving field and a 2-MeV 50-as 5-pC electron bunch, we can obtain an attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of 2.55 PHz, a pulse width of 99 as ($\sim$0.25 optical cycle), and a single-pulse photon number larger than 200 around the material damage threshold. Such pulses may open opportunities for studying light-matter interaction on the deep-sub-cycle level, and pave a way to unprecedented optical technology ranging from temporal super-resolution optical microscopy and spectroscopy to unconventional atom/molecule polarization and manipulation.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunneling control in photonic potentials by Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tunability of individual coupling amplitudes in photonic lattices is highly desirable for photonic Hamiltonian engineering and for studying topological transitions in situ. In this work, we demonstrate the tunneling control between individual lattice sites patterned inside an optical microcavity. The tuning is achieved by applying a voltage to a liquid crystal microcavity possessing photonic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. This type of spin-orbit coupling emerges due to the high birefringence of the liquid crystal material and constitutes an artificial gauge field for photons. The proposed technique can be combined with strong-light matter coupling and non-Hermitian physics already established in liquid crystal microcavities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in high-energy and high-peak-power laser systems have opened up new possibilities for fundamental physics research. In this work, the potential of twisted light for the generation of gravitational waves in the high frequency regime is explored for the first time. Focusing on Bessel beams, novel analytic expressions and numerical computations for the generated metric perturbations and associated powers are presented. Compelling evidence is provided that the properties of the generated gravitational waves, such as frequency, polarisation states and direction of emission, are controllable by the laser pulse parameters and optical arrangements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical imaging of metabolism can provide key information about health and disease progression in cells and tissues, however, current methods have lacked gold-standard information about histological structure. Conversely, histology and virtual histology methods have lacked metabolic contrast. Here we present a novel microscopy technology, Metabolic Light Absorption, Scattering and Emission (MetaLASE) microscopy, which rapidly provides a virtual histology and optical metabolic readout simultaneously. Photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy achieves nuclei contrast and hematoxylin contrast using ultraviolet absorption and an eosin contrast using the scattered ultraviolet light. The same ultraviolet source excites endogenous NADH, FAD and collagen autofluorescence allowing a measurable Optical Redox Ratios to see enhanced metabolism in areas of invasive carcinoma in breast and prostate tissues compared to benign regions. Benign chronic inflammation and glands also are seen to exhibit hypermetabolism. MetaLASE microscopy offers promise for future applications in intraoperative margin analysis, and in research applications where greater insights into metabolic activity should be correlated with cell and tissue types.</description>

      <title>Enhanced detection of time-dependent dielectric structure: Rayleigh's limit and quantum vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics. Rayleigh criterion normally limits it: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show that putting the dielectric in motion (or time-modulating it) can be useful for determining its susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric susceptibility is similar to moving dielectrics. (ii) A dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within relativistic optics. The vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies. Hence, certain susceptibility features can be determined without shining any incident field on the dielectric. This effect pertains to the far-field domain for (i), and to the near-field (but possibly long-range) domain for (ii). When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced for (i) and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit in the far-field domain.</description>

      <title>A hybrid source of quantum light for generation of frequency tunable Fock states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum-light generation in a nonlinear cavity hybridized with a 2-level system and theoretically show that, when excited by a series of controlled pump pulses, the hybrid source generates Fock states with high probabilities. E.g., 1- and 2-photon states can be generated near-on-demand, and Fock states with up to $7$ photons with a probability above $50\%$. The tailorable nature of the nonlinear cavity allows for generating Fock states with arbitrary frequencies, even with a fixed 2-level system, creating fundamentally new opportunities in all areas of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Single-photon interference over 8.4 km urban atmosphere: towards testing quantum effects in curved spacetime with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum mechanics and general relativity has transformed our understanding of the natural world significantly. However, integrating these two theories presents immense challenges, and their interplay remains untested. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the single-photon interference covering huge space can effectively probe the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. We developed an alternative design using unbalanced Michelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an 8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based on quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this long-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad, which satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at the geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation. Our results confirm the feasibility of the single-photon version of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment for testing the quantum effects in curved spacetime.</description>
