      <title>Virtual Cells: From Conceptual Frameworks to Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of translating vast, multimodal biological data into predictive and mechanistic understanding of cellular function is a central theme in modern biology. Virtual cells, or digital cellular twins, have emerged as a critical paradigm to meet this challenge by creating integrative computational models of cellular processes. This review synthesizes the evolution and current state of the virtual cell, from foundational mechanistic frameworks like the Virtual Cell that employ deterministic and stochastic simulations to the recent transformative impact of artificial intelligence and foundation models. We examine the core technological pillars required to build these models, including the integration of various data types, such as single-cell and spatial omics, the spectrum of modeling approaches, and the bioengineering principles that connect simulation to application. We further discuss key applications, frameworks for model benchmarking and validation, and the significant hurdles that remain, including computational scalability, parameter inference, and ethical considerations, which provides a roadmap for development of predictive virtual cells that promise to revolutionize biomedical research and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Rank Ordering of Species Sensitivities to Chemicals: Discrepancies between Behavioral and Lethal Responses in Freshwater and Marine Invertebrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locomotor behavioural responses are increasingly recognized as sensitive and ecologically relevant indicators for assessing aquatic organism exposure to contaminants. They often occur at concentrations lower than those causing physiological damage, yet their consequences for organisms' fitness and population dynamics remain unclear. Moreover, it is still uncertain how these behavioural endpoints align with traditional toxicological apical endpoints used to assess species sensitivities in risk assessment. This study evaluates the correlation between thresholds triggering locomotor reactions with LC50 values across 19 freshwater and 12 marine invertebrate species exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid and the metal copper. Behavioural responses were measured via videotracking during pulse exposure assays, while 96h acute tests provided species-specific LC50 values for copper. Results reveal strong discrepancies: some highly sensitive species showed no locomotor changes, whereas others tolerant to lethality displayed strong movement responses. For instance, freshwater annelids and gastropods responded markedly to imidacloprid, while marine shrimps exhibited hyperactivity under low copper levels. These findings indicate that relying solely on lethality-based data may underestimate the fraction of species affected by contamination. Integrating behavioural endpoints into population risk assessment frameworks is therefore crucial to better protect aquatic biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Forest tree species classification and entropy-derived uncertainty mapping using extreme gradient boosting and Sentinel-1/2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new 10-meter map of dominant tree species in Swedish forests accompanied by pixel-level uncertainty estimates. The tree species classification is based on spatiotemporal metrics derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, combined with field observations from the Swedish National Forest Inventory. We apply an extreme gradient boosting model with Bayesian optimization to relate field observations to satellite-derived features and generate the final species map. Classification uncertainty is quantified using Shannon's entropy of the predicted class probabilities, which provide a spatially explicit measure of model confidence. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 85% (F1 score = 0.82, Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.81), and mapped species distributions showed strong agreement with official forest statistics (r = 0.96).</description>

      <title>Explicit Path CGR: Maintaining Sequence Fidelity in Geometric Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18408v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery are essential.</description>

      <title>SimpleFold: Folding Proteins is Simpler than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.</description>

      <title>From Noise to Insight: Visualizing Neural Dynamics with Segmented SNR Topographies for Improved EEG-BCI Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based wearable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and non-stationary neural activity. We introduce in this manuscript a mathematically rigorous framework that combines data-driven noise interval evaluation with advanced SNR visualization to address these limitations. Analysis of the publicly available Eye-BCI multimodal dataset demonstrates the method's ability to recover canonical P300 characteristics across frequency bands (delta: 0.5-4 Hz, theta: 4-7.5 Hz, broadband: 1-15 Hz), with precise spatiotemporal localization of both P3a (frontocentral) and P3b (parietal) subcomponents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the impact of noise interval selection on EEG signal quality. Cross-session correlations for four different choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus phases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise interval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems. While validated in healthy participants, our results represent a first step towards providing clinicians with an interpretable tool for detecting neurophysiological abnormalities and provides quantifiable metrics for system optimization.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Calibration and Model Assessment of Cell Migration Dynamics with Surrogate Model Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>THFlow: A Temporally Hierarchical Flow Matching Framework for 3D Peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep generative models provide a promising approach to de novo 3D peptide design. Most of them jointly model the distributions of peptide's position, orientation, and conformation, attempting to simultaneously converge to the target pocket. However, in the early stage of docking, optimizing conformation-only modalities such as rotation and torsion can be physically meaningless, as the peptide is initialized far from the protein pocket and no interaction field is present. We define this problem as the multimodal temporal inconsistency problem and claim it is a key factor contributing to low binding affinity in generated peptides. To address this challenge, we propose THFlow, a novel flow matching-based multimodal generative model that explicitly models the temporal hierarchy between peptide position and conformation. It employs a polynomial based conditional flow to accelerate positional convergence early on, and later aligns it with rotation and torsion for coordinated conformation refinement under the emerging interaction field. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related features, such as polarity, to further enhance the model's understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering an effective and accurate solution for advancing peptide-based therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>Complexity-Informed Causal Modeling of Neurodevelopmental Trajectories in Pediatric High-Grade Gliomas: Divergences from Neural Stem Cell Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pediatric high grade gliomas are lethal evolutionary disorders with stalled developmental trajectories and disrupted differentiation hierarchies. We integrate transcriptional and algorithmic network complexity based perturbation analysis to elucidate gene expression patterns and molecular divergence between Diffuse Midline Gliomas and glioblastoma, revealing shared developmental programs steering cell fate decision making. Our complex systems approach supports the emerging paradigm that pediatric high grade gliomas are neurodevelopmental disorders with hybrid lineage identities and disrupted patterning. We identify dysregulated neurodevelopmental and morphogenetic signatures, alongside bioelectric and neurotransmitter signaling programs that alter synaptic organization, neuronal fate commitment, and phenotypic plasticity, regulating glioma phenotypic switching. Causal drivers and regulators of plasticity were predicted as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, reinforcing the view that pediatric gliomas are disorders of cell fate decisions and collective cellular identity. Decoded plasticity signatures indicate a teleonomic bias toward neural progenitor or neuron like identities, while synaptic transmission gene enrichment supports neuron glioma interactions shaping fate trajectories. These findings advance differentiation therapy as a systems medicine strategy, discovering plasticity regulators to reprogram malignant fates toward stable lineages, offering complex systems based targets for cancer reversion and predictive, preventive, precision oncology.</description>

      <title>CEP-IP: An Explainable Framework for Cell Subpopulation Identification in Single-cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12073</link>

Abstract: TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. This study introduces the CEP-IP framework, a novel explainable machine learning approach for the identification of biologically relevant cell subpopulations in single-cell transcriptomics of pairwise genes. The framework combines cell explanatory power (CEP) classification with inflection point (IP) analysis to assign model performance into individual cells, while stratifying transcriptional space into distinct regions. To demonstrate the CEP-IP framework, generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to model relationships between TRPM4 and co-expressed genes in aggressive PCa and benign prostate cells from scRNA-seq data. Genes were identified using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, RPS26; averaged as Ribo gene set) passed dual-filtering specifically in PCa cells. TRPM4-Ribo modeling outperformed alternative cancer gene sets (deviance explained FDR&lt;0.05). The CEP-IP framework identified top-ranked explanatory power (TREP) cells and stratified them using IP analysis into pre-IP and post-IP regions, creating four distinct cell subpopulations per patient. Gene Ontology analysis revealed pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related processes, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, the explainable CEP-IP framework allows for the identification of cancer cell subpopulations with distinctive biology and therapeutic implications, applicable to any pairwise gene analysis.</description>
