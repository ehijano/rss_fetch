      <title>Reaction Rate Theory for Electric Field Catalysis in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of an external, oriented electric field has emerged as an attractive technique for manipulating chemical reactions. Because most applications occur in solution, a theory of electric field catalysis requires treatment of the solvent, whose interaction with both the external field and the reacting species modifies the reaction energetics and thus the reaction rate. Here, we formulate such a transition state theory using a dielectric continuum model, and we incorporate dynamical effects due to solvent motion via Grote-Hynes corrections. We apply our theory to the Menshutkin reaction between $\mathrm{CH_3I}$ and pyridine, which is catalyzed by polar solvents, and to the symmetric $\mathrm{S_N2}$ reaction of $\mathrm{F^-}$ with $\mathrm{CH_3F}$, which is inhibited by polar solvents. At low applied field strengths when the solvent responds linearly, our theory predicts near-complete quenching of electric field catalysis. However, a qualitative treatment of the nonlinear response (i.e., dielectric saturation) shows that catalysis can be recovered at appreciable field strengths as solvent molecules begin to align with the applied field direction. The Grote-Hynes corrrection to the rate constant is seen to vary nonmonotonically with increasing solvent polarity due to contrasting effects of the screening ability, and the longitudinal relaxation time of the solvent.</description>

      <title>Efficient configuration-interaction models for photoionization of molecular dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present R-matrix calculations of photoionization of molecular monomers and dimers, focusing on ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH), utilizing configuration-interaction models including the Occupation-Restricted Multiple Active Space (ORMAS) approach. We show that ORMAS is a highly efficient choice for calculating photoionization observables, yielding results that are in excellent agreement with those obtained using the much more demanding configuration-interaction method, Complete Active Space (CAS). We demonstrate that models incorporating single and double (SD) excitations with respect to the Hartree-Fock configuration provide good agreement with experimental data. The approach developed here can be readily applied to study photoionization in complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel: influence of post-processing, printing direction, temperature and pre-straining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of post-build processing on the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of additively manufactured (AM) 316L stainless steel fabricated using laser powder bed fusion was assessed at both room temperature and -50$^\circ$ C via uniaxial tensile experiments. In the absence of hydrogen at ambient temperature, all four evaluated AM conditions (as-built (AB), annealed (ANN), hot isostatic pressed (HIP), and HIP plus cold worked (CW) to 30\%) exhibit notably reduced ductility relative to conventionally manufactured (CM) 316L stainless steel. The AM material exhibits sensitivity to the build direction, both in the presence and absence of hydrogen, with a notable increase in yield strength in the X direction and enhanced ductility in the Z direction. Conversely, testing of non-charged specimens at -50$^\circ$ C revealed similar ductility between the CM, AB, ANN, and HIP conditions. Upon hydrogen charging, the ductility of all four AM conditions was found to be similar to that of CM 316L at ambient temperature, with the HIP condition actually exceeding the CM material. Critically, testing of hydrogen-charged samples at -50$^\circ$ C revealed that the ductility of the HIP AM 316L condition was nearly double that observed in the CM 316L. This improved performance persisted even after cold working, as the CW AM 316L exhibited comparable ductility to CM 316L at -50 C after hydrogen charging, despite having a 2-fold higher yield strength. Feritscope measurements suggest this increased performance is related to the reduced propensity for AM 316L to form strain-induced martensite during deformation, even after significant post-processing treatments. These results demonstrate that AM 316L can be post-processed using typical procedures to exhibit similar to or even improved resistance to hydrogen embrittlement relative to CM 316L.</description>

      <title>Spectral Map: Embedding Slow Kinetics in Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of physical systems that require high-dimensional representation can often be captured in a few meaningful degrees of freedom called collective variables (CVs). However, identifying CVs is challenging and constitutes a fundamental problem in physical chemistry. This problem is even more pronounced when CVs information about slow kinetics related to rare transitions between long-lived metastable states. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised deep-learning method called spectral map. Our method constructs slow CVs by maximizing the spectral gap between slow and fast eigenvalues of a transition matrix estimated by an anisotropic diffusion kernel. We demonstrate our method in several high-dimensional reversible folding processes.</description>

      <title>Are large language models superhuman chemists?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest due to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. This is relevant for the chemical sciences, which face the problem of small and diverse datasets that are frequently in the form of text. LLMs have shown promise in addressing these issues and are increasingly being harnessed to predict chemical properties, optimize reactions, and even design and conduct experiments autonomously. However, we still have only a very limited systematic understanding of the chemical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harms. Here, we introduce "ChemBench," an automated framework designed to rigorously evaluate the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of human chemists. We curated more than 7,000 question-answer pairs for a wide array of subfields of the chemical sciences, evaluated leading open and closed-source LLMs, and found that the best models outperformed the best human chemists in our study on average. The models, however, struggle with some chemical reasoning tasks that are easy for human experts and provide overconfident, misleading predictions, such as about chemicals' safety profiles. These findings underscore the dual reality that, although LLMs demonstrate remarkable proficiency in chemical tasks, further research is critical to enhancing their safety and utility in chemical sciences. Our findings also indicate a need for adaptations to chemistry curricula and highlight the importance of continuing to develop evaluation frameworks to improve safe and useful LLMs.</description>

      <title>Rugged potential of mean force and underscreening of polarizable colloids in concentrated electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses advanced numerical methods to estimate the mean force potential (PMF) between charged, polarizable colloidal particles in dense electrolytes. We observe that when the Debye screening length, $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$, is below the hydrated ion size, the PMF shows discernible oscillations, contrasting with the expected decay in DLVO theory. Our findings provide evidence for the existence of anomalous underscreening in electrostatically stabilized suspensions, potentially having significant implications for our understanding of colloidal stability and the forces that govern the behavior of concentrated charged soft matter systems beyond DLVO theory.</description>

      <title>Ab initio extended Hubbard model of short polyenes for efficient quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose introducing an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian derived via the ab initio downfolding method, which was originally formulated for periodic materials, towards efficient quantum computing of molecular electronic structure calculations. By utilizing this method, the first-principles Hamiltonian of chemical systems can be coarse-grained by eliminating the electronic degrees of freedom in higher energy space and reducing the number of terms of electron repulsion integral from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. Our approach is validated numerically on the vertical excitation energies and excitation characters of ethylene, butadiene, and hexatriene. The dynamical electron correlation is incorporated within the framework of the constrained random phase approximation in advance of quantum computations, and the constructed models capture the trend of experimental and high-level quantum chemical calculation results. As expected, the $L^1$-norm of the fermion-to-qubit mapped model Hamiltonians is significantly lower than that of conventional ab initio Hamiltonians, suggesting improved scalability of quantum computing. Those numerical outcomes and the results of the simulation of excited-state sampling demonstrate that the ab initio extended Hubbard Hamiltonian may hold significant potential for quantum chemical calculations using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Determining the chemical composition of diamagnetic mixed solids via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed solid compounds are employed in a vast array of applications so an accurate determination of their chemical compositions is of crucial importance. All current characterization methods require specially-treated samples so the availability of a more practical method with similar accuracy should alleviate the quantification process. In this work, we show how the doping concentration $\delta$ (or isotope concentration) of a mixed solid compound in powdered form, where both parent compounds are diamagnetic, can be obtained from the measurement of the mass magnetization. We exploit the additive nature of the molar magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{Mol}$ and molar mass to construct two equations with the same two unknowns in the $\chi_{Mol}$ vs. $\delta$ space to simultaneously solve $\chi_{Mol}$ and $\delta$ of a mixed solid. Eight examples are provided to show the wide applicability of this method: NH$_{4(1-\delta)}$D$_{4\delta}$Br (where D = $^2$H), NH$_4$I$_{1-\delta}$Br$_\delta$, (NH$_4$H$_2$)$_{1-\delta}$(ND$_4$D$_2$)$_\delta$PO$_4$, C$_{48}$H$_{22+6\delta}$Br$_{6(1-\delta)}$O$_{32}$Zr$_6$, [creatine]$_{1-\delta}$[$_D$-glucose]$_\delta$, [$_L$-glutamic acid]$_{1-\delta}$[$_L$-leucine]$_\delta$, [terephthalic acid]$_{1-\delta}$[trimesic acid]$_\delta$ and [p-terphenyl]$_{1-\delta}$[triphenylphosphine]$_\delta$. Experimental errors of ~1.2% were obtained for $\delta$ from average sample masses of 16.6 mg in powdered form rendering the presented approach an attractive choice for characterizing the ratios of mixed solids.</description>

      <title>Generalizable, Fast, and Accurate DeepQSPR with fastprop Part 1: Framework and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Structure Property Relationship studies aim to define a mapping between molecular structure and arbitrary quantities of interest. This was historically accomplished via the development of descriptors which requires significant domain expertise and struggles to generalize. Thus the field has morphed into Molecular Property Prediction and been given over to learned representations which are highly generalizable. The paper introduces fastprop, a DeepQSPR framework which uses a cogent set of molecular level descriptors to meet and exceed the performance of learned representations on diverse datasets in dramatically less time. fastprop is freely available on github at github.com/JacksonBurns/fastprop.</description>

      <title>Identifiability Study of Lithium-Ion Battery Capacity Fade Using Degradation Mode Sensitivity for a Minimally and Intuitively Parametrized Electrode-Specific Cell Open-Circuit Voltage Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two electrode open-circuit potentials form a full-cell OCV (open-circuit voltage) model, cell-level SOH (state of health) parameters related to LLI (loss of lithium inventory) and LAM (loss of active materials) naturally appear. Such models have been used to interpret experimental OCV measurements and infer these SOH parameters associated with capacity fade. In this work, we first re-parametrize a popular OCV model formulation by the N/P (negative-to-positive) ratio and Li/P (lithium-to-positive) ratio, which have more symmetric and intuitive physical meaning, and are also pristine-condition-agnostic and cutoff-voltage-independent. We then study the modal identifiability of capacity fade by mathematically deriving the gradients of electrode slippage and cell OCV with respect to these SOH parameters, where the electrode differential voltage fractions, which characterize each electrode's relative contribution to the OCV slope, play a key role in passing the influence of a fixed cutoff voltage to the parameter sensitivity. The sensitivity gradients of the total capacity also reveal four characteristic regimes regarding how much lithium inventory and active materials are limiting the apparent capacity. We show the usefulness of these sensitivity gradients with an application regarding degradation mode identifiability from OCV measurements at different SOC (state of charge) windows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-time behavior of many complex molecular systems is often governed by slow relaxation dynamics that can be described by a few reaction coordinates referred to as collective variables (CVs). However, identifying CVs hidden in a high-dimensional configuration space poses a fundamental challenge in chemical physics. To address this problem, we expand on a recently introduced deep-learning technique called spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22, 5216-5220]. Spectral map learns CVs by maximizing a spectral gap between slow and fast eigenvalues of a Markov transition matrix describing anisotropic diffusion. An introduced modification in the learning algorithm allows spectral map to represent multiscale free-energy landscapes. Through a Markov state model analysis, we validate that spectral map learns slow CVs related to the dominant relaxation timescales and discerns between long-lived metastable states.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation: Exact mapping onto an electronically non-interacting Kohn-Sham molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an alternative, general, and in-principle exact extension of electronic Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) to the fully quantum-mechanical molecular problem. Unlike in existing multi-component or exact-factorization-based DFTs of electrons and nuclei, both nuclear and electronic densities are mapped onto a fictitious electronically non-interacting molecule (referred to as KS molecule), where the electrons still interact with the nuclei. Moreover, in the present molecular KS-DFT, no assumption is made about the mathematical form (exactly factorized or not) of the molecular wavefunction. By expanding the KS molecular wavefunction \`a la Born-Huang, we obtain a self-consistent set of "KS beyond Born-Oppenheimer" electronic equations coupled to nuclear equations that describe nuclei interacting among themselves and with non-interacting electrons. An exact adiabatic connection formula is derived for the Hartree-exchange-correlation energy of the electrons within the molecule and, on that basis, a practical adiabatic density-functional approximation is proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Crystal Structure Prediction from Powder X-Ray Diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) has made significant progress, but most methods focus on unconditional generations of inorganic crystal with limited atoms in the unit cell. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant deep generative model for end-to-end CSP from Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD). Unlike previous methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet's effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 datasets in conditional crystal structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet represents a significant advance in CSP, enabling the prediction of complex structures from PXRD data without the need for external databases or manual intervention. It has the potential to revolutionize PXRD analysis. It enables the direct prediction of crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for manual intervention and external databases. This opens up new possibilities for automated crystal structure determination and the accelerated discovery of novel materials.</description>

      <title>Stability of C$_{59}$ Knockout Fragments from Femtoseconds to Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the stability of C$_{59}$ anions as a function of time, from their formation on femtosecond timescales to their stabilization on second timescales and beyond, using a combination of theory and experiments. The C$_{59}^-$ fragments were produced in collisions between C$_{60}$ fullerene anions and neutral helium gas at a velocity of 90 km/s (corresponding to a collision energy of 166 eV in the center-of-mass frame). The fragments were then stored in a cryogenic ion-beam storage ring at the DESIREE facility where they were followed for up to one minute. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the reaction cross section and the excitation energy distributions of the products formed in these collisions. We found that about 15 percent of the C$_{59}^-$ ions initially stored in the ring are intact after about 100 ms, and that this population then remains intact indefinitely. This means that C$_{60}$ fullerenes exposed to energetic atoms and ions, such as stellar winds and shock waves, will produce stable, highly reactive products, like C$_{59}$, that are fed into interstellar chemical reaction networks.</description>

Abstract: In molecular dynamics simulations, rare events, such as protein folding, are typically studied using enhanced sampling techniques, most of which are based on the definition of a collective variable (CV) along which acceleration occurs. Obtaining an expressive CV is crucial, but often hindered by the lack of information about the particular event, e.g., the transition from unfolded to folded conformation. We propose a simulation-free data augmentation strategy using physics-inspired metrics to generate geodesic interpolations resembling protein folding transitions, thereby improving sampling efficiency without true transition state samples. Leveraging interpolation progress parameters, we introduce a regression-based learning scheme for CV models, which outperforms classifier-based methods when transition state data are limited and noisy.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum light-induced non-adiabaticity in molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exchange of energy between electronic and nuclear motion is the origin of non-adiabaticity and plays an important role in many molecular phenomena and processes. Conical intersections (CIs) of different electronic potential energy surfaces lead to the most singular non-adiabaticity and have been intensely investigated. The coupling of light and matter induces conical intersections which are termed light-induced conical intersections (LICIs). There are two kinds of LICIs, those induced by classical (laser) light and those by quantum light like that provided by a cavity. The present work reviews the subject of LICIs, discussing the achievements made so far. Particular attention is paid to comparing classical and quantum LICIs, their similarities and differences and their relationship to naturally occurring CIs. In contrast to natural CIs, the properties of which are dictated by nature, the properties of their light-induced counterparts are controllable by choosing the frequency and intensity (or coupling to the cavity) of the external light source. This opens the door to inducing and manipulating various kinds of non-adiabatic effects. Several examples of diatomic and polyatomic molecules are presented covering both dynamics and spectroscopy. The computational methods employed are discussed as well. To our opinion, the young field of LICIs and their impact show much future potential.</description>

      <title>Understanding Energy Level Structure Using Quantum Rubik's Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study combines the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix with the Benalcazar Bernevig Hughes model, defines a matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, and constructs an expression for the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation of the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix clearer, we use a Josephus ring to draw a topological graph of the Rubik's Cube expansion. This article uses a quantum Rubik's Cube to calculate energy level transitions of electrons, and shows that its operation corresponds to path integration. The band dispersion is obtained. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonians and studying energy level structure.</description>
