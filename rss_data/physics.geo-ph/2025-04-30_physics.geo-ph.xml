      <title>Study on impact mechanism and precursor information induced by high intensity mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With heightened mining intensity, the incidence of coal bursts is escalating, necessitating advanced understanding and prediction techniques. This research delves into the intricacies of coal burst mechanisms, proposing a novel theoretical model for the release of coal mass energy founded on the tenets of stress superposition. A significant revelation is that the energy culminating in a coal burst is an amalgamation of intrinsic coal strain energy and perturbations from mining activities. Field investigations scrutinize the microseismic parameters across a spectrum of mining velocities, discerning potential failure regions and precursor hallmarks in high-intensity mining environments. Notably, microseismic energy, in such contexts, experiences an augmentation of approximately 2000 J. Numerical simulations executed via 3DEC elucidate stress distribution patterns and failure modalities of adjacent rock structures in relation to mining velocities. The simulations underscore that an uptick in mining speed diminishes the buffer to high-pressure abutments, intensifying inherent pressures. For mitigation, it's advocated that high-intensity mining advances be capped at 11 m/d. Merging theoretical analysis, experimental data, field assessments, and computational simulations, this study proffers a holistic insight into coal burst dynamics, underscoring its value in refining monitoring and early warning protocols in the domain.</description>

      <title>Force chain dynamics in a quasi-static granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nature, granular materials fail in abrupt avalanches, earthquakes, and other hazardous events, and also creep over time. Proposed failure mechanisms for these systems are broadly framed as friction-limited. However, mechanical descriptions of friction in granular system vary, including those that consider the non-linear, heterogeneous dynamics of grain-contact forces. In order to study granular controls on failure and creep, we imaged contact forces between quasi-2D photoelastic discs at 15-minute intervals in experiments over weeks- to one-month-long observation periods. In the experiments, the particles are distributed in a slope below the angle of repose with a concomitant establishment of the force-chain network approximately along the principal static stress directions. The discrete force-chain shifts are initially described by an age-weakening Weibull distribution in frequency over time, with the most common clusters of events $&lt;$1000 minutes apart, but there are long quiescent periods that are not well described by the distribution. The post-settling discrete events accompany a longer term strengthening of the localized stresses. We observe that some events may be related to 2$^o$C temperature change, but associated ground motions measured by a seismometer appear to have no correlation with particle displacements or force-chain changes. The results illustrate that local, grain-scale changes in force-chain networks can occur long after a granular pile reaches a mesoscale apparently stable state, sometimes without obvious external forcings or imposed state changes. Such force-chain dynamics may underlie transitions in natural granular systems between large-scale failures and creep events.</description>

      <title>Identifying the approach of a major earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analyzing the seismicity in natural time and studying the evolution of the fluctuations of the entropy change of seismicity under time reversal for various scales of different length i (number of events), we can identify the approach of a major earthquake (EQ) occurrence. The current investigation is extended from 1984 until 2025 for the seismicity in Japan.</description>
