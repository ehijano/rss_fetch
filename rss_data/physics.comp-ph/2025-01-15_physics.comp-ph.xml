      <title>Non-autonomous standard nontwist map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Area-preserving nontwist maps locally violate the twist condition, giving rise to shearless curves. Nontwist systems appear in different physical contexts, such as plasma physics, climate physics, classical mechanics, etc. Generic properties of nontwist maps are captured by the standard nontwist map, which depends on a convection parameter $a$ and a modulation coefficient $b$. In the spirit of non-autonomous systems, we consider the standard nontwist map (SNM) with a linearly increasing modulation coefficient, and we investigate the evolution of an ensemble of points on the phase space that initially lies on the shearless invariant curve in the initial state, called shearless snapshot torus. Differently from the SNM with constant parameters -- where we can see different scenarios of collision/annihilation of periodic orbits leading to global transport, depending on the region in the parameter space -- for the SNM with time-dependent parameters, the route to chaos is not only related to the path in the $(a, b)$ parameter space, but also to the scenario of the evolution of parameter $b_n$. In this work, we identify power-law relationships between key parameters for the chaotic transition and the iteration time. Additionally, we analyze system reversibility during the chaotic transition and demonstrate an extra transport, where parameter variation modifies the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Band Structure Modeling of Perovskite Materials with Quantum ESPRESSO for Multijunction Photovoltaic Cell Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing photovoltaic conversion efficiency, or PCE, has proven to be a critical factor in the transition to renewable energy. There exist strong interdependencies between the perovskite crystals and multijunction architectures within photovoltaic cell research. In present literature, there is a lack of intersection in investigating crystallographic geometry and compositional engineering with representation of computational modeling systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the rapid discovery of high-efficiency perovskite-based multijunction cells, specifically with silicon as the low band gap absorbing semiconductor material. We model the spatial geometries of potential perovskite candidates for high-efficiency cells using the Schrodinger Material Science Maestro, optimizing the periodic boundary conditions on the unit cell to minimize edge-bound errors. Band structure calculations using density functional theory become effective to approximate the PCE. After careful adjustments to the ibrav lattice parameter and parallelization, Quantum ESPRESSO was optimized for perovskite multijunction band structure calculations. Computational results on the six test-perovskite configurations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed representation and method, with a calculated efficiency of about 46% for one of the modeled perovskites, placing it at the top of high-efficiency perovskite-Si multijunction cells. With this method, the potential exists to bring forth a new generation of photovoltaic cells that are easily manufacturable, highly efficient, and economical.</description>

      <title>PINN-FEM: A Hybrid Approach for Enforcing Dirichlet Boundary Conditions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding governing equations and boundary/initial conditions into the loss function. However, enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions accurately remains challenging, often leading to soft enforcement that compromises convergence and reliability in complex domains. We propose a hybrid approach, PINN-FEM, which combines PINNs with finite element methods (FEM) to impose strong Dirichlet boundary conditions via domain decomposition. This method incorporates FEM-based representations near the boundary, ensuring exact enforcement without compromising convergence. Through six experiments of increasing complexity, PINN-FEM outperforms standard PINN models, showcasing superior accuracy and robustness. While distance functions and similar techniques have been proposed for boundary condition enforcement, they lack generality for real-world applications. PINN-FEM bridges this gap by leveraging FEM near boundaries, making it well-suited for industrial and scientific problems.</description>

      <title>TeNeS-v2: Enhancement for Real-Time and Finite Temperature Simulations of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are challenging targets for computational physics due to their large degrees of freedom. The tensor networks, particularly Tensor Product States (TPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), effectively represent these systems on two-dimensional lattices. However, the technical complexity of TPS/PEPS-based coding is often too much for researchers to handle. To reduce this problem, we developed TeNeS (Tensor Network Solver). This paper introduces TeNeS-v2, which extends TeNeS with real-time and finite temperature simulations, providing deeper insights into quantum many-body systems. We detail the new algorithms, input/output design, and application examples, demonstrating TeNeS-v2's applicability to various quantum spin and Bose models on two-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Mean-squared Energy Difference for Exploring Potential Energy Landscapes of Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By extending the concept of diffusion to the potential energy landscapes (PELs), we introduce the mean-squared energy difference (MSED) as a novel quantity to investigate the intrinsic properties of glass. MSED can provide a clear description of the "energy relaxation" process on a PEL. Through MSED analysis, we can obtain characteristic timescale similar to those from structure analysis, namely $\tau_\alpha^*$. We establish a connection between MSED and the properties of PELs, providing a concise and quantitative description of the PEL. We find that the roughness of the accessible PEL has changed significantly after the glass transition. And we also find that one of the PEL parameters is closely related to the Adam-Gibbs configurational entropy. The present research, which directly links the PEL to the relaxation process, provides avenues for further research of the glass.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial ``zones'' with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our ``zoned discrete axisymmetry'' (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Is genuine nonlocality in the triangle network exclusive to pure states?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genuine network non-locality (GNN) refers to the existence of quantum correlations in a network with independent sources that cannot be explained by local hidden-variables (LHV) models. Even in the simplest scenario, determining whether these quantum correlations remain genuinely network non-local when derived from entangled states that deviate from their ideal forms is highly challenging due to the non-convex nature of local correlations. Understanding the boundary of these correlations thus becomes a hard problem, but one that raises academic interest specifically its robustness to noise. To address this problem, we introduce a causal domain-informed learning algorithm called the LHV k-rank neural network, which assesses the rank parameter of the non-ideal combined state produced by sources. Applied to the triangle network scenario with the three sources generating a class of quantum states known as X states, the neural network reveals that non-locality persists only if the states remain pure. Remarkably, we find that even slight deviations from ideal Bell states due to noise cause GNN to vanish, exhibiting a discrete behavior that hasn't been witnessed in the standard bell scenario. This finding thus raises a fundamental question as to whether GNN in the triangle network is exclusive to pure states or not. Additionally, we explore the case of the three sources producing dissimilar states, indicating that GNN requires all its sources to send pure entangled states with joint entangled measurements as resources. Apart from these results, this work succeeds in showing that machine learning approaches with domain-specific constraints can greatly benefit the field of quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation of the Shepard renormalization factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correct treatment of boundary conditions is a key step in the development of the SPH method. The SPH community has to face several challenges in this regard - in particular, a primordial aspect for any boundary formulation is to ensure the consistency of the operators in presence of boundaries and free surfaces. A new implementation is proposed, based on the existing numerical boundary integrals formulation. A new kernel expression is developed to compute the Shepard renormalization factor at the boundary purely as a function of the geometry. In order to evaluate this factor, the resulting expression is split into numerical and analytical parts, which allows accurately computing the Shepard factor. The new expression is satisfactorily tested for different planar geometries, showing that problems featuring free surfaces and boundaries are solved. The methodology is also extended to 3-D geometries without great increase in computational cost.</description>

      <title>A decoupled, convergent and fully linear algorithm for the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation with magnetoelastic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the coupled system of the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation and the conservation of linear momentum law to describe magnetic processes in ferromagnetic materials including magnetoelastic effects in the small-strain regime. For this nonlinear system of time-dependent partial differential equations, we present a decoupled integrator based on first-order finite elements in space and an implicit one-step method in time. We prove unconditional convergence of the sequence of discrete approximations towards a weak solution of the system as the mesh size and the time-step size go to zero. Compared to previous numerical works on this problem, for our method, we prove a discrete energy law that mimics that of the continuous problem and, passing to the limit, yields an energy inequality satisfied by weak solutions. Moreover, our method does not employ a nodal projection to impose the unit length constraint on the discrete magnetisation, so that the stability of the method does not require weakly acute meshes. Furthermore, our integrator and its analysis hold for a more general setting, including body forces and traction, as well as a more general representation of the magnetostrain. Numerical experiments underpin the theory and showcase the applicability of the scheme for the simulation of the dynamical processes involving magnetoelastic materials at submicrometer length scales.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance.In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <title>Tailoring light holes in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Anion-Anion Antibonding Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant limitation of wide-bandgap materials is their low hole mobility related to localized holes with heavy effective masses ($m_h^*$). We identify in low-symmetric wide-bandgap compounds an anion-anion antibonding coupling (AAAC) effect as the intrinsic factor behind hole localization, which explains the extremely heavy $m_h^*$ and self-trapped hole (STH) formation observed in gallium oxide ($\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$). We propose a design principle for achieving light holes by manipulating AAAC, demonstrating that specific strain conditions can reduce $m_h^*$ in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ from 4.77 $m_0$ to 0.38 $m_0$, making it comparable to the electron mass (0.28 $m_0$), while also slightly suppresses the formation of self-trapped holes, evidenced by the reduction in the formation energy of hole polarons from -0.57 eV to -0.45 eV under tensile strain. The light holes show significant anisotropy, potentially enabling two-dimensional transport in bulk material. This study provides a fundamental understanding of hole mass enhancement and STH formation in novel wide-bandgap materials and suggest new pathways for engineering hole mobilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linking the fundamental physics of band structure and scattering theory with macroscopic features such as measurable bulk thermoelectric transport properties is indispensable to a thorough understanding of transport phenomena and ensures more targeted and efficient experimental research. Here, we introduce SeeBand, a highly efficient and interactive fitting tool based on Boltzmann transport theory. A fully integrated user interface and visualization tool enable real-time comparison and connection between the electronic band structure (EBS) and microscopic transport properties. It allows simultaneous analysis of data for the Seebeck coefficient $S$, resistivity $\rho$ and Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$ to identify suitable EBS models and extract the underlying microscopic material parameters and additional information from the model. Crucially, the EBS can be obtained by directly fitting the temperature-dependent properties of a single sample, which goes beyond previous approaches that look into doping dependencies. Finally, the combination of neural-network-assisted initial guesses and an efficient subsequent fitting routine allows for a rapid processing of big datasets, facilitating high-throughput analyses to identify underlying, yet undiscovered dependencies, thereby guiding material design.</description>

Abstract: The development of industrial growth raises global energy demand. Novel materials with promising unorthodox features satiate and demand for sustainable, non-toxic, and cost-effective energy. A first-principles investigation were carried out to ground state and transport properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ towards energy harvesting and photocatalytic applications was carried out. In groundstate the CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ showed good mechanically stable with a volume of (1138.235 \text{\AA}^3) and a high elastic modulus of (215.73 GPa). Further, the electronic properties of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$, PBE-GGA exchange-correlation was utilized, demonstrates direct and indirect transitions with a wide bandgap of 2.7 and 2.8 eV, indicating its semiconducting nature. Photoinduced charge carriers were investigated through Deformation Potential Theory (DPT) to estimate the mobility of charge carriers, excitonic radius, and effective mass. Axial anisotropic strain in band degeneracy and shifts in the S-Y and Y-\Gamma transitions offer a (3.17 \text{\AA}^3) Frenkel-type strongly bound exciton with a high carrier mobility of (2409.91 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}) electrons and (316.46 \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{V}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}) holes respectively. To estimate the feasibility of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ in photocatalysis, we examined the conduction and valence band edges under harsh pH conditions within PBE-GGA exchange-correlation functionals. The band edges of CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ show the halfway reaction for hydrogen evolution with reference to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE). Moreover, the Boltzmann equation interface was used to investigate the transport and thermoelectric properties. A high Seebeck coefficient in CaV$_2$TeO$_8$ at 300 K directs a thermoelectric figure of merit of 0.94.</description>
