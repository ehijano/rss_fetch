      <title>Joint operation of a fast-charging EV hub with a stand-alone independent battery storage system under fairness considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for larger-scale fast-charging electric vehicle (EV) hubs is on the rise due to the growth in EV adoption. Another area of power infrastructure growth is the proliferation of independently operated stand-alone battery storage systems (BSS), which is fueled by improvements and cost reductions in battery technology. Many possible uses of the stand-alone BSS are being explored including participation in the energy and ancillary markets, load balancing for renewable generations, and supporting large-scale load-consuming entities like hospitals. In this paper, we study a novel usage of the stand-alone BSS whereby in addition to participating in the electricity reserve market, it allows an EV hub to use a part of its storage capacity, when profitable. The hub uses the BSS storage capacity for arbitrage consequently reducing its operating cost. We formulate this joint operation as a bi-objective optimization model. We then reformulate it into a second-order cone Nash bargaining problem, the solution of which guarantees fairness to both the hub and the BSS. A sample numerical case study is formulated using actual prices of electricity and simulated data for the reserve market and EV charging demand. The Nash bargaining solution shows that both participants can benefit from the joint operation.</description>

      <title>Power Failure Cascade Prediction using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting power failure cascades due to branch failures. We propose a flow-free model based on graph neural networks that predicts grid states at every generation of a cascade process given an initial contingency and power injection values. We train the proposed model using a cascade sequence data pool generated from simulations. We then evaluate our model at various levels of granularity. We present several error metrics that gauge the model's ability to predict the failure size, the final grid state, and the failure time steps of each branch within the cascade. We benchmark the graph neural network model against influence models. We show that, in addition to being generic over randomly scaled power injection values, the graph neural network model outperforms multiple influence models that are built specifically for their corresponding loading profiles. Finally, we show that the proposed model reduces the computational time by almost two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Adaptive tracking control for non-periodic reference signals under quantized observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an adaptive tracking control problem for stochastic regression systems with multi-threshold quantized observations. Different from the existing studies for periodic reference signals, the reference signal in this paper is non-periodic. Its main difficulty is how to ensure that the designed controller satisfies the uniformly bounded and excitation conditions that guarantee the convergence of the estimation in the controller under non-periodic signal conditions. This paper designs two backward-shifted polynomials with time-varying parameters and a special projection structure, which break through periodic limitations and establish the convergence and tracking properties. To be specific, the adaptive tracking control law can achieve asymptotically optimal tracking for the non-periodic reference signal; Besides, the proposed estimation algorithm is proved to converge to the true values in almost sure and mean square sense, and the convergence speed can reach $O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ under suitable conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive tracking control scheme is verified through a simulation.</description>

      <title>3D Guidance Law for Maximal Coverage and Target Enclosing with Inherent Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of enclosing an arbitrarily moving target in three dimensions by a single pursuer, which is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), for maximum coverage while also ensuring the pursuer's safety by preventing collisions with the target. The proposed guidance strategy steers the pursuer to a safe region of space surrounding the target, allowing it to maintain a certain distance from the latter while offering greater flexibility in positioning and converging to any orbit within this safe zone. Our approach is distinguished by the use of nonholonomic constraints to model vehicles with accelerations serving as control inputs and coupled engagement kinematics to craft the pursuer's guidance law meticulously. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of the Lyapunov Barrier Function as a powerful tool to constrain the distance between the pursuer and the target within asymmetric bounds, thereby ensuring the pursuer's safety within the predefined region. To validate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithm, we conduct experimental tests by implementing a high-fidelity quadrotor model within Software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, encompassing various challenging target maneuver scenarios. The results obtained showcase the resilience of the proposed guidance law, effectively handling arbitrarily maneuvering targets, vehicle/autopilot dynamics, and external disturbances. Our method consistently delivers stable global enclosing behaviors, even in response to aggressive target maneuvers, and requires only relative information for successful execution.</description>

      <title>The Continuous-Time Weighted-Median Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics models are important in understanding and predicting opinion formation processes within social groups. Although the weighted-averaging opinion-update mechanism is widely adopted as the micro-foundation of opinion dynamics, it bears a non-negligibly unrealistic implication: opinion attractiveness increases with opinion distance. Recently, the weighted-median mechanism has been proposed as a new microscopic mechanism of opinion exchange. Numerous advancements have been achieved regarding this new micro-foundation, from theoretical analysis to empirical validation, in a discrete-time asynchronous setup. However, the original discrete-time weighted-median model does not allow for "compromise behavior" in opinion exchanges, i.e., no intermediate opinions are created between disagreeing agents. To resolve this problem, this paper propose a novel continuous-time weighted-median opinion dynamics model, in which agents' opinions move towards the weighted-medians of their out-neighbors' opinions. It turns out that the proof methods for the original discrete-time asynchronous model are no longer applicable to the analysis of the continuous-time model. In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the continuous-time weighted-median opinion dynamics by showing that the weighted-median mapping is contractive on any graph. We also characterize the set of all the equilibria. Then, by leveraging a new LaSalle invariance principle argument, we prove the convergence of the continuous-time weighted-median model for any initial condition and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence to consensus.</description>

      <title>Stability-Oriented Prediction Horizons Design of Generalized Predictive Control for DC/DC Boost Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach in designing prediction horizons on a generalized predictive control for a DC/DC boost converter. This method involves constructing a closed-loop system model and assessing the impact of different prediction horizons on system stability. In contrast to conventional design approaches that often rely on empirical prediction horizon selection or incorporate non-linear observers, the proposed method establishes a rigorous boundary for the prediction horizon to ensure system stability. This approach facilitates the selection of an appropriate prediction horizon while avoiding excessively short horizons that can lead to instability and preventing the adoption of unnecessarily long horizons that would burden the controller with high computational demands. Finally, the accuracy of the design method has been confirmed through experimental testing. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the prediction horizon determined by this method reduces the computational burden by 10\%-20\% compared to the empirically selected prediction horizon.</description>

      <title>Distributed Matrix Pencil Formulations for Prescribed-Time Leader-Following Consensus of MASs with Unknown Sensor Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of prescribed-time leader-following consensus of heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of unknown sensor sensitivity. Under a connected undirected topology, we propose a time-varying dual observer/controller design framework that makes use of regular local and inaccurate feedback to achieve consensus tracking within a prescribed time. In particular, the developed analysis framework is applicable to MASs equipped with sensors of different sensitivities. One of the design innovations involves constructing a distributed matrix pencil formulation based on worst-case sensors, yielding control parameters with sufficient robustness yet relatively low conservatism. Another novelty is the construction of the control gains, which consists of the product of a proportional coefficient obtained from the matrix pencil formulation and a classic time-varying function that grows to infinity or a novel bounded time-varying function. Furthermore, it is possible to extend the prescribed-time distributed protocol to infinite time domain by introducing the bounded time-varying gain technique without sacrificing the ultimate control accuracy, and the corresponding technical proof is comprehensive. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through a group of 5 single-link robot manipulators.</description>

      <title>A Prototypical Expert-Driven Approach Towards Capability-Based Monitoring of Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervising the safe operation of automated vehicles is a key requirement in order to unleash their full potential in future transportation systems. In particular, previous publications have argued that SAE Level 4 vehicles should be aware of their capabilities at runtime to make appropriate behavioral decisions. In this paper, we present a framework that enables the implementation of an online capability monitor. We derive a graphical system model that captures the relationships between the quality of system elements across different architectural views. In an expert-driven approach, we parameterize Bayesian Networks based on this structure using Fuzzy Logic. Using the online monitor, we infer the quality of the system's capabilities based on technical measurements acquired at runtime. Our approach is demonstrated in the context of the UNICAR.agil research project in an urban example scenario.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning-based Model Predictive Control for Uncertain Interconnected Systems: A Set Membership Identification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel adaptive learning-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme for interconnected systems which can be decomposed into several smaller dynamically coupled subsystems with uncertain coupling. The proposed scheme is mainly divided into two main online phases; a learning phase and an adaptation phase. Set membership identification is used in the learning phase to learn an uncertainty set that contains the coupling strength using online data. In the adaptation phase, rigid tube-based robust MPC is used to compute the optimal predicted states and inputs. Besides computing the optimal trajectories, the MPC ingredients are adapted in the adaptation phase taking the learnt uncertainty set into account. These MPC ingredients include the prestabilizing controller, the rigid tube, the tightened constraints and the terminal ingredients. The recursive feasibility of the proposed scheme as well as the stability of the corresponding closed-loop system are discussed. The developed scheme is compared in simulations to existing schemes including robust, adaptive and learning-based MPC.</description>

      <title>Uninterrupted Maximum Flow on Signalized Traffic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a traffic signal control procedure that allows motorists who travel at a recommended speed on suburban arterial two-way roads with a common cycle-time to make every traffic signal. A road-to-traveler-feedback-device advises motorists how fast they should travel to do this. Signalized arterial roads where vehicles that travel at the recommended speed make every traffic signal are termed Ride-the-Green-Wave (RGW) roads. Left-turn-arounds allow vehicles to turn left from one two-way RGW-road to an intersecting/orthogonal two-way RGW-road while allowing maximum flow on the intersecting RGW-roads. In addition to introducing novel traffic signal control strategies, the methods presented in this paper have implications for: road network design, public transport control, connected and automated vehicles and environmental impacts.</description>

      <title>Improving TAS Adaptability with a Variable Temperature Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal-Aware Scheduling (TAS) provides methods to manage the thermal dissipation of a computing chip during task execution. These methods aim to avoid issues such as accelerated aging of the device, premature failure and degraded chip performance. In this work, we implement a new TAS algorithm, VTF-TAS, which makes use of a variable temperature threshold to control task execution and thermal dissipation. To enable adequate execution of the tasks to reach their deadlines, this threshold is managed based on the theory of fluid scheduling. Using an evaluation methodology as described in POD-TAS, we evaluate VTF-TAS using a set of 4 benchmarks from the COMBS benchmark suite to examine its ability to minimize chip temperature throughout schedule execution. Through our evaluation, we demonstrate that this new algorithm is able to adaptively manage the temperature threshold such that the peak temperature during schedule execution is lower than POD-TAS, with no requirement for an expensive search procedure to obtain an optimal threshold for scheduling.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Efficient Approximation of Data-enabled Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) bypasses the need for system identification by directly leveraging raw data to formulate optimal control policies. However, the size of the optimization problem in DeePC grows linearly with respect to the data size, which prohibits its application due to high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation of DeePC, whose size is invariant with respect to the amount of data collected, via differentiable convex programming. Specifically, the optimization problem in DeePC is decomposed into two parts: a control objective and a scoring function that evaluates the likelihood of a guessed I/O sequence, the latter of which is approximated with a size-invariant learned optimization problem. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on a quadruple tank system, illustrating that the learned controller can reduce the computational time of DeePC by 5x while maintaining its control performance.</description>

      <title>A communication protocol based on NK boolean networks for coordinating collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I describe a digital social communication protocol (Gridt) based on Kauffman's NK boolean networks. The main assertion is that a communication network with this topology supports infinitely scalable self-organization of collective action without requiring hierarchy or central control. The paper presents the functionality of this protocol and substantiates the following propositions about its function and implications: (1) Communication via NK boolean networks facilitates coordination on collective action games for any variable number of users, and justifies the assumption that the game's payoff structure is common knowledge; (2) Use of this protocol increases its users' transfer empowerment, a form of intrinsic motivation that motivates coordinated action independent of the task or outcome; (3) Communication via this network can be considered 'cheap talk' and benefits the strategy of players with aligned interests, but not of players with conflicting interests; (4) Absence of significant barriers for its realization warrants a timely and continuing discussion on the ethics and implications of this technology; (5) Full realization of the technology's potential calls for a free-to-use service with maximal transparency of design and associated economic incentives.</description>

      <title>Expected Time-Optimal Control: a Particle MPC-based Approach via Sequential Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of minimum-time optimal control for a dynamical system with initial state uncertainties and propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) solution framework. We seek to minimize the expected terminal (mission) time, which is an essential capability for planetary exploration missions where ground rovers have to carry out scientific tasks efficiently within the mission timelines in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to convert the underlying stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic, numerically tractable, optimal control problem. To this end, the proposed solution framework combines two strategies from previous methods: i) a partial model predictive control with consensus horizon approach and ii) a sum-of-norm cost, a temporally strictly increasing weighted-norm, promoting minimum-time trajectories. Our contribution is to adopt these formulations into an SCP solution framework and obtain a numerically tractable stochastic control algorithm. We then demonstrate the resulting control method in multiple applications: i) a closed-loop linear system as a representative result (a spacecraft double integrator model), ii) an open-loop linear system (the same model), and then iii) a nonlinear system (Dubin's car).</description>

      <title>Reverse engineering the brain input: Network control theory to identify cognitive task-related control nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human brain receives complex inputs when performing cognitive tasks, which range from external inputs via the senses to internal inputs from other brain regions. However, the explicit inputs to the brain during a cognitive task remain unclear. Here, we present an input identification framework for reverse engineering the control nodes and the corresponding inputs to the brain. The framework is verified with synthetic data generated by a predefined linear system, indicating it can robustly reconstruct data and recover the inputs. Then we apply the framework to the real motor-task fMRI data from 200 human subjects. Our results show that the model with sparse inputs can reconstruct neural dynamics in motor tasks ($EV=0.779$) and the identified 28 control nodes largely overlap with the motor system. Underpinned by network control theory, our framework offers a general tool for understanding brain inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users. A key contribution of our work is the establishment of a general lower bound for the problem using the min-cut capacity of hypergraphs. Additionally, we present the distributed broadcast for quasi-trees (DBQT) algorithm tailored for the unique structure of quasi-trees, which is proven to be optimal. This paper advances both network communication strategies and hypergraph theory, with implications for a wide range of real-world applications, from vehicular and sensor networks to distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Resilient Filtering for 2-D Systems with Asynchronous-Delay: Handling Binary Encoding Decoding with Probabilistic Bit Flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the event-triggered resilient filtering problem is investigated for a class of two-dimensional systems with asynchronous-delay under binary encoding-decoding schemes with probabilistic bit flips. To reduce unnecessary communications and computations in complex network systems, alleviate network energy consumption, and optimize the use of network resources, a new event-triggered mechanism is proposed, which focuses on broadcasting necessary measurement information to update innovation only when the event generator function is satisfied. A binary encoding-decoding scheme is used in the communication process to quantify the measurement information into a bit stream, transmit it through a memoryless binary symmetric channel with a certain probability of bit flipping, and restore it at the receiver. In order to utilize the delayed decoded measurement information that a measurement reconstruction approach is proposed. Through generating space equivalence verification, it is found that the reconstructed delay-free decoded measurement sequence contains the same information as the original delayed decoded measurement sequence. In addition, resilient filter is utilized to accommodate possible estimation gain perturbations. Then, a recursive estimator framework is presented based on the reconstructed decoded measurement sequence. By means of the mathematical induction technique, the unbiased property of the proposed estimator is proved. The estimation gain is obtained by minimizing an upper bound on the filtering error covariance. Subsequently, through rigorous mathematical analysis, the monotonicity of filtering performance with respect to triggering parameters is discussed.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity in laser ultrasound revisited: Is wavefield characterisation by scanning laser excitation strictly reciprocal to that by scanning laser detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common believe about strict measurement reciprocity between scanning laser detection and scanning laser excitation is disproved by a simple experiment. Nevertheless, a deeper study based on the reciprocity relation reveals correct reciprocal measurement set-ups for both the probe-excitation / laser-detection and the laser-excitation / probe-detection case. Similarly, the all-laser measurement, that is thermoelastic laser excitation with laser vibrometer detection, is not in general reciprocal with respect to the exchange of excitation and detection positions. Again, a substitute for the laser doppler vibrometer out-of-plane displacement measurement was found which ensures measurement reciprocity together with laser excitation. The apparent confusion in literature about strict validity/non-validity of measurement reciprocity is mitigated by classifying the measurement situations systematically.</description>

      <title>A Dual Perspective of Reinforcement Learning for Imposing Policy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning methods lack an inherent mechanism to impose behavioural constraints on the trained policies. While certain extensions exist, they remain limited to specific types of constraints, such as value constraints with additional reward signals or visitation density constraints. In this work we try to unify these existing techniques and bridge the gap with classical optimization and control theory, using a generic primal-dual framework for value-based and actor-critic reinforcement learning methods. The obtained dual formulations turn out to be especially useful for imposing additional constraints on the learned policy, as an intrinsic relationship between such dual constraints (or regularization terms) and reward modifications in the primal is reveiled. Furthermore, using this framework, we are able to introduce some novel types of constraints, allowing to impose bounds on the policy's action density or on costs associated with transitions between consecutive states and actions. From the adjusted primal-dual optimization problems, a practical algorithm is derived that supports various combinations of policy constraints that are automatically handled throughout training using trainable reward modifications. The resulting $\texttt{DualCRL}$ method is examined in more detail and evaluated under different (combinations of) constraints on two interpretable environments. The results highlight the efficacy of the method, which ultimately provides the designer of such systems with a versatile toolbox of possible policy constraints.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction of Motion Control Performance for an Automated Vehicle in Presence of Actuator Degradations and Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated driving systems require monitoring mechanisms to ensure safe operation, especially if system components degrade or fail. Their runtime self-representation plays a key role as it provides a-priori knowledge about the system's capabilities and limitations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for deriving such a self-representation model for the motion controller of an automated vehicle. A conformalized prediction model is learned and allows estimating how operational conditions as well as potential degradations and failures of the vehicle's actuators impact motion control performance. During runtime behavior generation, our predictor can provide a heuristic for determining the admissible action space.</description>

      <title>Distributed MPC for PWA Systems Based on Switching ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for distributed model predictive control (MPC) for piecewise affine (PWA) systems. Existing approaches rely on solving mixed-integer optimization problems, requiring significant computation power or time. We propose a distributed MPC scheme that requires solving only convex optimization problems. The key contribution is a novel method, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, for solving the non-convex optimal control problem that arises due to the PWA dynamics. We present a distributed MPC scheme, leveraging this method, that explicitly accounts for the coupling between subsystems by reaching agreement on the values of coupled states. Stability and recursive feasibility are shown under additional assumptions on the underlying system. Two numerical examples are provided, in which the proposed controller is shown to significantly improve the CPU time and closed-loop performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization Using Coordinate Descent Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of online optimization where the objective function is time-varying. In particular, we extend coordinate descent type algorithms to the online case, where the objective function varies after a finite number of iterations of the algorithm. Instead of solving the problem exactly at each time step, we only apply a finite number of iterations at each time step. Commonly used notions of regret are used to measure the performance of the online algorithm. Moreover, coordinate descent algorithms with different updating rules are considered, including both deterministic and stochastic rules that are developed in the literature of classical offline optimization. A thorough regret analysis is given for each case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

      <title>Sequential Rotations and Error Analysis of a Simple Quaternion Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reference [1] introduces a novel closed-form quaternion estimator from two vector observations. The simplicity of the estimator sometimes yields singular expressions, the current annotation provides the simple rotation schemes for four singular cases. The estimator enables clear physical insights and a closed-form expression for the bias as a function of the quaternion error covariance matrix. The latter could be approximated up to second order with respect to the underlying measurement noise assuming arbitrary probability distribution. This note relaxes the second-order assumption, provides an expression for the error covariance that is exact to the fourth order, and a comprehensive derivation of the individual components of the quaternion additive error covariance matrix, under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. It not only provides increased accuracy but also alleviates issues related to singularity.</description>

      <title>SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-Based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate Time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.
