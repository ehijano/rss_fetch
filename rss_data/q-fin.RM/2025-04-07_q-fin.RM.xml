      <title>Model Ambiguity in Risk Sharing with Monotone Mean-Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of an agent who faces losses over a finite time horizon and may choose to share some of these losses with a counterparty. The agent is uncertain about the true loss distribution and has multiple models for the losses. Their goal is to optimize a mean-variance type criterion with model ambiguity through risk sharing. We construct such a criterion by adapting the monotone mean-variance preferences of Maccheroni et al. (2009) to the multiple models setting and exploit a dual representation to mitigate time-consistency issues. Assuming a Cram\'er-Lundberg loss model, we fully characterize the optimal risk sharing contract and the agent's wealth process under the optimal strategy. Furthermore, we prove that the strategy we obtain is admissible and prove that the value function satisfies the appropriate verification conditions. Finally, we apply the optimal strategy to an insurance setting using data from a Spanish automobile insurance portfolio, where we obtain differing models using cross-validation and provide numerical illustrations of the results.</description>

      <title>Systemic Risk and Default Cascades in Global Equity Markets: Extending the Gai-Kapadia Framework with Stochastic Simulations and Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study pioneers the application of the Gai-Kapadia framework, originally developed for interbank contagion, to global equity markets. It offers a novel approach to assess systemic risk and default cascades. Using a 20-asset network (13 Brazilian and 7 developed market assets) from 2015 to 2025, we construct exposure-based networks from price co-movements, applying thresholds theta = 0.3 and theta = 0.5 to capture significant interconnections. Cascade dynamics are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations (n = 1000) with shocks ranging from 10 to 50 percent, complemented by deterministic propagation analysis. Results show that high clustering among Brazilian assets (Ci approx 1.0) leads to localized contagion, with an average of 2.0 failed assets per simulation. In contrast, developed markets with lower connectivity (Ci approx 0.2 to 0.4) show resilience, with zero failures beyond Brazil in all scenarios. Network visualizations highlight structural vulnerabilities: deterministic cascades reach up to 20 assets at theta = 0.3, but only 3 to 4 at theta = 0.5. Risk measures such as VaR and CVaR at 95 percent confidence confirm higher tail risks in emerging markets. This adaptation of the Gai-Kapadia model provides a robust framework for systemic risk assessment. The findings suggest that regulators should target high-clustering nodes in emerging markets, while portfolio managers may benefit from the resilience of developed markets to enhance diversification.</description>
