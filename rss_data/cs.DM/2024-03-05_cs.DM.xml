      <title>Graph drawing applications in combinatorial theory of maturity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tiled graphs as models of learning and maturing processes. We show how tiled graphs can combine graphs of learning spaces or antimatroids (partial hypercubes) and maturity models (total orders) to yield models of learning processes. For the visualization of these processes it is a natural approach to aim for certain optimal drawings. We show for most of the more detailed models that the drawing problems resulting from them are NP-complete. The terse model of a maturing process that ignores the details of learning, however, results in a polynomially solvable graph drawing problem. In addition, this model provides insight into the process by ordering the subjects at each test of their maturity. We investigate extremal and random instances of this problem, and provide exact results and bounds on their optimal crossing number.
  Graph-theoretic models offer two approaches to the design of optimal maturity models given observed data: (1) minimizing intra-subject inconsistencies, which manifest as regressions of subjects, is modeled as the well-known feedback arc set problem. We study the alternative of (2) finding a maturity model by minimizing the inter-subject inconsistencies, which manifest as crossings in the respective drawing. We show this to be NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Payment Scheduling in the Interval Debt Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The network-based study of financial systems has received considerable attention in recent years but has seldom explicitly incorporated the dynamic aspects of such systems. We consider this problem setting from the temporal point of view and introduce the Interval Debt Model (IDM) and some scheduling problems based on it, namely: Bankruptcy Minimization/Maximization, in which the aim is to produce a payment schedule with at most/at least a given number of bankruptcies; Perfect Scheduling, the special case of the minimization variant where the aim is to produce a schedule with no bankruptcies (that is, a perfect schedule); and Bailout Minimization, in which a financial authority must allocate a smallest possible bailout package to enable a perfect schedule. We show that each of these problems is NP-complete, in many cases even on very restricted input instances. On the positive side, we provide for Perfect Scheduling a polynomial-time algorithm on (rooted) out-trees although in contrast we prove NP-completeness on directed acyclic graphs, as well as on instances with a constant number of nodes (and hence also constant treewidth). When we allow non-integer payments, we show by a linear programming argument that the problem Bailout Minimization can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a prime counting problem across the homology classes of a graph, presenting a graph-theoretical Dirichlet-type analogue of the prime number theorem. The main machinery we have developed and employed is a spectral antisymmetry theorem, revealing that the spectra of the twisted graph adjacency matrices have an antisymmetric distribution over the character group of the graph. Additionally, we derive some trace formulas based on the twisted adjacency matrices as part of our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burke and Teng introduced a two-player combinatorial game Atropos based on Sperner's lemma, and showed that deciding whether one has a winning strategy for Atropos is PSPACE-complete. In the original Atropos game, the players must color a node adjacent to the last colored node. Burke and Teng also mentioned a variant Atropos-k in which each move is at most of distance k of the previous move, and asked a question on determining the computational complexity of this variant. In this paper, we answer this question by showing that for any fixed integer k (k&gt;=2), Atropos-k is PSPACE-complete by reduction from True Quantified Boolean Formula (TQBF).</description>

      <title>Weakly modular graphs with diamond condition, the interval function and axiomatic characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly modular graphs are defined as the class of graphs that satisfy the \emph{triangle condition ($TC$)} and the \emph{quadrangle condition ($QC$)}. We study an interesting subclass of weakly modular graphs that satisfies a stronger version of the triangle condition, known as the \emph{triangle diamond condition ($TDC$)}. and term this subclass of weakly modular graphs as the \emph{diamond-weakly modular graphs}. It is observed that this class contains the class of bridged graphs and the class of weakly bridged graphs.
  The interval function $I_G$ of a connected graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ is an important concept in metric graph theory and is one of the prime example of a transit function; a set function defined on the Cartesian product $V\times V$ to the power set of $V$ satisfying the expansive, symmetric and idempotent axioms.
  In this paper, we derive an interesting axiom denoted as $(J0')$, obtained from a well-known axiom introduced by Marlow Sholander in 1952, denoted as $(J0)$. It is proved that the axiom $(J0')$ is a characterizing axiom of the diamond-weakly modular graphs. We propose certain types of independent first-order betweenness axioms on an arbitrary transit function $R$ and prove that an arbitrary transit function becomes the interval function of a diamond-weakly modular graph if and only if $R$ satisfies these betweenness axioms. Similar characterizations are obtained for the interval function of bridged graphs and weakly bridged graphs.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Chordal Circular-arc Graphs: I. Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most elusive problem around the class of circular-arc graphs is identifying all minimal graphs that are not in this class. The main obstacle is the lack of a systematic way of enumerating these minimal graphs. McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a transformation from circular-arc graphs to interval graphs with certain patterns of representations. We fully characterize these interval patterns for circular-arc graphs that are split graphs, thereby building a connection between minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs and minimal non-interval graphs. This connection enables us to identify all minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. As a byproduct, we develop a linear-time certifying recognition algorithm for circular-arc graphs when the input is a split graph.</description>

      <title>Matching Algorithms in the Sparse Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model (SBM) is a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model of random graphs that describes the interaction of a finite number of distinct communities. In sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs, it is known that a linear-time algorithm of Karp and Sipser achieves near-optimal matching sizes asymptotically almost surely, giving a law-of-large numbers for the matching sizes of such graphs in terms of solutions to an ODE. We provide an extension of this analysis, identifying broad ranges of stochastic block model parameters for which the Karp--Sipser algorithm achieves near-optimal matching sizes, but demonstrating that it cannot perform optimally on general SBM instances.
  We also consider the problem of constructing a matching online, in which the vertices of one half of a bipartite stochastic block model arrive one-at-a-time, and must be matched as they arrive. We show that the competitive ratio lower bound of 0.837 found by Mastin and Jaillet for the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi case is tight whenever the expected degrees in all communities are equal. We propose several linear-time algorithms for online matching in the general stochastic block model, but prove that despite very good experimental performance, none of these achieve online asymptotic optimality.</description>

      <title>Minimum acyclic number and maximum dichromatic number of oriented triangle-free graphs of a given order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a digraph. Its acyclic number $\vec{\alpha}(D)$ is the maximum order of an acyclic induced subdigraph and its dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}(D)$ is the least integer $k$ such that $V(D)$ can be partitioned into $k$ subsets inducing acyclic subdigraphs. We study ${\vec a}(n)$ and $\vec t(n)$ which are the minimum of $\vec\alpha(D)$ and the maximum of $\vec{\chi}(D)$, respectively, over all oriented triangle-free graphs of order $n$. For every $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $n$ large enough, we show $(1/\sqrt{2} - \epsilon) \sqrt{n\log n} \leq \vec{a}(n) \leq \frac{107}{8} \sqrt n \log n$ and $\frac{8}{107} \sqrt n/\log n \leq \vec{t}(n) \leq (\sqrt 2 + \epsilon) \sqrt{n/\log n}$. We also construct an oriented triangle-free graph on 25 vertices with dichromatic number~3, and show that every oriented triangle-free graph of order at most 17 has dichromatic number at most 2.</description>

      <title>Approximately Counting Answers to Conjunctive Queries with Disequalities and Negations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of approximating the number of answers to a small query $\varphi$ in a large database $\mathcal{D}$. We establish an exhaustive classification into tractable and intractable cases if $\varphi$ is a conjunctive query with disequalities and negations:
  $\bullet$ If there is a constant bound on the arity of $\varphi$, and if the randomised Exponential Time Hypothesis (rETH) holds, then the problem has a fixed-parameter tractable approximation scheme (FPTRAS) if and only if the treewidth of $\varphi$ is bounded.
  $\bullet$ If the arity is unbounded and we allow disequalities only, then the problem has an FPTRAS if and only if the adaptive width of $\varphi$ (a width measure strictly more general than treewidth) is bounded; the lower bound relies on the rETH as well.
  Additionally we show that our results cannot be strengthened to achieve a fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme (FPRAS): We observe that, unless $\mathrm{NP} =\mathrm{RP}$, there is no FPRAS even if the treewidth (and the adaptive width) is $1$. However, if there are neither disequalities nor negations, we prove the existence of an FPRAS for queries of bounded fractional hypertreewidth, strictly generalising the recently established FPRAS for conjunctive queries with bounded hypertreewidth due to Arenas, Croquevielle, Jayaram and Riveros (STOC 2021).</description>

      <title>Approximation algorithms for job scheduling with block-type conflict graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines (identical, uniform, or unrelated), under incompatibility relation modeled as a block graph, under the makespan optimality criterion, is considered in this paper. No two jobs that are in the relation (equivalently in the same block) may be scheduled on the same machine in this model.
  The presented model stems from a well-established line of research combining scheduling theory with methods relevant to graph coloring. Recently, cluster graphs and their extensions like block graphs were given additional attention. We complement hardness results provided by other researchers for block graphs by providing approximation algorithms. In particular, we provide a $2$-approximation algorithm for $P|G = block\ graph|C_{max}$ and a PTAS for the case when the jobs are unit time in addition. In the case of uniform machines, we analyze two cases. The first one is when the number of blocks is bounded, i.e. $Q|G = k-block\ graph|C_{max}$. For this case, we provide a PTAS, improving upon results presented by D. Page and R. Solis-Oba. The improvement is two-fold: we allow richer graph structure, and we allow the number of machine speeds to be part of the input. Due to strong NP-hardness of $Q|G = 2-clique\ graph|C_{max}$, the result establishes the approximation status of $Q|G = k-block\ graph|C_{max}$. The PTAS might be of independent interest because the problem is tightly related to the NUMERICAL k-DIMENSIONAL MATCHING WITH TARGET SUMS problem. The second case that we analyze is when the number of blocks is arbitrary, but the number of cut-vertices is bounded and jobs are of unit time. In this case, we present an exact algorithm. In addition, we present an FPTAS for graphs with bounded treewidth and a bounded number of unrelated machines.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</description>

      <title>On the hull and interval numbers of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, for a given oriented graph $D$, we study its interval and hull numbers, respectively, in the oriented geodetic, P3 and P3* convexities. This last one, we believe to be formally defined and first studied in this paper, although its undirected version is well-known in the literature.
  Concerning bounds, for a strongly oriented graph D, and the oriented geodetic convexity, we prove that $ohng(D)\leq m(D)-n(D)+2$ and that there is at least one such that $ohng(D) = m(D)-n(D)$. We also determine exact values for the hull numbers in these three convexities for tournaments, which imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute them. These results allow us to deduce polynomial-time algorithms to compute $ohnp(D)$ when the underlying graph of $D$ is split or cobipartite.
  Moreover, we provide a meta-theorem by proving that if deciding whether $oing(D)\leq k$ or $ohng(D)\leq k$ is NP-hard or W[i]-hard parameterized by $k$, for some $i\in\mathbb{Z_+^*}$, then the same holds even if the underlying graph of $D$ is bipartite. Next, we prove that deciding whether $ohnp(D)\leq k$ or $ohnps(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if $D$ is acyclic and its underlying graph is bipartite; that deciding whether $ohng(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if $D$ is acyclic; that deciding whether $oinp(D)\leq k$ or $oinps(D)\leq k$ is NP-complete, even if $D$ has no directed cycles and the underlying graph of $D$ is a chordal bipartite graph; and that deciding whether $oinp(D)\leq k$ or $oinps(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if the underlying graph of $D$ is split.
  Finally, also argue that the interval and hull numbers in the oriented P3 and P3* convexities can be computed in cubic time for graphs of bounded clique-width by using Courcelle's theorem.</description>

      <title>On $(n,m)$-chromatic numbers of graphs having bounded sparsity parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $(n,m)$-graph is characterised by having $n$ types of arcs and $m$ types of edges. A homomorphism of an $(n,m)$-graph $G$ to an $(n,m)$-graph $H$, is a vertex mapping that preserves adjacency, direction, and type. The $(n,m)$-chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{n,m}(G)$, is the minimum value of $|V(H)|$ such that there exists a homomorphism of $G$ to $H$. The theory of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs have connections with graph theoretic concepts like harmonious coloring, nowhere-zero flows; with other mathematical topics like binary predicate logic, Coxeter groups; and has application to the Query Evaluation Problem (QEP) in graph database.
  In this article, we show that the arboricity of $G$ is bounded by a function of $\chi_{n,m}(G)$ but not the other way around. Additionally, we show that the acyclic chromatic number of $G$ is bounded by a function of $\chi_{n,m}(G)$, a result already known in the reverse direction. Furthermore, we prove that the $(n,m)$-chromatic number for the family of graphs with a maximum average degree less than $2+ \frac{2}{4(2n+m)-1}$, including the subfamily of planar graphs with girth at least $8(2n+m)$, equals $2(2n+m)+1$. This improves upon previous findings, which proved the $(n,m)$-chromatic number for planar graphs with girth at least $10(2n+m)-4$ is $2(2n+m)+1$.
  It is established that the $(n,m)$-chromatic number for the family $\mathcal{T}_2$ of partial $2$-trees is both bounded below and above by quadratic functions of $(2n+m)$, with the lower bound being tight when $(2n+m)=2$. We prove $14 \leq \chi_{(0,3)}(\mathcal{T}_2) \leq 15$ and $14 \leq \chi_{(1,1)}(\mathcal{T}_2) \leq 21$ which improves both known lower bounds and the former upper bound. Moreover, for the latter upper bound, to the best of our knowledge we provide the first theoretical proof.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of maximizing the distance to a given point $C_0$ over a polytope $\mathcal{P}$. Assuming that the polytope is circumscribed by a known ball we construct an intersection of balls which preserves the vertices of the polytope on the boundary of this ball, and show that the intersection of balls approximates the polytope arbitrarily well. Then, we use some known results regarding the maximization of distances to a given point over an intersection of balls to create a new polytope which preserves the maximizers to the original problem. Next, a new intersection of balls is obtained in a similar fashion, and as such, after a finite number of iterations, we conjecture, we end up with an intersection of balls over which we can maximize the distance to the given point. The obtained distance is shown to be a non trivial upper bound to the original distance. Tests are made with maximizing the distance to a random point over the unit hypercube up to dimension $n = 100$. Several detailed 2-d examples are also shown.</description>
