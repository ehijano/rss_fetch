      <title>Fortuity in ABJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $1/12$-BPS and $1/16$-BPS cohomologies and the fortuitous mechanism in ABJM theory. We first establish the existence of fortuitous states in the $N=1$ theory, where the theory is abelian and trace relations are extreme. We then provide explicit constructions of fortuitous states at $N=2$. We find fortuitous states both at weak coupling, in direct parallel to what has been done in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, but we also find additional fortuitous states at $k=2$, which is in the strongly coupled regime. The extra fortuitous states that appear at $k=2$ are in non-trivial monopole sectors. A striking distinction from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM is that the fortuitous states appear at much smaller quantum numbers, making them easier to find. Along the way, we formulate a non-renormalization conjecture for cohomologies in ABJM.</description>

      <title>Counting AdS Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 'number' $\mathfrak{N}(\mu)$ of AdS vacua with a UV cut off $ \mu$. It has been proposed that this number is finite. We find evidence that $\mathfrak{N}(\mu)\lesssim a \ \mu^{-b}$ as $\mu \rightarrow 0$ for some constants $a$ and $b$ of $O(1)$ in Planck units that may depend on dimension and the number of supercharges. For this result to hold it is crucial to integrate over the volume of massless and tachyonic directions of AdS which corresponds to the volume of the space of marginal and relevant deformations of the dual CFT. We are led to the surprising prediction that theories with large number of light moduli contribute very little to the volume measure among all theories. We also speculate about the dS case leading to the number of quasi-dS vacua of the order of $\Lambda^{-\alpha}$ for some $O(1)$ parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using twistor string theory, we engineer a gravitational holographic dual of the self-dual sector of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. This provides a top-down example of holography at zero 't Hooft coupling. Our holographic dictionary operates at the level of D-branes wrapping twistor lines and generalizes the D-instanton prescription used to compute scattering amplitudes. As an application, we study the correlators of determinant operators that act as generating functions of half-BPS operators in the self-dual theory. We show that these correlators are dual to configurations of giant gravitons in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative deformations of gauge theories via Drinfel'd twists of the scale symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider gauge theories that are relativistic and scale-invariant, and we construct their deformed versions via suitable star products. In particular, the non-commutative structure is controlled by Drinfel'd twists that are built out of symmetry generators that include the scale transformation. To achieve this, we construct a twisted differential calculus that allows us to identify the proper gauge-covariant quantities. We also show that our construction is equivalent to twists where the symmetry generators are implemented as active transformations of fields. As a consequence of our construction, the deformed gauge theories possess a twisted version of the original symmetry group. Moreover, at the planar level, the deformation is encoded just on the external legs of Feynman diagrams, leaving then the amputated diagrams undeformed. This work extends previous constructions and allows us to define twist-deformations of $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills that are conjectured to be holographically dual to a class of homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$.</description>

      <title>AdS$_4$ Boundary Wightman functions in Twistor Space: Factorization, Conformal blocks and a Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real-time holographic four point Wightman functions involving scalars, photons, gluons and gravitons in the Poincare patch of AdS$_4$. We show that when the momenta of the middle two operators are spacelike, four-point exchange Wightman functions factorize into a product of three-point functions. This expression coincides with a Wightman conformal partial wave corresponding to the operator dual to the exchanged particle in the bulk. Further, we discuss and explicitly show how these results can be analytically continued to obtain Euclidean AdS correlators up to contact diagrams and avoid the need to perform any nested bulk point integrals in contrast to the traditional Witten diagram approach. We then translate our results to twistor space taking first steps towards a twistor space reformulation of four point Wightman functions. For conformally coupled scalars interacting with a cubic potential, we obtain a beautiful form for four and five point functions. For the interesting case of Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity, we derive a simple double copy relation. This is easiest to see when correlators are expressed in twistor space using Schwinger parameterization where the graviton correlator is simply the square of its gluon counterpart.</description>

      <title>Inflation with a Growing Fifth Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation generally assumes a field with nonzero potential that leads to inflationary expansion happening at arbitrarily early times. We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis.</description>

      <title>Entanglement membrane in the Brownian SYK chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that entanglement dynamics in chaotic many-body quantum systems in the limit of large subsystems and long times is described by an entanglement membrane effective theory. In this paper, we derive the membrane description in a solvable chaotic large-$N$ model, the Brownian SYK chain. This model has a collective field description in terms of fermion bilinears connecting different folds of the multifold Schwinger-Keldysh path integral used to compute R\'enyi entropies. The entanglement membrane is a traveling wave solution of the saddle point equations governing these collective fields. The entanglement membrane is characterised by a velocity $v$ and a membrane tension ${\cal E}(v)$ that we calculate. We find that the membrane has finite width for $v&lt;v_B$ (the butterfly velocity), however for $v &gt; v_B$, the membrane splits into two wave fronts, each moving with the butterfly velocity. Our results provide a new viewpoint on the entanglement membrane and uncover new connections between quantum information dynamics and scrambling.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional de-Sitter and deformed CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative dimensional reduction that yields an effective theory of dilatons in a two-dimensional de Sitter background. Specifically, by performing an S-wave reduction of higher-dimensional Einstein gravity, we obtain free massless dilatons in the static patch, and a dynamically evolving dilatons in the past Milne wedge. We then propose a static patch worldsheet formulation in terms of CFTs with SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) deformed Hamiltonians on the cylinder. A key feature of this construction is that a stretched horizon in the static patch, equipped with an emergent UV boundary condition, acts as a gravitating observer. Using the similar reduction, we have also obtained a Schwarzian action coupled to free massless dilatons in the near horizon near extremal limit of four dimensional charged AdS black holes. The worldsheet description for the same has been proposed and discussed in \cite{Das:2025cuq}. We also comment on how different notions of worldsheet time may themselves be \textit{emergent}.</description>

      <title>Entanglement surfaces for rotating cylindrical black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct entanglement surfaces for rotating cylindrical black holes in a double holographic setup, extending previous results to the case of stationary backgrounds. We analyze both the 5d braneworld construction as well as the embedding in 10d type IIB string theory. We couple the rotating cylindrical black hole to a non-gravitating bath, and study island and Hartman-Maldacena surfaces. Properties of island surfaces are characterized by three regimes, bounded by two critical parameters. In addition to the critical value known for the static case, we find that a new one emerges, related to the extremal limit of the rotating black hole. This behaviour is present both for the bottom-up as well as the top-down models, for which we find qualitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Probing Evaporating Black Holes with Modular Flow in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of modular flow on correlation functions of fermions in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model coupled weakly to a bath, which we take to be another SYK model. The system and bath, together are prepared in the thermofield double (TFD) state, and we focus on the effect of modular flow generated by the reduced density matrix for the SYK system, obtained by tracing out the bath. We show, in the late time limit, that modular flowed correlators of two Majorana fermions, single-sided and two-sided, exhibit non-trivial singularities. Beyond a critical value of the modular parameter, the ``modular scrambling time", the singularity structure shows correlations being transferred from one boundary to the other. The calculations are performed by employing the replica trick in Euclidean time and appropriately analytically continuing to real time. Exploiting the connection between modular flow generators and SL$(2,{\mathbb R})$ boosts we use the microscopic picture to reconstruct the dual bulk modular flow in two-sided AdS$_2$ black hole spacetime. Fixed points of the flow allow to identify quantum extremal surfaces (QES) demarcating the entanglement wedge of the boundary system and the island. We show that bulk modular flow can move fermion insertions near the right boundary past the horizon leading to lightcone singularities in appropriately smeared boundary correlators, probing physics beyond the horizon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Algebras with Two Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational algebras on spacetimes with two extremal surfaces. In the example of a long wormhole with two asymptotic AdS boundaries and two compact extremal surfaces, we discuss the assignment of gravitational algebras to various regions bounded by the extremal surfaces and/or asymptotic boundaries. Using the split property, we construct type II algebras from the crossed product in the left exterior, right exterior, the middle ``python's lunch'' region, and their complement regions. We also study the case where only the area sum operator or area difference operator is included as part of the gravitational algebra. This can be achieved by picking the appropriate microcanonical ensemble, and these gravitational algebras can either be type II or type III depending on the region. In the case where we include only the area difference mode, the crossed product gives rise to a weight that restricts to a trace on the middle region. Differences of relative entropies with respect to this weight give differences in generalized entropies. This provides an algebraic understanding of the order parameter that controls the phase transitions between entanglement wedges. We emphasize the role of operator-valued weights used in our construction.</description>

      <title>An Interpretation for the Equivalence of Two Holographic Computations of the Butterfly Velocity with the Canonical Formalism of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the equivalence of two holographic computations of the butterfly velocity: the computation with the shock wave solution and the computation with the entanglement wedge reconstruction. We provide an interpretation for the equivalence of the two computations with the canonical formalism of gravity.
  Specifically, by taking use of the canonical formalism, we reformulate both computations into the ones with a similar form. Here, in both reformulated computations, the butterfly velocity is computed from applying a given set of initial data into the constraint equations. And the sets of initial data of both computations have a similar structure.
  We then interpret the equivalence of the two computations as from the similar form of the reformulated computations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological singularity, conformal anomaly and symmetric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spacetime singularity at $t = 0$ arising in a Kasner-type metric that solves the gravitational equations modified by quantum effects of a conformal field theory (CFT). The resulting constraints can be solved efficiently when expressed in terms of symmetric polynomials. Focusing first on the trace part of the modified gravitational equation, we determine the corresponding solution surfaces in Kasner-parameter space. The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $\eta = A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations. Among the admissible solutions, we identify, in particular, those that develop a curvature singularity while remaining geodesically complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modular Hamiltonian of an interval for the ground state of a massive free scalar field on the half line with Robin boundary conditions, by employing a numerical method. When the interval is adjacent to the boundary, we find numerical evidence that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local, except for the limiting cases of the massless scalar satisfying either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. When the interval is separated from the boundary, the numerical analysis indicates that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local for all these boundary conditions and any value of the mass.</description>

      <title>Instantons meet resonances: Unifying two seemingly distinct approaches to quantum tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of quantum-mechanical tunneling processes, numerous approaches have been developed to determine the decay rate of states initially confined within a metastable potential region. Virtually all analytical treatments, however, fall into one of two superficially unrelated conceptual frameworks: the resonant-state approach and the instanton method. Whereas the concept of resonant states and their associated decay widths is grounded in physical reasoning by capturing the regime of uniform probability decay, the instanton method lacks a comparably clear physical interpretation. We demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches, revealing that the contour-deformation prescription in the functional integral put forward by Callan and Coleman directly corresponds to the outgoing Gamow--Siegert boundary conditions defining resonant states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review and elaborate on the issue of 3d world volume supersymmetry that appears as a residual part of global target space supersymmetry in the BST supermembrane action. While there is no direct ``spinning membrane'' analog of the world-volume supersymmetric spinning string action that could be obtained by coupling $D$ copies of 3d scalar multiplet to 3d supergravity, we discuss how one may construct an $N=1$ 3d supersymmetric analog of the derivative expansion of the bosonic membrane action in static gauge. We compare the resulting $N=1$ supersymmetric action for eight 3d scalar multiplets to the $N=8$ 3d supersymmetric action describing the $D=11$ supermembrane in the static gauge. The two actions are not equivalent which is related to the fact that the full $N=8$ supersymmetry of the static-gauge $D=11$ supermembrane action can be realised only if the fermions are described by an $SO(8)$ spinor rather than vector. The two actions are still directly related in special dimensions $D=4$ and 5. We also compute the one-loop world-volume scattering amplitudes for the two theories, finding that they indeed agree for $D=4,5$ but disagree for $D=11$.</description>

      <title>The Magnus expansion in relativistic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Magnus expansion of the $N$-operator in relativistic quantum field theory, which is related to the $S$-matrix via $S = e^{iN}$. We develop direct methods to compute matrix elements of the $N$-operator, which we refer to as Magnus amplitudes, bypassing scattering amplitudes entirely. At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations. Given that Magnus amplitudes are free of hyper-classical terms, and the known relations between Magnus amplitudes and the radial action, our results lay the groundwork for systematic and efficient calculations of classical observables from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Backgrounds and Background Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with the inclusion of the causal wedge inside the entanglement wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.</description>

      <title>On random matrix statistics of 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that 3d gravity on manifolds that are topologically a Riemann surface times an interval $\Sigma_{g,n}\times I$ with end-of-the-world branes at the ends of the interval is described by a random matrix model, namely the Virasoro minimal string. Because these manifolds have $n$ annular asymptotic boundaries, the path integrals naturally correspond to spectral correlators of open strings upon inverse Fourier transforms. For $g=0$ and $n=2$, we carry out an explicit path integration and find precise agreement with the universal random matrix expression. For Riemann surfaces with negative Euler characteristic, we evaluate the path integral as a gravitational inner product between states prepared by two copies of Virasoro TQFT. Along the way, we clarify the effects of gauging the mapping class group and the connection to chiral 3d gravity.</description>

      <title>On six-loop scaling dimensions of $(\phi^2)^n$ operators in $d=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of singlet operators $(\phi^2)^n$ in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model with $\lambda^2 \phi^6$ interaction. Recently, the corresponding anomalous dimensions $\gamma_{2n}$ were computed by semiclassical methods and the all-loop result for the leading-$n$ corrections in the small $\lambda$ limit was found. In this letter, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for the all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $\gamma_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a region of parameter space where all purely electric, static, dilatonic black holes are unstable within the STU models of maximal supergravity. We show that, for planar black holes, it is possible to complete the thermal phase space with AdS solitons, in such a way that the instability of the black holes signals the onset of confinement in the dual field theory. The analysis is done for the $D=4$ STU model of maximal gauged supergravity which naturally uplift to M-theory on the $S^7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collider signatures of the minimal framework for quark-lepton unification at a scale not far from the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. This theory predicts a rich spectrum of new fields, including one vector leptoquark, two scalar leptoquarks, a color-octet scalar, and an additional Higgs doublet. Neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism, facilitating viable matter unification at the low scale. We find that this theory predicts that in many cases the dominant leptoquark decays are to the third generation Standard Model quarks and leptons. We identify key experimental signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, evaluate and discuss the limits from current measurements, and outline potential strategies for probing this theory in the near future.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a symmetry that enforces every symmetric model to have a Fermi surface. These symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces are realizations of a powerful form of symmetry-enforced gaplessness. The symmetry we construct exists in quantum lattice fermion models on a $d$-dimensional Bravais lattice, and is generated by the onsite U(1) fermion number symmetry and non-onsite Majorana translation symmetry. The resulting symmetry group is a non-compact Lie group closely related to the Onsager algebra. For a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface $\cal{F}$, we show that this UV symmetry group always includes the subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid L$_{\cal{F}}$U(1) symmetry group formed by even functions ${f(\mathbf{k})\in\mathrm{U}(1)}$ with ${\mathbf{k}\in \cal{F}}$. Furthermore, we comment on the topology of these symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces, proving they generically exhibit at least two non-contractible components (i.e., open orbits).</description>

      <title>A new connection between WIMP dark matter and the hierarchy problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a direct link between the hierarchy problem and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): we suggest that the small mass of the Higgs boson arises from being dynamically driven to the scale of the WIMP. Such a special electroweak vacuum is singled out by lying close to the critical boundary of a phase transition, as recently explored in a new class of cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. They generically predict the Higgs potential to be destabilised just above the weak scale. Intriguingly, the requirement for new physics to achieve this coincides with two independently well-motivated expectations: a split spectrum of light fermions and heavy bosons, as anticipated from naturalness, and the so-called "WIMP miracle". A WIMP with mass around the weak scale not only happens to have the correct thermal relic abundance to be the dark matter (DM), it can also give rise to the necessary critical boundary at the TeV scale through its Yukawa couplings to the Higgs. We use a higgsino-like singlet-doublet model to illustrate our Higgs-DM criticality scenario and show that if this WIMP DM mass is observed to be greater than ~1.2 TeV then it necessarily implies a strong bound on the Higgs mass and an upper bound on the scale of heavy new physics that restores vacuum stability. It can be thoroughly probed in direct detection experiments, astrophysical signals and future collider searches, further motivating a comprehensive exploration of the remaining heavy WIMP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Minimal Flavor Protection for TeV-scale New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine how much TeV-scale new physics can deviate from flavor universality, $U(3)^5$, while respecting stringent bounds on flavor-changing neutral currents. The minimal continuous subgroup that must be approximately preserved is identified as $SU(2)_{q} \times U(1)_{X}$. With only a few symmetry-breaking spurions of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, all observed fermion hierarchies may be reproduced, offering a new perspective on the SM flavor puzzle. Remarkably, this framework provides structural flavor protection for generic TeV-scale new physics within the SMEFT, enlarging the space of collider-accessible scenarios beyond MFV and $U(2)^5$ and allowing for richer patterns of flavor violation.</description>

      <title>Deformed LDPC codes with spontaneously broken non-invertible duality symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a well known class of Pauli stabiliser Hamiltonians that furnish fixed-point realisations of nontrivial gapped phases such as symmetry breaking and topologically ordered (including fracton) phases. In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.
  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.
  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric excitation of left- vs right-handed photons in accelerating waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic duality symmetry of Maxwell's equations in vacuum implies that the circular polarization $Q$ of classical electromagnetic waves is conserved. In quantum field theory, the normal-ordered operator $\hat Q$ represents the difference between the number operators of right- and left-handed photons. Previous studies have shown that its expectation value is not conserved for observers propagating in a gravitational field. Here, we show that this Noether symmetry can also be realized in empty waveguides with duality-preserving boundary conditions, and we quantize the source-free Maxwell theory inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. In the vacuum $|0\rangle$ associated to inertial observers, we find that the expectation value $\langle 0| \hat Q |0\rangle $ fails to be conserved for observers co-moving with the waveguide. In particular, frame-dragging effects induce a spectral asymmetry between the right- and left-handed field modes at late times. As a consequence, accelerated detectors co-moving with the rotating waveguide can detect photon-pair excitations from the quantum vacuum, exhibiting an imbalance between opposite helicity modes. This is a relativistic quantum effect, which shows that the classical conservation law associated with duality symmetry is broken in the quantum theory even in flat spacetime, provided we work with non-inertial systems. Our analysis provides a concrete proof of concept for testing this effect in analogue gravity platforms.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Inflation with a Spectator Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron--proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core--crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</description>

      <title>(Pre)-Inflationary Dynamics with Starobinsky Potential in Noncommutative Effective LQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the (pre)-inflationary dynamics of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe governed by the Starobinsky potential within the framework of noncommutative effective loop quantum cosmology. The field equations are solved numerically for various initial conditions and different values of the noncommutative parameter. We analyze the background dynamics for three representative regimes -- the extreme kinetic-energy domination, kinetic-energy domination, and potential-energy domination. A complementary analysis is performed from the viewpoint of dynamical systems, highlighting the qualitative features of the scalar field evolution. Finally, a discussion comparing our results with previous studies employing the chaotic (quadratic) potential in the same formalism is presented.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 3. Constraints on Inflation from Galaxy Power Spectra &amp; Bispectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of cosmic inflation generically predict a weak but potentially detectable amount of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), which can be used to obtain insights into the degrees of freedom during inflation and their interactions. The simplest types of PNG are the local and non-local (equilateral and orthogonal) shapes of the primordial three-point correlators, which are predicted by models with multiple light fields and derivative interactions in single-field inflation, respectively. In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order. Using robust scale cuts where the EFT description is valid, we find the following constraints on PNG amplitudes: $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.1\pm 7.4$, $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=719\pm 390$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-200\pm 100$ (at $68\%$ CL). Non-local PNG constraints can be further improved by combining high-redshift DESI with legacy BOSS data and using simulation-based priors on bias parameters, yielding the strongest large-scale structure constraints to date $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=200\pm 230$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-24\pm 86$. Our constraint on $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}$ is competitive with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) limit; the combination gives $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.0\pm 4.1$, $18\%$ stronger than the CMB only result, which represents the strongest bound on multi-field inflation yet obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of nonrelativistic Proca stars under generic perturbations. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we demonstrate that, as expected, the ground state is always mode-stable. Additionally, we identify several mode-stable spherically symmetric excited states, including stationary states of constant and radial polarization, as well as multi-frequency states in case that the spin-spin selfinteraction vanishes. The existence of stable excited states may have implications for spin-$1$ ultralight dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc as the holonomy of the Hopf fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a simple kinematical model of a disc (Disc B) rolling on the edge of a fixed disc (Disc A) to study the geometric nature of rotation. The total rotation angle $\Delta$ of Disc B after one cycle is decomposed into a dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and a geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The paper's main contribution is to demonstrate that this geometric phase can be essentially described as the $U(1)$ holonomy of the Hopf fibration with the canonical connection. By using a Gauss map to represent the disc's motion as a curve on a two-sphere ($S^2$), the work connects the physical rotation to the underlying geometry of the Hopf fiber bundle $S^3 \to S^2$ and clarifies the origin of the geometric phase.</description>

      <title>Constraining regular primordial black holes with isocurvature gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the constraint on the population of ultra-light regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) by using isocurvature gravitational waves (GW). If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.</description>

      <title>Charged Regular Black Holes From Quasi-topological Gravities in $D\ge 5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of gravity in higher-dimensional spacetime has transitioned from a mathematical curiosity to a fundamental framework in theoretical physics, catalyzed by the dimensional requirements of String theory and M-theory. In this paper, we explicitly construct a spherically symmetric charged black hole solution in $D \ge 5$ dimensions within a gravity theory featuring an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. For a given mass and electric charge, the model admits a unique static spherically symmetric solution. We demonstrate that, with an appropriate choice of coupling coefficients $\alpha_n$, the central singularity is progressively mitigated as the correction order increases, ultimately resolving into a globally regular spacetime in the limit of infinite-order corrections. Furthermore, the criteria for the existence of extremal black holes are determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spatially homogeneous Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universes filled with a massive scalar field in a neighbourhood of the massless transition $s=1$. At this point the Einstein--scalar system exhibits a codimension--two Hopf--steady--state organising centre whose versal unfolding describes all small deformations of the quadratic model. After reduction to the centre manifold, the dynamics is governed by two slow geometric modes $(r,z)$: the Hopf amplitude $r$, measuring the kinetic departure from de Sitter, and the slowly drifting Hubble mode $z$. We show that the standard slow--roll parameters follow directly from these unfolding variables, $\epsilon\sim\tfrac32 r^{2}$ and $\eta\sim z$, so that the spectral tilt, tensor--to--scalar ratio, and scalar amplitude arise as universal functions of $(r,z)$, independently of the choice of potential. The two unfolding parameters $(\mu_{1},\mu_{2})$ classify all perturbations of the quadratic model and can be interpreted physically as controlling the tilt and curvature deformations of generic polynomial inflationary potentials. Thus the near scale--invariance of primordial perturbations emerges as a structural property of the unfolding of the organising centre, providing a potential--independent mechanism for an early phase of accelerated expansion. We discuss the implications of this geometric framework for the interpretation and classification of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Probing false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Probing chiral topological states with permutation defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating "permutation defects" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo II: Chaotic Imprints in Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincar\'e sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework was set up in [1], which allows for the symmetry-preserving inclusion of full quark-gluon vertices in the description of the meson dynamics. In the present work, we develop a special truncation within this approach, which leads to a tractable set of functional equations that satisfy the fundamental chiral Ward-Takahashi identities. Specifically, the truncation allows us to simplify considerably the quark-gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation, without significant loss of quantitative accuracy. Importantly, this implies a substantial reduction of complexity of the renormalized Bethe-Salpeter equation: it is composed by a pair of one-loop diagrams that contain the full quark-gluon vertex, and a single two-loop diagram that is instrumental for the masslessness of the pion in the chiral limit. A detailed numerical analysis reveals that the incorporation of the aforementioned two-loop diagram is instrumental for the corresponding eigenvalue to reach unity. The key relation between the quark mass function and the pion wave function is shown to be satisfied to within the numerical precision of the loop integrals, which is at the level of about one percent or better. The field-theoretic ingredients required for the extension of this analysis beyond the chiral limit are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.
  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is essential for constructing nonsingular cosmological scenarios, such as Genesis cosmology, which avoids the initial singularity by initiating cosmic evolution from an asymptotically Minkowski state. To address theoretical concerns regarding the accumulation of negative energy, the smeared null energy condition (SNEC) has been proposed as a quantum-motivated, semi-local bound on NEC violation. In this work, we examine the implications of the SNEC conjecture for Genesis models, typically constructed within generalized Galileon theories. Our results demonstrate that SNEC imposes nontrivial restrictions on the viability of Genesis models, highlighting the SNEC conjecture as a powerful tool for constraining nonsingular cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards a Fully Automated Differential $\text{NNLO}_\text{EW}$ Generator for Lepton Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future proposed lepton collider experiments will reach unprecedented levels of accuracy. To ensure the success of these experiments, and to fully exploit their wealth of data, the precision of theory calculations must reach comparable or even better levels. One bottleneck in achieving this precision target lies in the systematic, process-independent inclusion of higher-order corrections at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order in the electroweak coupling $\text{NNLO}_\text{EW}$ while ensuring the correct matching with modern all-orders resummation techniques. Here, we present a solution to this problem, based on the Yennie-Frautschi-Suura theorem, which employs a local infrared (IR) subtraction to remove divergences and its matching to an all-order resummation of the soft and soft-collinear logarithms.</description>

      <title>Multipole decomposition of the gravitational field of a point mass at the black hole horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The portion of the gravitational energy absorbed by the black hole due to the radial infall of a point mass is known to diverge at leading order in perturbation theory. This divergence is an artifact of the point-particle model, where the contribution of each multipole to the total absorbed energy is observed to be roughly constant. We show explicitly that this divergent energy arises from the infinite energy present in the singular static field arbitrarily close to the point mass, which also flows into the black hole when the particle trajectory crosses the horizon. We perform a multipole decomposition of the linearized gravitational field generated by the point mass near its world line at the black hole horizon. By applying the standard field-theoretical approach to the particle field, we compute the corresponding partial energy and find that it matches the constant multipole contribution.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics vs Teleodynamics: A Cosmological Divide?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that stationary black holes and the evolving universe belong to fundamentally different thermodynamic regimes: black holes obey ordinary Bekenstein Hawking thermodynamics, whereas cosmology necessarily follows memory-bearing teleodynamics. We show that teleodynamics is not valid for black holes, but is unavoidable in an expanding cosmology. This provides a dynamical, semi-classical realization of the thermodynamic split conjecture and identifies memory accumulation as the natural source of deviations from the area law in cosmology. Our results suggest that quantum gravity should not seek to extrapolate black hole thermodynamics to the universe, but instead must incorporate horizon memory as a fundamental microscopic ingredient and consider cosmological constructions consistent with that.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Black Hole Turbulence: Scalar Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole can redistribute energy among scalar modes and seed turbulent like cascades. We make use of the van der Pol-Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method and derive coupled mode equations that describe near-resonant interactions between neighbouring multipoles. We compare two routes to instability, namely the difference-frequency mixing between adjacent modes and the diagonal (Mathieu) self-modulation channel. We show that, at high multipole number (eikonal limit), the difference-frequency route dominates and drives a one-way cascade from higher to lower frequencies. We chart the corresponding instability regions ("tongues") and quantify their detuning dependence. The framework provides a simple, quantitative mechanism for energy transfer in black hole ringdowns and clarifies when and how turbulent signatures can arise within linear probes on a weakly perturbed background.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ER=EPR from non-local gravitational energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of wormhole geometries supported by the non-local gravitational self-energy that regularizes the particle and black-hole sectors of spacetime. Using this framework, inspired by T-duality, we show that two entangled particles (or particle-black-hole pairs) naturally source an Einstein-Rosen-type geometry in which the required violation of the strong energy condition arises from intrinsic quantum-gravity effects rather than from ad hoc exotic matter, which is matter that violates the null energy condition. We classify the resulting wormholes, analyze their horizons, throat structure and embedding properties, and we identify the exotic energy needed at the minimal surface. Imposing the ER=EPR requirement of non-traversability and the absence of a macroscopic throat, we find that only the zero-throat geometry is compatible with an entanglement-induced Einstein-Rosen bridge, providing a concrete realization of ER=EPR within a fully regular spacetime. Finally, we briefly discuss possible implications for microscopic ER networks from vacuum fluctuations, replica-wormhole interpretations of Hawking radiation, and possible links to entanglement-driven dark-energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Effective delta sources and Newtonian limit in nonlocal gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Newtonian limit of a class of nonlocal gravity models with exponential form factors $f_s (\Box) = \exp [(-\Box/\mu_s^2)^{N_s}]$. Our main goal is to identify similarities and differences between models in this family in regard to weak-field solutions. To this end, we use the effective source formalism to compare the related effective delta sources, mass functions, and Newtonian potentials. We obtain a variety of representations for these quantities in terms of series, integrals, and special functions, as well as simple approximations that capture the relevant dependence on the parameters $N_s$ and $\mu_s$ - which can be used to explore the weak-field phenomenology of nonlocal gravity. We explain why only for $N_s&gt;1$ the Newtonian potential oscillates and prove that, despite the oscillations, the effective masses are positive. Moreover, we verify that these linearized solutions are regular (without curvature singularities). Finally, we also calculate the form of the leading logarithmic quantum correction to the Newtonian potential in these models. In all our considerations, we assume that $N_s$ is a positive real parameter. The cases of non-integer $N_s$ might be applied beyond nonlocal gravity, in effective approaches to implement quantum corrections in the weak field regime.</description>

      <title>Global phase diagram of two-dimensional dirty hyperbolic Dirac liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the canonical nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for spinless fermions, a family of two-dimensional bipartite hyperbolic lattices hosts massless Diraclike excitations near half-filling with the iconic vanishing density of states (DOS) near zero energy. We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$\rho_{a}(0)$] and typical [$\rho_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\{ 10, 3\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schl\"afli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $\rho_{a}(0)$ and $\rho_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $\rho_{t}(0) \to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $\rho_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached.</description>

Abstract: Chiral and non-chiral $p$-form gauge fields have gravitational anomalies and anomalies of Green-Schwarz type. This means that they are most naturally realized as the boundary modes of bulk topological phases in one higher dimensions. We give a systematic description of the total bulk-boundary system which is analogous to the realization of a chiral fermion on the boundary of a massive fermion. The anomaly of the boundary theory is given by the partition function of the bulk theory, which we explicitly compute in terms of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer $\eta$-invariant. We use our formalism to determine the $\mathrm{SL}(2,{\mathbb Z})$ anomaly of the 4d Maxwell theory. We also apply it to study the worldvolume theories of a single D-brane and an M5-brane in the presence of orientifolds, orbifolds, and S-folds in string, M, and F theories. In an appendix we also describe a simple class of non-unitary invertible topological theories whose partition function is not a bordism invariant, illustrating the necessity of the unitarity condition in the cobordism classification of the invertible phases.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a conceptual assessment of some aspects of fundamental quantum field theories of gravity in light of foundational aspects of the swampland program. On the one hand, asymptotically safe quantum gravity may provide a simple and predictive framework, thanks to a finite number of relevant parameters. On the other hand, a (sub-)set of intertwined swampland conjectures on the consistency of quantum gravity can be argued to be universal via effective field theory considerations. We answer whether some foundational features of these frameworks are compatible. This involves revisiting and refining several arguments (and loopholes) concerning the relation between field-theoretic descriptions of gravity and general swampland ideas. We identify the thermodynamics of black holes, spacetime topology change, and holography as the core aspects of this relation. We draw lessons on the features that a field theoretic description of gravity must (not) have to be consistent with fundamental principles underlying the swampland program, and on the universality of the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, focusing in particular on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This approach regularizes the integration over non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces, producing finite results at each order in the expansion, as illustrated by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri-Strominger-Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

Abstract: In supersymmetric theories, protected quantities can be reorganized into holomorphic-topological theories by twisting. Recently, it was observed by Jonsson, Kim and Young that residual super-Poincar\'e symmetries in certain twisted theories can receive higher corrections, turning them into $L_\infty$ algebras with non-strict actions on the twisted fields. In this note, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for the two admissible twists of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Along the way, we discuss in detail the connection between components of physical and twisted fields.</description>

Abstract: Leading quantum effects in perturbative quantum gravity are captured by functional determinants of kinetic operators. We study such 1-loop determinants in three-dimensional Euclidean (anti-) de Sitter gravity evaluated using two seemingly disparate tools, the Selberg zeta function and the Wilson spool. For the Euclidean BTZ black hole, we demonstrate the Wilson spool for massive bosons of arbitrary spin directly equates to a representation-theoretic version of the Selberg zeta function. In the case of Euclidean de Sitter, we show a new trace formula associated with the Fredholm determinant for the scalar Laplacian on the three-sphere reproduces the Wilson spool. Generalizing the trace formula, we comment on how to extend this Wilson spool construction to lens space quotients and higher-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <title>Numerical extraction of crosscap coefficients in microscopic models for (2+1)D conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)-dimensional [(2+1)D] theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality.</description>

      <title>Universality of Heavy Operators in Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large $N$ theories with a gravity dual, generic heavy operators should be dual to black holes in the bulk. The microscopic details of such operators should then be irrelevant in the low energy theory. We look for such universality in the strong coupling limit of a very simple two matrix model -- the Hoppe model. Using analytics as well as Monte Carlo simulations, we show that there exists a universal black hole regime where the eigenvalue densities are given by parabolas and the correlation functions of probes in these backgrounds are completely determined by a few parameters. An important feature of strong coupling in this model is that the matrices commute and one can define joint eigenvalue distributions which also exhibit universality. These two results extend the beautiful findings of Berenstein, Hanada and Hartnoll. Not all heavy operators are universal and at strong coupling there is a sharp phase boundary between the universal and non universal regimes (Of course this should not be confused with the universality of eigenvalue spacing in matrix models). Moreover, in the non universal phase, we also find an interesting phenomenon we call Abelianization where some eigenvalues run off to infinity, reminiscent of heavy dual giant gravitons in $\mathcal N=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>On a 5D UV completion of Argyres-Douglas theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a novel UV completion of a class of Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories in the $\Omega$-background by its embedding into the renormalisation group flow from five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFT) on $S^1$. This is obtained via analysing these theories in the light of ($q$-)Painlev\'e/gauge theory correspondence, which allows to compute the five dimensional BPS partition functions as an expansion in the Wilson loop vev with integer $q$-polynomials coefficients. These are derived formulating the gauge theory on a blown-up geometry and using a five-dimensional lift of (topological) operator/state correspondence. We discuss in detail the phase diagram of the four dimensional limits, pinpointing the special AD loci. Explicit computations are reported for $\tilde E_1$ SCFT and its limit to H$_0=(A_1,A_2)$ AD theory.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping supersymmetric (matrix) quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the quantum-mechanics bootstrap to supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and to its matrix relative, the Marinari-Parisi model, which is conjectured to describe the worldvolume of unstable $D0$ branes. Using positivity of moment matrices together with Heisenberg, gauge, and (zero-temperature) thermal constraints, we obtain rigorous bounds on ground-state data. In the cases where SUSY is spontaneously broken, we find bounds that apply to the lowest-energy normalizable eigenstate.
  For $N = 1$ SUSY QM with a cubic superpotential, we obtain tight bounds that agree well with available approximation methods. At weak coupling they match well with the semiclassical instanton contribution to SUSY-breaking ground-state energy, while at strong coupling they exhibit the expected scaling and match well with Hamiltonian truncation.
  For the SUSY matrix QM, we construct a $44 \times 44$ bootstrap matrix and obtain bounds at large $N$. At strong coupling, we obtain the expected $E \sim \kappa \ g^{2/3}$ scaling of $E$ with $g$ and extract a lower bound on the coefficient $\kappa &gt; .196$. At small coupling, the theory has a critical point $g_c$ where the two wells merge into one. We find a spurious kink at $g = \sqrt{2} g_c$. We attribute this to truncation error and solver limitations, and discuss possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional chaos I: Classical and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multi-dimensional chaos that applies to processes described by erratic functions of several dynamical variables. We employ this concept in the interpretation of classical and quantum scattering off a pinball system. In the former case it is illustrated by means of two-dimensional plots of the scattering angle and of the number of bounces. We draw similar patterns for the quantum differential cross section for various geometries of the disks. We find that the eigenvalues of the S-matrix are distributed according to the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE) in random matrix theory (RMT), provided the setup be asymmetric and the wave-number be large enough. We then consider the electric potential associated with charges randomly located on a plane as a toy model that generalizes the scattering from a leaky torus. We propose several methods to analyze the spacings between the extrema of this function. We show that these follow a repulsive Gaussian beta-ensemble distribution even for Poisson-distributed positions of the charges. A generalization of the spectral form factor is introduced and determined. We apply these methods to the case of a chaotic S-matrix and of the quantum pinball scattering. The spacings between nearest neighbor extrema points and ratios between adjacent spacings follow a logistic and Beta distributions correspondingly. We conjecture about a potential relation with random tensor theory.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <title>Gaillard-Zumino non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover an infinite class of novel zero-form non-invertible symmetries in a broad family of four-dimensional models, studied years ago by Gaillard and Zumino (GZ), which includes several extended supergravities as particular subcases. The GZ models consist of abelian gauge fields coupled to a neutral sector, typically including a set of scalars, whose equations of motion are classically invariant under a continuous group $\mathscr{G}$ acting on the electric and magnetic field strengths via symplectic transformations. The standard lore holds that, at the quantum level, these symmetries are broken to an integral subgroup $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Z}$. We show that, in fact, a much larger subgroup $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ survives, albeit through non-invertible topological defects. We explicitly construct these defects and compute some of their fusion rules. As illustrative examples, we consider the axion-dilaton-Maxwell model and the bosonic sector of a class of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities of the kind that appear in type II Calabi-Yau compactifications. Finally, we comment on how (part of) these non-invertible zero-form symmetries can be broken by gauging the $\mathscr{G}_\mathbb{Z}$ subgroup of invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Group Representations of Lorentz Transformations Extended to Superluminal Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group that includes space-time transformations for observers moving with superluminal relative velocities in arbitrary direction. This extension is generated by a realization of the Klein four group depending on polar and azimuthal angles identifying a spatial direction and is obtained with matrices representing infinite velocity limits of superluminal Lorentz boosts. The resulting group has the same identity component of the whole Lorentz group O(3,1) but involutive operators corresponding to an infinite speed boost and its negative in place of parity and time reversal. Different spatial directions in the definition of Klein group realization give rise to equivalent group extensions. We then define the extended Poincare group including translations and classify its unitary irreducible representations (UIRs). The resulting UIRs are induced from Wigner's UIRs of standard Poincare group and depend on the action of the extended Lorentz group defined on momentum space. UIRs corresponding to non lightlike orbits restrict to the ordinary Poincare subgroup as a multiplicity one direct sum of a massive forward, a massive backward and a tachyonic Wigner UIR while for lightlike orbits as two inequivalent direct sum representations combiningh linearly a forward and backward massless Wigner UIR. We then derive wave equations corresponding to solutions of the Casimir eigenvalue problem of Poincare algebra obtained differentiating the above representations. This set of equations contains all the wave equations known to date in quantum field theory together with new wave equations describing tachyonic behaviour and a new class of massless representations. We finally show that tachyonic wave functions provide a relevant representation theoretic tool for interpretation of parity violation phenomena in quantum field theory</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ Gauge Theories: Mirror Symmetry and Langlands Duality of $A_\infty$-categories of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain why on certain five-manifolds, topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauge theory of Haydys-Witten twist with gauge group $G$, is dual to that of Geyer-M\"{u}lsch twist with gauge group $^LG$, where $G$ is a real, compact Lie group with Langlands dual $^LG$. In turn, via their 2d and 3d gauged A/B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg model interpretations, we can show that (i) a Fukaya-Seidel-type $A_\infty$-1-category of an HW$_4$-instanton Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Fueter-type $A_\infty$-2-category of an HW$_3$-instanton Floer homology of two-manifolds, are dual to (i) an Orlov-type $A_\infty$-1-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{H}}$-flat Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Rozansky-Witten-type $A_\infty$-2-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{O}}$-flat Floer homology of two-manifolds, respectively. We also derive their Atiyah-Floer-type correspondences to symplectic categories. Our work, which demonstrates a mirror symmetry and Langlands duality of (higher) $A_\infty$-categories of Floer homologies, therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and gauge-theoretic generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [1] and Doan-Rezchikov [2], and more.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notion of regularized integrals introduced by Li-Zhou that aims to assign finite values to divergent integrals on configuration spaces of Riemann surfaces. We then give cohomological formulations for the extended notion using the tools of current cohomology and mixed Hodge structures. We also provide practical ways of constructing representatives of the corresponding cohomology classes in terms of smooth differential forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exclusive semi-leptonic decay stands as a pivotal channel in the exploration of heavy flavor physics, primarily due to its straightforward experimental measurability. In this work, we delve into the hadron matrix element and hadron tensor within the context of exclusive semi-leptonic decays. We challenge the conventional exclusive decay theory by introducing a fresh perspective, revealing that while the baryon sector is consistent, the meson sector warrants revision. Employing a novel form factor derived from the Taylor series expansion in our differential width calculations, we demonstrate that fitting experimental data necessitates a more streamlined and minimal parameter set compared to the standard Light Cone Sun Rul(LCSR) form factors. Furthermore, we propose that our hypothesis can be empirically validated or refuted through the precise measurement of the double differential decay width, offering a tangible path forward for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external potential: WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion which presents the simplest case of a soft energy-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains non-perturbative in $\hbar$ correction. This non-perturbative correction, usually associated with tunneling effects or the presence of complex turning points, occurs even for the harmonic potential with quartic dispersion where complex turning points and tunneling are absent. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.</description>

      <title>Self Consistent Thermal Resummation: A Case Study of the Phase Transition in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate description of the scalar potential at finite temperature is crucial for studying cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPT) in the early Universe. At finite temperatures, a precise treatment of thermal resummations is essential, as bosonic fields encounter significant infrared issues that can compromise standard perturbative approaches. The Partial Dressing (or the tadpole resummation) method provides a self consistent resummation of higher order corrections, allowing the computation of thermal masses and the effective potential including the proper Boltzmann suppression factors and without relying on any high-temperature approximation. We systematically compare the Partial dressing resummation scheme results with the Parwani and Arnold Espinosa (AE) ones to investigate the thermal phase transition dynamics in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Our findings reveal that different resummation prescriptions can significantly alter the nature of the phase transition within the same region of parameter space, confirming the differences that have already been noticed between the Parwani and AE schemes. Notably, the more refined resummation prescription, the Partial Dressing scheme, does not support symmetry non-restoration in 2HDM at high temperatures observed using the AE prescription. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties in the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from an FOPT due to variations in resummation methods, illustrating their role in shaping theoretical predictions for upcoming GW experiments. Finally, we discuss the capability of the High-Luminosity LHC and proposed GW experiments to probe the FOEWPT-favored region of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the honeycomb tight-binding model hosts an exact microscopic avatar of its low-energy SU(2) valley symmetry and parity anomaly. Specifically, the SU(2) valley symmetry arises from a collection of conserved, integer quantized charge operators that obey the Onsager algebra. Along with lattice reflection and time-reversal symmetries, this Onsager symmetry has a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly that matches the parity anomaly in the IR. Indeed, we show that any local Hamiltonian commuting with these symmetries cannot have a trivial unique gapped ground state. We study the phase diagram of the simplest symmetric model and survey various deformations, including Haldane's mass term, which preserves only the Onsager symmetry. Our results place the parity anomaly in ${2+1}$D alongside Schwinger's anomaly in ${1+1}$D and Witten's SU(2) anomaly in ${3+1}$D as 't Hooft anomalies that can arise from the Onsager symmetry on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the range of validity of the semiclassical approximation of a quantum master equation designed to describe the $c\bar{c}$ dynamics in a quark gluon plasma at various temperatures, in the quantum Brownian regime. We perform a comparative study of various properties, e.g. the charmonia yield, of the Wigner density obtained with the Lindblad equation and with the associated semiclassical Fokker-Planck equation. The semiclassical description is found to reproduce with a remarkable accuracy the results obtained through the full quantum description. We show that, to a large extent, this can be attributed to the non-unitary components of the dynamics that result from the contact of the $c\bar{c}$ subsystem with the thermal bath, leading to a rapid classicalization of the subsystem.</description>

      <title>Black holes and wormholes in Deser-Woodard gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Deser-Woodard gravity is a modified theory of gravity in which nonlocality plays a central role. In this context, nonlocality is a consequence of the inverse of the d'Alembertian operator $\square^{-1}$ in the effective action. Here, exact black hole and wormhole solutions are built in the revised Deser-Woodard gravity following a recent approach, where a special tetrad frame simplifies the complicated field equations of the theory. Using the Schwarzschild metric and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric as initial seed solutions, the developed algorithm generates new traversable wormholes, singular black holes and a regular black hole as solutions of the vacuum field equations of the modified theory. Also, the auxiliary fields, which are responsible for the nonlocality, are computed. However, even for a regular black hole solution, in which spacetime does not contain a curvature singularity, the corresponding auxiliary fields diverge at the event horizon. Regarding observational results, the shadow angular radius is computed for the new solutions. In particular, the deviation of the Schwarzschild black hole in the Deser-Woodard gravity casts a larger shadow than the corresponding black hole in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals and extra dimensions: Insights from modified Teukolsky framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) offer a promising avenue to test extra-dimensional physics through gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this work, we study equatorial eccentric EMRIs around a spherically symmetric braneworld black hole, focusing on the influence of a tidal charge parameter arising from extra dimensions. Using the fact of tr-symmetry of the spacetime under consideration, we implement the Modified Teukolsky Equation (MTE) framework, incorporating the non-Ricci-flat nature of the spacetime. We compute the relevant observables and perform a comparative analysis with the results obtained from the Dudley-Finley (DF) approximation. Our findings indicate that the constraint on the tidal charge remains nearly the same in both approaches MTE and DF thus supporting previous studies on EMRIs in braneworld scenarios within the DF approximation. Furthermore, the difference in the mismatch between the two formulations exhibits deviations as the orbital eccentricity increases. Therefore, these findings highlight not only the observational potential of future low-frequency detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) but also bring out the effectiveness of the DF approximation as well as the importance of the MTE framework for accurately modeling binaries in theories beyond GR.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interaction that gives rise to gravity, involving chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and it does not invoke relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. SDCs might provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical prediction of the magnitude of the cosmological constant, a justification for why the vacuum does not source gravity, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant weakening over time in agreement with some evidence, certain dark matter effects, and a proposal about how gravity arises from QFT.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>An analytic approach to the stress energy tensor in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a framework for quantum fields in curved spacetimes that possess a stress energy tensor as a connection one form on a suitable moduli space of metrics. In generic spacetimes the existence of such a tensor is thought to be a replacement for the existence of symmetries that the Minkowski theory relies on. It is shown that the local time-slice property and the implementability of local isometries is a consequence of the existence of a stress energy tensor that is a local field. We prove that the Klein-Gordon field, in an irreducible Fock representation in which the ground state is Hadamard, is an example. In this example we show that the scattering matrix for compactly supported metric perturbations exists in the Fock space and is smooth on a dense set with respect to the perturbation parameter. This generalises results by Dimock and Wald.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmological parameters and CMB first acoustic peak in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryon Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16), two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3), and using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Planck likelihood. The results for $H_0$ and $\Omega_M$ in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, $\Omega_D$, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables, thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eisenhart lift is extended to the case of dynamics described by action-dependent Lagrangians. The resulting Brinkmann metric depends on all coordinates. It is shown that the symmetries of the initial dynamics result in the existence of (conformal) Killing vectors of the Brinkmann metric. An example is given of equivalent time- and action-dependent descriptions which result in conformally equivalent metrics. It is also shown how the scaling invariance fits naturally into this scheme.</description>

      <title>Parallel torsion and $G_2, Spin(7)$ instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instanton properties of the characteristic connection $\nabla$ on an integrable $G_2$ manifold as well as instanton condition of the torsion connection $\nabla$ on a $Spin(7)$ manifold are investigated. It is shown that for an integrable $G_2$ manifold with $\nabla$-parallel Lee form the curvature of the characteristic connection is a $G_2$ instanton exactly when the torsion 3-form is $\nabla$-parallel. It is observed that on a compact $Spin(7)$ manifold with $\nabla$ closed torsion 3-form the torsion connection is a $Spin(7)$ instanton if and only if the torsion 3-form is parallel with respect to the torsion connection.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>
