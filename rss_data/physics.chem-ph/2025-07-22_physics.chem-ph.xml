      <title>A universal augmentation framework for long-range electrostatics in machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most current machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) rely on short-range approximations, without explicit treatment of long-range electrostatics. To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization, and Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force training data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with any short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as MACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct systems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on defective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct electrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large and chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing molecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic systems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its short-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts dipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids. By enabling efficient long-range electrostatics without directly training on electrical properties, LES paves the way for electrostatic foundation MLIPs.</description>

      <title>De novo design of alpha-helical peptide amphiphiles repairing fragmented collagen type I via supramolecular co-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchical triple-helix structure of collagen type I, Col I, is essential for extracellular matrix support and integrity. However, current reconstruction strategies face challenges such as chain mismatch, preventing proper fibril formation. Here, we report a supramolecular co-assembly strategy using a de novo-designed alpha-helical peptide amphiphile (APA) of just seven amino acids. The APA features a hydrophobic palmitic acid tail, which stabilizes the helical structure and promotes co-assembly upon interaction with complementary molecular structures. This minimal design enables selective recognition of fragmented collagen (FC), restoring triple-helix conformation and guiding fibre formation. We applied this mechanism to engineer FC-rich nanofat (NF) into a mechanically reinforced biomaterial. Integration of APA-NF with coaxial 3D printing enabled spatial control of structure and function. In a porcine model, this platform enhanced in situ vascularized adipose tissue regeneration. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical reconstruction of collagen via peptide-guided supramolecular assembly offers a promising strategy for soft tissue repair.</description>

      <title>Modeling the coincident three-ion momentum imaging of diiodomethane photodissociation on reduced-dimensional potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient theoretical model to simulate observables in the time-resolved coincident three-ion Coulomb explosion experiment of diiodomethane. The model employs two degrees of freedom to characterize the C-I bond breaking and the $\text{CH}_2\text{I}$ rotation during photodissociation, and three degrees of freedom to characterize the coincident $\text{CH}_2^{+}+\text{I}^{2+}+\text{I}^{2+}$ fragmentation during the following Coulomb explosion. By solving the equation of motion, the photodissociation paths are uncovered on two-dimensional potential energy surfaces of the A-band excited states of the neutral molecule and the asymptotic momenta of the three ionic fragments are obtained on the three-dimensional ground-state potential energy surface of the five-fold charged cation. The photodissociation paths are consistent with previous ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and indicate the $\text{CH}_2\text{I}$ rotational period to be around 340 fs. The theoretical time-dependent kinetic energy release and the correlation between the kinetic energy release and the angle between the two $\text{I}^{2+}$ momenta show good agreement with the experimental signals in parts, which reflects and confirms the static $\text{CH}_2\text{I}_2$ state and the $\text{CH}_2\text{I}+\text{I}$ dissociation channels.</description>

      <title>Electron-Transfer and Exchange-Interaction Model of the Ligand Hyperfine Structure of Alkylated Iron-Sulfur Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) play a wide variety of roles in biochemical processes that are common to all domains of life on earth. The hyperfine structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows how the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our extended approach has the potential to be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Nanoscale Friction on Illite Clay: Effects of Solvent Salt Ions and Electric Double Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quick clay is a highly sensitive soil that transforms rapidly from solid to liquid under minor stress, as a result of long-term salt leaching that drastically reduces shear strength. Stabilizing it is both costly and carbon-intensive, significantly impacting construction emissions in regions like Norway. Developing greener stabilization methods is challenging due to limited understanding of the weakening mechanisms and the specific roles of different salts. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the sliding behavior of illite platelets, the key component in Norwegian quick clay, and how it is affected by the different ions in the solution surrounding the surface. We examine the impact of monovalent (NaCl, KCl, CsCl) and divalent (MgCl2 and CaCl2) salts on platelet-surface interactions, focusing on the friction enhancement brought by divalent salts and how the electric double layer (EDL) structure mediates frictional behavior. We find that divalent cations sit higher on top of the surface, and lead to an increase in friction, while monovalent cations sit closer to the surface. By providing a detailed analysis of these interactions, the study offers a novel framework for understanding the role of salts in clay mechanics and highlights opportunities to design environmentally friendly stabilizers as alternatives to traditional lime and cement.</description>

      <title>New metastable ice phases via supercooled water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water exhibits rich polymorphism, where more than 20 crystalline phases have been experimentally reported. Five of them are metastable and form at low temperatures by either heating amorphous ice or degassing clathrate hydrates. However, such metastable phases rarely crystallise directly from liquid water, making it challenging to study metastable phase relations at relatively high temperatures. Here, we report that high-pressure metastable phases of ice, including two unknown phases named ices XXI and XXII, crystallise directly from liquid water in a deeply supercooled region around the homogeneous nucleation temperature. The key is to use emulsified water to stabilise supercooled water in laboratory timescales. Ices XXI and XXII are obtained by isothermal compression of emulsified water at 295 K and 250 K, respectively. Our powder x-ray and neutron diffraction analyses combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the surprisingly complex structures of these new phases with Z = 152 (ice XXI) and 304 (ice XXII). Ice XXI is topologically identical to 'ice T2' previously predicted by MD simulations, and our experimental structural model can be used as a benchmark for its structures in simulations, which depend on the force fields. On cooling, ice XXI transforms into an orientationally ordered counterpart named ice XXIII. Our results revealed the "hidden" structural complexity of water underlying the phase diagram, as implied by previous computational works. Further efforts at unveiling such metastable phase relations will bridge the large gaps between computational and experimental phase diagrams of water.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved solvation of alkali ions in superfluid helium nanodroplets: Theoretical simulation of a pump-probe study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solvation process of an alkali ion (Na$^+$, K$^+$, Rb$^+$, Cs$^+$) inside a superfluid $^4$He$_{2000}$ nanodroplet is investigated theoretically using liquid $^4$He time-dependent density functional theory at zero temperature. We simulate both steps of the pump-probe experiment conducted on Na$^+$ [Albrechtsen et al., Nature 623, 319 (2023)], where the alkali atom residing at the droplet surface is ionized by the pump pulse and its solvation is probed by ionizing a central xenon atom and detecting the expulsed Na$^+$He$_n$ ions. Our results confirm the Poissonian model for the binding of the first five He atoms for the lighter Na$^+$ and K$^+$ alkalis, with a rate in good agreement with the more recent experimental results on Na$^+$ [Albrechtsen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 162, 174309 (2025)]. For the probe step we show that the ion takes several picoseconds to get out of the droplet. During this rather long time, the solvation structure around it is very hot and far from equilibrium, and it can gain or lose more He atoms. Surprisingly, analysing the Na$^+$ solvation structure energy reveals that it is not stable by itself during the first few picoseconds of the solvation process. After that, energy relaxation follows a Newton behavior, as found experimentally, but with a longer time delay, $5.0\leq t_0\leq 6.5$ ps vs. $0.23\pm0.06$ ps, and characteristic decay time, $7.3\le\tau\le 16.5$ ps vs. $2.6\pm 0.4$ ps. We conclude that the first instants of the solvation process are highly turbulent and that the solvation structure is stabilized only by the surrounding helium ``solvent''.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited-state energies with analytic errors and short time evolution on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately solving the Schr\"odinger equation remains a central challenge in computational physics, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we propose an alternative eigenvalue problem based on a system's autocorrelation function, avoiding direct reference to a wave function. In particular, we develop a rigorous approximation framework that enables precise frequency estimation from a finite number of signal samples. Our analysis builds on new results involving prolate spheroidal wave functions and yields error bounds that reveal a sharp accuracy transition governed by the observation time and spectral density of the signal. These results are very general and thus carry far. As one important example application we consider the quantum computation for molecular systems. By combining our spectral method with a quantum subroutine for signal generation, we define quantum prolate diagonalization (QPD) - a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. QPD simultaneously estimates ground and excited state energies within chemical accuracy at the Heisenberg limit. An analysis of different input states demonstrates the robustness of the method, showing that high precision can be retained even under imperfect state preparation.</description>

      <title>Planted Solutions in Quantum Chemistry: Generating Non-Trivial Hamiltonians with Known Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.</description>

Abstract: Vibrational strong light-matter coupling offers a promising approach for controlling chemical reactivity with infrared microcavities. While recent research has examined potential mechanisms for this phenomenon, many important questions remain, including what type of reactions can be modified and to what extent this modification can be achieved. In this study, we explore the dynamics of Blackbody Infrared Radiative Dissociation (BIRD) in microcavities under weak and strong light-matter interaction regimes. Using a Master equation approach, we simulate the effects of infrared field confinement and vibrational strong coupling on BIRD rates for diatomic molecules. We present a framework explaining how infrared microcavities influence BIRD kinetics, highlighting the importance of overtone transitions in the process. Our findings outline the conditions under which significant enhancement or mild suppression of BIRD rates can be achieved, offering insights into the practical limitations and new strategies for controlling chemistry within infrared resonators.</description>

Abstract: We present tensor-product bitstring selected configuration interaction (TBSCI), the first SCI approach with fully distributed CI vector storage enabled by a tensor-product bitstring representation. Coupled with a novel bitstring-based algorithm and scalable MPI communication strategies, TBSCI handles 2.6 trillion determinants on Fugaku -- doubling the largest full CI calculation and exceeding the previous SCI record by over three orders of magnitude. Based on our bitstring selection, TBSCI achieves near-full CI accuracy with only a tiny fraction of the Hilbert space, establishing a scalable and physically grounded framework for large-scale SCI simulations.</description>

Abstract: The Pekeris coordinates provide a permutationally invariant set of coordinates for H$_3^+$. They are defined as linear combinations of the three internuclear distances that automatically fulfil the triangle inequality for all non-negative coordinate values. In this work, we test three discrete variable representations (DVR) for tightly converging the rovibrational energies up to and beyond the barrier to linearity using the Pekeris coordinates. The best performing representation is a cot-DVR-type approach adapted to the Pekeris problem. The two- and three-proton near coalescence region, which is also part of the direct product Pekeris grid but dynamically not relevant, is avoided by coordinate mapping and regulator functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A total organic aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) employing methyl viologen (MV) electrolyte and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-HO-TEMPO) is tested and characterized under microfluidic conditions. The absence of physical membrane and the quasi-two-dimensional energy transfers occurring in this RFB design enables the first direct measurement of Tafel kinetics, charge transfer, and charge transport resistances for both anolyte and catholyte reactants during the RFB operations. The methodology reported in this work combines spectroelectrochemical imaging and analytical modeling of the periodic mass and charge transfer equations. The Tafel kinetics and charge transfers resistances are measured through several RFB geometries and operating conditions without the need of reference electrode nor absorptivity coefficient calibration, which simplifies the experimental setup, eases the measurements and suppresses the uncertainty related to the electrolyte potential value. Data provided in this work (concentration fields, kinetics properties, electrochemical impedances) quantify the charge transfer in these systems and can serve as reference values for further advanced RFB numerical simulations and design optimization.</description>

Abstract: Currently, the pre-treatment for membrane filtration systems is receiving more attention that can be remove large particles and debris or enhance permeation flux. In this study, commercial nylon 6 fabric is modified via hydrolysis amidation reaction in alkaline media with NaOH and Dimethylene diamine. The increase of hydrophilicity amino groups on the surface of treated fabric which increases the hydrophilicity of the fabric. This opens up new possibilities for the treatment process in commercial membrane filtration systems. Besides, amino enriched nylon 6 fabric can capture carboxylic functionalized carbon-based nanomaterials forwards to the synthesis of thin film nanocomposite membranes based on carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Hidden Relaxation Term in Approximate Treatments of Responses to Electric and Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently a generalization of the ``\textit{modern theory of orbital magnetization}'' to include non-local Hamiltonians (e.g. hybrid functionals of the generalized Kohn-Sham theory) was provided for magnetic response properties. Results indicated inequivalence between sampling of direct and reciprocal spaces for those calculations far from the complete basis set limit. We show that this can be explained by a hidden ``relaxation'' contribution to the reciprocal-space derivatives. The missing relaxation term is shown to (generally) affect the results of calculations of not only magnetic, but also electric response properties, within the context of the ``\textit{modern theory of polarization}''. Necessary conditions are provided to permit avoiding the calculation of the hidden relaxation term.</description>

      <title>Material properties of biomolecular condensates emerge from nanoscale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Chemputer and Chemputation -- A Universal Chemical Compound Synthesis Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemputation reframes synthesis as the programmable execution of reaction code on a universally re-configurable hardware graph. Here we prove that a chemputer equipped with a finite, but extensible, set of reagents, catalysts and process conditions, together with a chempiler that maps reaction graphs onto hardware, is universal: it can generate any stable, isolable molecule in finite time and in analytically detectable quantity, provided real-time error correction keeps the per-step fidelity above the threshold set by the molecule's assembly index. The proof is constructed by casting the platform as a Chemical Synthesis Turing Machine (CSTM). The CSTM formalism supplies (i) an eight-tuple state definition that unifies reagents, process variables (including catalysts) and tape operations; (ii) the Universal Chemputation Principle; and (iii) a dynamic-error-correction routine ensuring fault tolerant execution. Linking this framework to assembly theory strengthens the definition of a molecule by demanding practical synthesizability and error correction becomes a prerequisite for universality. We validate the abstraction against &gt;100 \c{hi}DL programs executed on a modular chemputer rigs spanning single step to multi-step routes. Mapping each procedure onto CSTM shows that the cumulative number of unit operations grows linearly with synthetic depth. Together, these results elevate chemical synthesis to the status of a general computation: algorithms written in \c{hi}DL are compiled to hardware, executed with closed-loop correction, and produce verifiable molecular outputs. By formalising chemistry in this way, the chemputer offers a path to shareable, executable chemical code, interoperable hardware ecosystems, and ultimately a searchable, provable atlas of chemical space.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mixed Steklov-Neumann spectral problem for the modified Helmholtz equation in a bounded domain when the Steklov condition is imposed on a connected subset of the smooth boundary. In order to deduce the asymptotic behavior in the limit when the size of the subset goes to zero, we reformulate the original problem in terms of an integral operator whose kernel is the restriction of a suitable Green's function (or pseudo-Green's function) to the subset. Its singular behavior on the boundary yields the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Steklov-Neumann problem. While this analysis remains at a formal level, it is supported by extensive numerical results for two basic examples: an arc on the boundary of a disk and a spherical cap on the boundary of a ball. Solving the original Steklov-Neumann problem numerically in these domains, we validate the asymptotic formulas and reveal their high accuracy, even when the subset is not small. A straightforward application of these spectral results to first-passage processes and diffusion-controlled reactions is presented. We revisit the small-target limit of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets. The effect of multiple failed reaction attempts is quantified by a universal function for the whole range of reactivities. Moreover, we extend these results to more sophisticated surface reactions that go beyond the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a cost-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 102 pg to 355 pg. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates were identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 12 to 165x faster than r$^2$SCAN10</description>
