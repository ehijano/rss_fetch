      <title>GLOBE: A High-quality English Corpus with Global Accents for Zero-shot Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces GLOBE, a high-quality English corpus with worldwide accents, specifically designed to address the limitations of current zero-shot speaker adaptive Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems that exhibit poor generalizability in adapting to speakers with accents. Compared to commonly used English corpora, such as LibriTTS and VCTK, GLOBE is unique in its inclusion of utterances from 23,519 speakers and covers 164 accents worldwide, along with detailed metadata for these speakers. Compared to its original corpus, i.e., Common Voice, GLOBE significantly improves the quality of the speech data through rigorous filtering and enhancement processes, while also populating all missing speaker metadata. The final curated GLOBE corpus includes 535 hours of speech data at a 24 kHz sampling rate. Our benchmark results indicate that the speaker adaptive TTS model trained on the GLOBE corpus can synthesize speech with better speaker similarity and comparable naturalness than that trained on other popular corpora. We will release GLOBE publicly after acceptance. The GLOBE dataset is available at https://globecorpus.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Speech Emotion Recognition under Resource Constraints with Data Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction. The emergence of edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) presents challenges in constructing intricate deep learning models due to constraints in memory and computational resources. Moreover, emotional speech data often contains private information, raising concerns about privacy leakage during the deployment of SER models. To address these challenges, we propose a data distillation framework to facilitate efficient development of SER models in IoT applications using a synthesised, smaller, and distilled dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that the distilled dataset can be effectively utilised to train SER models with fixed initialisation, achieving performances comparable to those developed using the original full emotional speech dataset.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Techniques in Automatic Music Transcription: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) emerges as a central challenge, aiming to convert audio signals into symbolic notations like musical notes or sheet music. This systematic review accentuates the pivotal role of AMT in music signal analysis, emphasizing its importance due to the intricate and overlapping spectral structure of musical harmonies. Through a thorough examination of existing machine learning techniques utilized in AMT, we explore the progress and constraints of current models and methodologies. Despite notable advancements, AMT systems have yet to match the accuracy of human experts, largely due to the complexities of musical harmonies and the need for nuanced interpretation. This review critically evaluates both fully automatic and semi-automatic AMT systems, emphasizing the importance of minimal user intervention and examining various methodologies proposed to date. By addressing the limitations of prior techniques and suggesting avenues for improvement, our objective is to steer future research towards fully automated AMT systems capable of accurately and efficiently translating intricate audio signals into precise symbolic representations. This study not only synthesizes the latest advancements but also lays out a road-map for overcoming existing challenges in AMT, providing valuable insights for researchers aiming to narrow the gap between current systems and human-level transcription accuracy.</description>

      <title>Speech Prefix-Tuning with RNNT Loss for Improving LLM Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on addressing the constraints faced when applying LLMs to ASR. Recent works utilize prefixLM-type models, which directly apply speech as a prefix to LLMs for ASR. We have found that optimizing speech prefixes leads to better ASR performance and propose applying RNNT loss to perform speech prefix-tuning. This is a simple approach and does not increase the model complexity or alter the inference pipeline. We also propose language-based soft prompting to further improve with frozen LLMs. Empirical analysis on realtime testset from 10 Indic languages demonstrate that our proposed speech prefix-tuning yields improvements with both frozen and fine-tuned LLMs. Our recognition results on an average of 10 Indics show that the proposed prefix-tuning with RNNT loss results in a 12\% relative improvement in WER over the baseline with a fine-tuned LLM. Our proposed approches with the frozen LLM leads to a 31\% relative improvement over basic soft-prompting prefixLM.</description>

      <title>The Greek podcast corpus: Competitive speech models for low-resourced languages with weakly supervised data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of speech technologies for languages with limited digital representation poses significant challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of available data. This issue is exacerbated in the era of large, data-intensive models. Recent research has underscored the potential of leveraging weak supervision to augment the pool of available data. In this study, we compile an 800-hour corpus of Modern Greek from podcasts and employ Whisper large-v3 to generate silver transcriptions. This corpus is utilized to fine-tune our models, aiming to assess the efficacy of this approach in enhancing ASR performance. Our analysis spans 16 distinct podcast domains, alongside evaluations on established datasets for Modern Greek. The findings indicate consistent WER improvements, correlating with increases in both data volume and model size. Our study confirms that assembling large, weakly supervised corpora serves as a cost-effective strategy for advancing speech technologies in under-resourced languages.</description>

      <title>ESC: Efficient Speech Coding with Cross-Scale Residual Vector Quantized Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs aim to compress input signals into minimal bits while maintaining content quality in a low-latency manner. However, existing codecs often trade computational complexity for reconstruction performance. These codecs primarily use convolutional blocks for feature transformation layers, which are not inherently suited for capturing the local redundancies in speech signals. To compensate, they require either adversarial discriminators or a large number of model parameters to enhance audio quality. In response to these challenges, we introduce the Efficient Speech Codec (ESC), a lightweight, parameter-efficient speech codec based on a cross-scale residual vector quantization scheme and transformers. Our model employs mirrored hierarchical window transformer blocks and performs step-wise decoding from coarse-to-fine feature representations. To enhance bitrate efficiency, we propose a novel combination of vector quantization techniques along with a pre-training paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ESC can achieve high-fidelity speech reconstruction with significantly lower complexity, making it a promising alternative to existing convolutional audio codecs.</description>

      <title>DASB -- Discrete Audio and Speech Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete audio tokens have recently gained considerable attention for their potential to connect audio and language processing, enabling the creation of modern multimodal large language models. Ideal audio tokens must effectively preserve phonetic and semantic content along with paralinguistic information, speaker identity, and other details. While several types of audio tokens have been recently proposed, identifying the optimal tokenizer for various tasks is challenging due to the inconsistent evaluation settings in existing studies. To address this gap, we release the Discrete Audio and Speech Benchmark (DASB), a comprehensive leaderboard for benchmarking discrete audio tokens across a wide range of discriminative tasks, including speech recognition, speaker identification and verification, emotion recognition, keyword spotting, and intent classification, as well as generative tasks such as speech enhancement, separation, and text-to-speech. Our results show that, on average, semantic tokens outperform compression tokens across most discriminative and generative tasks. However, the performance gap between semantic tokens and standard continuous representations remains substantial, highlighting the need for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Automatic Sound Event Detection and Classification of Great Ape Calls Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to automatically detect and classify great ape calls from continuous raw audio recordings collected during field research. Our method leverages deep pretrained and sequential neural networks, including wav2vec 2.0 and LSTM, and is validated on three data sets from three different great ape lineages (orangutans, chimpanzees, and bonobos). The recordings were collected by different researchers and include different annotation schemes, which our pipeline preprocesses and trains in a uniform fashion. Our results for call detection and classification attain high accuracy. Our method is aimed to be generalizable to other animal species, and more generally, sound event detection tasks. To foster future research, we make our pipeline and methods publicly available.</description>

      <title>GenDistiller: Distilling Pre-trained Language Models based on an Autoregressive Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained speech language models such as HuBERT and WavLM leverage unlabeled speech data for self-supervised learning and offer powerful representations for numerous downstream tasks. Despite the success of these models, their high requirements for memory and computing resource hinder their application on resource restricted devices. Therefore, this paper introduces GenDistiller, a novel knowledge distillation framework which generates the hidden representations of the pre-trained teacher model directly by a much smaller student network. The proposed method takes the previous hidden layer as history and implements a layer-by-layer prediction of the teacher model autoregressively. Experiments on SUPERB reveal the advantage of GenDistiller over the baseline distilling method without an autoregressive framework, with 33% fewer parameters, similar time consumption and better performance on most of the SUPERB tasks. Ultimately, the proposed GenDistiller reduces the size of WavLM by 82%.</description>

      <title>SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model for Audio-Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task holds significant potential for applications. Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal input of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging. Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are reduced by 78.12\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\%. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current major methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.</description>
