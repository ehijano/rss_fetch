      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling dynamic heterogeneity in supercooled liquids from structural information is one of the grand challenges of physics. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach based on a time-lagged autoencoder (TAE) to elucidate the effect of structural features on the long-term dynamics of supercooled liquids. The TAE uses an autoencoder to reconstruct features at time $t + \Delta t$ from input features at time $t$ for individual particles, and the resulting latent space variables are considered as order parameters. In the Kob-Andersen system, with a $\Delta t$ about a thousand times smaller than the relaxation time, the TAE order parameter exhibits a remarkable correlation with the long-time propensity. We find that short-range radial features correlate with the short-time dynamics, and medium-range radial features correlate with the long-time dynamics. This shows that fluctuations of medium-range structural features contain sufficient information about the long-time dynamic heterogeneity, consistent with some theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Inducing a Metal-Insulator Transition through Systematic Alterations of Local Rewriting Rules in a Quantum Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Anderson localization transition in quantum graphs has garnered significant recent attention due to its relevance to many-body localization studies. Typically, graphs are constructed using top-down methods. Here, we explore a bottom-up approach, employing a simple local rewriting rule to construct the graph. Through the use of ratio statistics for the energy spectrum and Kullback-Leibler divergence correlations for the eigenstates, numerical analysis demonstrates that slight adjustments to the rewriting rule can induce a transition from a localized to an extended quantum phase. This extended state exhibits non-ergodic behavior, akin to the non-ergodic extended phase observed in the Porter-Rosenzweig model and suggested for many-body localization. Thus, by adapting straightforward local rewriting rules, it becomes feasible to assemble complex graphs from which desired global quantum phases emerge. This approach holds promise for numerical investigations and could be implemented in building optical realizations of complex networks using optical fibers and beam splitters.</description>

      <title>An intriguing connection between the Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon and 2+p spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish a close connection between the Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon and a p=2+3 spin-glass model with sextic confinement potential. This is made possible by the unconventional power-counting induced by the effective kinetics provided by the disorder coupling in the large $N$-limit. Because of the absence of epsilon expansion, our approach is more attractive than the previous one and plays a relevant role in the signal detection issue in nearly continuous spectra.</description>

      <title>Level-Set Percolation of Gaussian Random Fields on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit solution of the problem of level-set percolation for multivariate Gaussians defined in terms of weighted graph Laplacians on complex networks. The solution requires an analysis of the heterogeneous micro-structure of the percolation problem, i.e., a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. This is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach. It can be evaluated, both for single large instances of locally tree-like graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of $\mathbb Z_n$-symmetric non-Hermitian models of Baxter was shown by Fendley to be exactly solvable via a parafermionic generalization of the Clifford algebra. We study these models with spatially random couplings, and obtain several exact results on thermodynamic singularities as the distributions of couplings are varied. We find that these singularities, independent of $n$, are identical to those in the random transverse-field Ising chain; correspondingly the models host infinite-randomness critical points. Similarities in structure to exact methods for random Ising models, a strong-disorder renormalization group, and generalizations to other models with free spectra, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Incoherent non-Hermitian skin effect in photonic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the concentration of an extensive number of eigenstates near the boundaries of certain dissipative systems. This phenomenon has raised a huge interest in different areas of physics, including photonics, deeply expanding our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and opening up new avenues in both fundamental and applied aspects of topological phenomena. The skin effect has been associated to a nontrivial point-gap spectral topology and has been experimentally demonstrated in a variety of synthetic matter systems, including photonic lattices. In most of physical models exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect full or partial wave coherence is generally assumed. Here we push the concept of skin effect into the fully incoherent regime and show that rather generally (but not universally) the non-Hermitian skin effect persists under dephasing dynamics. The results are illustrated by considering incoherent light dynamics in non-Hermitian photonic quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Robust Anderson transition in non-Hermitian photonic quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization, i.e. the suppression of diffusion in lattices with random or incommensurate disorder, is a fragile interference phenomenon which is spoiled out in the presence of dephasing effects or fluctuating disorder. As a consequence, Anderson localization-delocalization phase transitions observed in Hermitian systems, such as in one-dimensional quasicrystals when the amplitude of the incommensurate potential is increased above a threshold, are washed out when dephasing effects are included. Here we consider localization-delocalization spectral phase transitions occurring in non-Hermitian quasicrystals with local incommensurate gain and loss, and show that, contrary to the Hermitian case, the non-Hermitian phase transition is robust against dephasing effects. The results are illustrated by considering synthetic quasicrystals in photonic mesh lattices.</description>

      <title>Theory of local $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers for finite and periodic two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological phases of two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric insulators are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant. Usually, the invariant is introduced and calculated by exploiting the way time-reversal symmetry acts in reciprocal space, hence implicitly assuming periodicity and homogeneity. Here, we introduce two space-resolved $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers that are able to probe the local topology of the ground-state electronic structure also in the case of inhomogeneous and finite systems. The first approach leads to a generalized local spin-Chern marker, that usually remains well-defined also when the perpendicular component of the spin, $S_{z}$, is not conserved. The second marker is solely based on time-reversal symmetry, hence being more general. We validate our markers on the Kane-Mele model both in periodic and open boundary conditions, also in presence of disorder and including topological/trivial heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Quantized perfect transmission in graphene nanoribbons with random hollow adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impurities exist inevitably in two-dimensional materials as they spontaneously adsorb onto the surface during fabrication, usually exerting detrimental effects on electronic transport. Here, we focus on a special type of impurities that preferentially adsorb onto the hollow regions of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), and study how they affect the quantum transport in GNRs. Contrary to previous knowledge that random adatoms should localize electrons, the so-called Anderson localization, noteworthy quantized conductance peaks (QCPs) are observed at specific electron energies. These QCPs are remarkably robust against variations in system size, GNR edge, and adatom properties, and they can reappear at identical energies following an arithmetic sequence of device width. Further investigation of wavefunction reveals a unique transport mode at each QCP energy which transmits through disordered GNRs reflectionlessly, while all the others become fully Anderson localized, indicating the survival of quantum ballistic transport in the localized regime. Our findings highlight the potential utility of hollow adatoms as a powerful tool to manipulate the conductivity of GNRs, and deepen the understanding of the interplay between impurities and graphene.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Kinetics for Exploring Diffusion Multiplicity and Chemical Ordering in Compositionally Complex Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion involving atom transport from one location to another governs many important processes and behaviors such as precipitation and phase nucleation. Local chemical complexity in compositionally complex alloys poses challenges for modeling atomic diffusion and the resulting formation of chemically ordered structures. Here, we introduce a neural network kinetics (NNK) scheme that predicts and simulates diffusion-induced chemical and structural evolution in complex concentrated chemical environments. The framework is grounded on efficient on-lattice structure and chemistry representation combined with neural networks, enabling precise prediction of all path-dependent migration barriers and individual atom jumps. Using this method, we study the temperature-dependent local chemical ordering in a refractory Nb-Mo-Ta alloy and reveal a critical temperature at which the B2 order reaches a maximum. Our atomic jump randomness map exhibits the highest diffusion heterogeneity (multiplicity) in the vicinity of this characteristic temperature, which is closely related to chemical ordering and B2 structure formation. The scalable NNK framework provides a promising new avenue to exploring diffusion-related properties in the vast compositional space within which extraordinary properties are hidden.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a generalized interpolating Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Fibonacci (IAAF) model with p-wave superconducting pairing. In the Aubry-Andr\'{e} limit, we demonstrate that the system experiences transitions from a pure phase, either extended or critical, to a variety of intermediate phases and ultimately enters a localized phase with increasing potential strength. These intermediate phases include those with coexisting extended and localized states, extended and critical states, localized and critical states and a mix of extended, critical and localized states. Each intermediate phase exhibits at least one type of mobility edge separating different states. As the system approaches the Fibonacci limit, both the extended and localized phases diminish, and the system tends towards a critical phase.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a powerful formalism, disordered collective dynamics using truncated equations (d-CUT-E), to simulate the ultrafast quantum dynamics of molecular polaritons in the collective strong coupling regime, where a disordered ensemble of $N\gg10^{6}$ molecules couples to a cavity mode. Notably, we can capture this dynamics with a cavity hosting a single \textit{effective} molecule with $\sim N_{bins}$ electronic states, where $N_{bins}\ll N$ is the number of bins discretizing the disorder distribution. Using d-CUT-E we conclude that strong coupling, as evaluated from linear optical spectra, can be a poor proxy for polariton chemistry. For highly disordered ensembles, total reaction yield upon broadband excitation is identical to that outside of the cavity, while narrowband excitation produces distinct reaction yields solely due to differences in the initial states prepared prior to the reaction.</description>

      <title>Similarity between a many-body quantum avalanche model and the ultrametric random matrix model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of ergodicity-breaking phases, it has been recognized that quantum avalanches can destabilize many-body localization at a wide range of disorder strengths. This has in particular been demonstrated by the numerical study of a toy model, sometimes simply called the "avalanche model" or the "quantum sun model" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 060602 (2022)], which consists of an ergodic seed coupled to a perfectly localized material. In this paper, we connect this toy model to a well-studied model in random matrix theory, the ultrametric ensemble. We conjecture that the models share the following features. 1) The location of the critical point may be predicted sharply by analytics. 2) On the localized site, both models exhibit Fock space localization. 3) There is a manifold of critical points. On the critical manifold, the eigenvectors exhibit nontrivial multifractal behaviour that can be tuned by moving on the manifold. 4) The spectral statistics at criticality is intermediate between Poisson statistics and random matrix statistics, also tunable on the critical manifold. We confirm numerically these properties.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous assembly of condensate networks during the demixing of structured fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation, whereby two liquids spontaneously demix, is ubiquitous in industrial, environmental, and biological processes. While isotropic fluids are known to condense into spherical droplets in the binodal region, these dynamics are poorly understood for structured fluids. Here, we report the novel observation of condensate networks, which spontaneously assemble during the demixing of a mesogen from a solvent. Condensing mesogens form rapidly-elongating filaments, rather than spheres, to relieve distortion of a simultaneously-forming internal smectic mesophase. As filaments densify, they collapse into bulged discs, lowering the elastic free energy. Additional distortion is relieved by retraction of filaments into the bulged discs, which are straightened under tension to form a ramified network. Understanding and controlling these dynamics may provide new avenues to direct pattern formation or template materials.</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved U(1) charge, whose basic degrees of freedom are canonical bosons. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- the first microscopic model that realizes the near-CFT$_1$ dynamics -- is based on random $p$-local interactions among fermions. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Our construction is based on a recent insight that near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. All such models are essentially solved by chord diagrams regardless of the nature of the underlying degrees of freedom. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from. We also show the level statistics of both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energies.</description>
