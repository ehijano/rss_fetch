      <title>The disappearance of a massive star marking the birth of a black hole in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar mass black holes are formed from the terminal collapse of massive stars if the ensuing neutrino shock is unable to eject the stellar envelope. Direct observations of black hole formation remain inconclusive. We report observations of M31-2014-DS1, a massive, hydrogen-depleted supergiant in the Andromeda galaxy identified via a mid-infrared brightening in 2014. Its total luminosity remained nearly constant for the subsequent thousand days, before fading dramatically over the next thousand days by $\gtrsim 10\times$ and $\gtrsim 10^4\times$ in total and visible light, respectively. Together with the lack of a detected optical outburst, the observations are explained by the fallback of the stellar envelope into a newly formed black hole, moderated by the injection of a $\sim 10^{48}$ erg shock. Unifying these observations with a candidate in NGC 6946, we present a concordant picture for the birth of stellar mass black holes from stripped massive stars.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diffusion: A Causality-Preserving Model for Cosmic Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a brand-new formalism for the propagation of relativistic cosmic ray (CR) particles. The propagation of CRs has often been described using the diffusion approximation, which has the drawback that the propagation speed of CRs near the source exceeds the speed of light. By applying the analytic solution of the time-dependent distribution function of photons propagating while undergoing scattering, which we recently proposed, we have succeeded in formulating the propagation of relativistic CRs while preserving causality. The obtained formulae give correct expressions both in the diffusion regime and ballistic regime, as well as the transition between them. They can be applied to the propagation of PeV CRs around their sources (PeVatrons), the propagation of ultra-high energy CRs, and the description of TeV gamma-ray halos around pulsars.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Supernova Remnants Using Multiepoch Maximum Likelihood Estimation: Chandra Observation of Cassiopeia A as an Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decadal changes in a nearby supernova remnant (SNR) were analyzed using a multiepoch maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. To achieve greater accuracy in capturing the dynamics of SNRs, kinematic features and point-spread function effects were integrated into the MLE framework. Using Cassiopeia A as a representative example, data obtained by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2000, 2009, and 2019 were utilized. The proposed multiepoch MLE was qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of various motions, including shock waves and faint features, across all regions. To investigate asymmetric structures, such as singular components that deviate from the direction of expansion, the MLE method was extended to combine multiple computational domains and classify kinematic properties using the $k$-means algorithm. This approach allowed for the mapping of different physical states onto the image, and one classified component was suggested to interact with circumstellar material by comparison with infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope. Thus, this technique will help quantify the dynamics of SNRs and discover their unique evolution.</description>

      <title>PS1-11aop: Probing the Mass Loss History of a Luminous Interacting Supernova Prior to its Final Eruption with Multi-wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous interacting supernovae are a class of stellar explosions whose progenitors underwent vigorous mass loss in the years prior to core-collapse. While the mechanism by which this material is ejected is still debated, obtaining the full density profile of the circumstellar medium (CSM) could reveal more about this process. Here, we present an extensive multi-wavelength study of PS1-11aop, a luminous and slowly declining Type IIn SN discovered by the PanSTARRS Medium Deep Survey. PS1-11aop had a peak r-band magnitude of $-$20.5\,mag, a total radiated energy $&gt;$ 8$\times$10$^{50}$\,erg, and it exploded near the center of a star-forming galaxy with super-solar metallicity. We obtained multiple detections at the location of PS1-11aop in the radio and X-ray bands between 4 and 10\,years post-explosion, and if due to the SN, it is one of the most luminous radio supernovae identified to date. Taken together, the multiwavelength properties of PS1-11aop are consistent with a CSM density profile with multiple zones. The early optical emission is consistent with the supernova blastwave interacting with a dense and confined CSM shell which contains multiple solar masses of material that was likely ejected in the final $&lt;$10-100 years prior to the explosion,($\sim$0.05$-$1.0 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at radii of $\lesssim$10$^{16}$\,cm). The radio observations, on the other hand, are consistent with a sparser environment ($\lesssim$2$\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at radii of $\sim$0.5-1$\times$10$^{17}$\,cm) -- thus probing the history of the progenitor star prior to its final mass loss episode.</description>

      <title>GRB 211024B: an ultra-long GRB powered by magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs) are characterized by exceptionally long-duration central engine activities, with characteristic timescales exceeding 1000 seconds. We present ground-based optical afterglow observations of the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB 211024B, detected by \textit{Swift}. Its X-ray light curve exhibits a characteristic ``internal plateau" with a shallow decay phase lasting approximately $\sim 15$ ks, followed by a steep decline ($\alpha_{\rm drop}\sim-7.5$). Moreover, the early optical emission predicted by the late r-band optical afterglow is significantly higher than the observed value, indicating an external shock with energy injection. To explain these observations, we propose a magnetar central engine model. The magnetar collapse into a black hole due to spin-down or hyperaccretion, leading to the observed steep break in the X-ray light curve. The afterglow model fitting reveals that the afterglow injection luminosity varies with different assumptions of the circumburst medium density, implying different potential energy sources. For the interstellar medium (ISM) case with a fixed injection end time, the energy may originate from the magnetar's dipole radiation. However, in other scenarios, relativistic jets produced by the magnetar/black hole system could be the primary energy source.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves Detected by a Burst Search in LIGO/Virgo's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burst searches identify gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the detector data without use of a specific signal model, unlike the matched-filter searches that correlate data with simulated signal waveforms (templates). While matched filters are optimal for detection of known signals in the Gaussian noise, the burst searches can be more efficient in finding unusual events not covered by templates or those affected by non-Gaussian noise artifacts. Here, we report the detection of 3 gravitational wave signals that are uncovered by a burst search Coherent WaveBurst (cWB) optimized for the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. They were found in the data from the LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3) with a combined significance of 3.6 $\sigma$. Each event appears to be a BBH merger not previously reported by the LIGO/Virgo's matched-filter searches. The most significant event has a reconstructed primary component in the upper mass gap ($m_1 = 70^{+36}_{-18}\,$M$_\odot$), and unusually low mass ratio ($m_2/m_1\sim0.3$), implying a dynamical or AGN origin. The 3 new events are consistent with the expected number of cWB-only detections in the O3 run ($4.8 \pm 2.1$), and belong to the stellar-mass binary population with the total masses in the $70-100$ M$_\odot$ range.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Cataclysmic Variables with Binary-Driven Mass-Loss during Nova Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions of cataclysmic variables (CVs) suggest that there exists unknown angular momentum loss mechanism(s) besides magnetic braking and gravitational radiation. Mass loss due to nova eruptions belongs to the most likely candidates. While standard theory assumes that mass is lost in the form of radiation driven, optically thick wind (fast wind; FW), recent numerical simulations indicate that most of the mass loss is initiated and shaped by binary interaction. We explore the effect of this binary-driven mass-loss (BDML) on the CV evolutions assuming a major fraction of the lost mass leaves the system from the outer Lagrangian point. Different from the traditional continuous wind picture, we consider the mass loss process to be instantaneous, because the duration of nova eruptions is much shorter than the binary evolutionary timescale. Our detailed binary evolution calculations reveal the following results. (1) BDML seems able to provide extra angular momentum loss below the period gap. The mass transfer rates at a given orbital period occupy a large range, in agreement with the observed secular mass transfer rate distribution in CVs. (2) The enhanced mass transfer rates do not lead to runaway mass transfer process, and allow the white dwarfs to grow mass $\lesssim 0.1\,M_{\odot}$. (3) BDML can cause both positive and negative variations of the orbital period induced by nova eruptions, in line with observations, and can potentially explain the properties of some peculiar supersoft X-ray sources likely CAL 87, 1E 0035.4$-$7230, and RX J0537.7$-$7034.</description>

      <title>Photon ring polarimetry with next-generation black hole imaging I. M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-horizon region of a black hole impacts linear (LP) and circular polarization (CP) through strong lensing of photons, adding large-scale symmetries and anti-symmetries to the polarized image. To probe the signature of lensing in polarimetry, we utilise a geometric model of concentric, Gaussian rings of equal radius to investigate the transition in the Fourier plane at which the photon ring signal begins to dominate over the direct image. We find analytic, closed-form expressions for the transition radii in total intensity, LP, and CP, wherein the resultant formulae are composed of ratios of tunable image parameters, with the overall "scale" set primarily by the thickness of the direct image. Using these formulae, we compute the transition radii for time-averaged images of M87* simulations at 230 GHz, studying both Magnetically Arrested Disc (MAD) and Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) configurations for various spin and electron heating models. We compare geometric values to radii obtained directly from the simulations through a coherent averaging scheme. We find that nearly all MAD models have a photon ring-dominated CP signal on long baselines shorter than the Earth diameter at 230 GHz. Across favored models for the M87* accretion flow identified by EHT polarimetric constraints, we quantify the sensitivity and antenna size requirements for the next-generation EHT and the Black Hole Explorer orbiter to detect these features. We find that the stringent requirements for CP favour explorations using long baselines on the ground, while LP remains promising on Earth-space baselines.</description>

      <title>Detection of very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the radio galaxy M87 with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby radio galaxy M87 is a very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitter established by observations with ground-based gamma-ray detectors. Here we report the long-term monitoring of M87 from 2021 to 2024 with Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). M87 has been detected by LHAASO with a statistical significance $\sim 9\sigma$. The observed energy spectrum extends to 20 TeV, with a possible hardening at $\sim 20$ TeV and then a clear softening at higher energies. Assuming that the intrinsic spectrum is described by a single power law up to 20 TeV, a tight upper bound on the extragalactic background light (EBL) intensity is obtained. A strong VHE flare lasting eight days, with the rise time of $\tau_{r}^{\rm rise} = 1.05\pm0.49$~days and decay time of $\tau_{d}^{\rm decay} = 2.17\pm0.58$~days, was found in early 2022. A possible GeV flare is seen also in the Fermi-LAT data during the VHE flare period. The variability time as short as one day seen in the LHAASO data suggests a compact emission region with a size of $\sim 3\times 10^{15}\delta\, {\rm cm}$ ($\delta$ being the Doppler factor of the emitting region), corresponding to a few Schwarzschild radii of the central supermassive black hole in M87. %The spectra of the VHE emission (in the energy range of 0.3--20 TeV) during the flare period and the low-state period are described by a power-law with a photon index of $2.57\pm0.23$ and $2.31\pm0.17$, respectively. The continuous monitoring of the source reveals a duty cycle of $\sim 1\%$ for VHE flares with a flux above $ 10^{-11}{\rm~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we point out that, unlike previously asserted in the literature, a transient gravitational wave signal from the inspiral phase of light black hole mergers is in principle detectable with current and future high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, including but not limited to ADMX. The largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to explain the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube assuming that their sources are active galactic nuclei (AGN). The results are obtained in the model where the accretion disc emits in the UV-optical range inside the electron plasma cloud. Using the Monte-Carlo approach to model photopion interactions in jets and then after taking into account the cosmological evolution it is shown that the resulting spectrum can explain the observed neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Field on the Formation of Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow around Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of magnetic field in the formation of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) in the presence of Bremsstrahlung cooling, which facilitates the formation of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk surrounded by a hot corona. We have performed axis-symmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of an initial accretion torus with a $1/r$ dependant local poloidal field in the presence of a pseudo-Newtonian potential, taking into account optically thin cooling, resistivity and viscosity. We observe the formation of persistent jets and magnetised outflows from the corona surrounding a thin disk with an increase in the magnetic diffusivity parameter. We have defined an equivalent time scale ($\tau_{eq}$) which takes into account the heating time scales due to viscosity, resistivity, magnetic reconnection and magneto-rotational instability turbulence such that the thin disk is formed if the cooling time scale ($\tau_{cool}$) is lower than this equivalent time scale ($\tau_{cool}/\tau_{eq}&lt;1$). Using this condition, for the first time, we found that the thin disk exists when the initial ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure (plasma beta) exceeds a range of $600-800$ for the gas obeying a polytropic equation of state accreting at $10^{-5}\ M_{\odot}/year$</description>

      <title>Modified Characteristics of Hadronic Interactions in Ultra-high-energy Cosmic-ray Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from multiple experiments suggest that the current interaction models used in Monte Carlo simulations do not correctly reproduce the hadronic interactions in air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR), in particular - but not limited to - the production of muons during the showers. We have created a large library of UHECR simulations where the interactions at the highest energies are slightly modified in various ways - but always within the constraints of the accelerator data, without any abrupt changes with energy and without assuming any specific mechanism or dramatically new physics at the ultra-high energies. We find that even when very different properties - cross-section, elasticity and multiplicity - of the interactions are modified, the resulting changes in some air-shower observables are still mutually correlated. Thus not all possible combinations of changes of observables are easily reproduced by some combination of the modifications. Most prominently, the recent results of the Pierre Auger Observatory, which call for a change in the prediction of both the muon content at ground and the depth of the maximum of longitudinal development of the showers, are rather difficult to reproduce with such modifications, in particular when taking into account other cosmic-ray data. While some of these results are related to the assumptions we place on the modifications, the overall lessons are general and provide valuable insight into how the UHECR data can be interpreted from the point of view of hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy hadronic physics at the Pierre Auger Observatory: muon measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR), offers a unique insight into the properties of hadronic interactions occurring in air showers at energies well above those reached at human-made accelerators. The key probe into the hadronic interactions has, for a long time, been the number of muons arriving at the ground, which can be directly measured at Auger for energies up to 10 EeV using dedicated underground muon detectors or estimated through the observation of highly inclined showers using the surface detector of the Observatory. Further information can be obtained using the hybrid character of the Observatory, which allows the simultaneous observation of the longitudinal development of the shower with the fluorescence (and lately also radio) detector and the ground signal with the surface detector. Several different analyses using hybrid data show a discrepancy between the predictions of simulations based on the latest hadronic interaction models and data. This discrepancy has been long interpreted as a deficit in the number of muons predicted by the simulations with respect to the data. A new analysis using a global fit of the data on selected hybrid showers has shown that the disagreement between models and data is more complex and also involves the predictions for the depths of the maxima of the longitudinal shower development. At the same time, measurements of shower-to-shower fluctuations using inclined hybrid events show good agreement with the predictions, suggesting that the observed muon discrepancy is rather the result of a gradual accumulation of small changes during the shower development than of a major change in the properties of the first interaction. Recently, the Observatory has undergone an upgrade, which includes several components aimed at a significant improvement ...</description>

      <title>Investigating Unusual H$\alpha$ Features towards the Scutum Supershell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the unusual H$\alpha$ features found towards the Scutum Supershell via recent arc-minute and arc-second resolution imaging. These multi-degree features resemble a long central spine ending in a bow-shock morphology. We performed a multi-wavelength study in [SII] optical, radio continuum, infrared continuum, HI, CO, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions. Interestingly, we found the Galactic worm GW16.9$-$3.8 HI feature appears within the Scutum Supershell, and likely influences the spine morphology. Furthermore, the rightmost edge of the bow-shock H$\alpha$ emission overlaps with [S II] line emission, 4.85 GHz radio, and both 60$\mu$m and 100$\mu$m infrared continuum emissions, suggesting some potential for excitation by shock heating. We estimated the photo-ionisation from O-type and B-type stars in the region (including those from the OB associations Ser OB1B, Ser OB2 and Sct OB3) and found that this mechanism could supply the excitation to account for the observed H$\alpha$ luminosity of the spine and bow-shock of $\sim$1e36 - 2e36 erg/s (d/2.5 kpc)$^2$. Recent MHD simulations by Drozdov et al. (2022) demonstrate the potential for supernova events to drive outflow and bow-shock types of features of the same energetic nature and physical scale as the H$\alpha$ emission we observe here. While this clearly requires many supernova events over time, we speculate that one contributing event could have come from the presumably energetic supernova (hypernova) birth of the magnetar tentatively identified in the X-ray binary LS 5039.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Supernova Remnants with the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) remain prime candidates for hadronic particle acceleration within our galaxy, accounting for much of the Cosmic Ray flux. Next-generation instruments such as the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) will be of crucial importance in identifying new candidate SNRs. SWGO will observe two-thirds of the gamma-ray sky, covering the energy range between a few hundreds GeV and a PeV. In this work, we apply a model of SNR evolution to predict their gamma-ray spectra. Furthermore, we use our model in combination with the target SWGO sensitivity range to explore the SNR emission phase space and quantify detection prospects for SWGO. Finally, we validate our model for sources observed with current-generation instruments, fitting it using a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain technique to the observed gamma-ray emission from four SNRs. We anticipate that at least 8 SNRs will be detected by SWGO within 1 year.</description>

      <title>Dispersion properties of pulsar magnetospheric plasmas with relativistic Kappa distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kappa distribution could encompass the diverse characteristics of the magnetospheric plasma of surrounding of neutron stars in both hot and cold environments; however, the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution is so far widely used to characterise these plasmas. We aim to analyse the linear dispersion properties and to compare the growth rates yielded from the relativistic kinetic dispersion relation for the pulsar magnetospheric plasmas. We developed a numerical dispersion solver to investigate the plasmas with arbitrary velocity distributions, mainly focusing on relativistic kappa and Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution functions.
  By considering different kappa distribution indices and using analytical and numerical approaches, the dispersion properties of the kappa and Maxwell-J\"uttner distributions converge at high wave numbers and low temperatures, indicating that the choice of distribution functions has little effect at higher wave numbers $c.k/\omega_p \gg 1$ and high inverse temperatures $\rho=100$. However, each distribution function exhibits unique and complimentary properties in semi-relativistic to relativistic inverse temperatures $\rho \leq 10-1$ and at lower wave numbers $c.k/\omega_p\leq 1$. This highlights the necessity of utilizing such dispersion solver for these parameters that allows to properly comprehend the dispersion properties of the neutron star magnetospheric plasmas.</description>

      <title>Estimating Gamma-Ray Flux from Millisecond Pulsars Originating in Globular Clusters Near the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the contribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) to the gamma-ray excess observed in the Galactic Center by analyzing data from high-resolution direct N-body simulations of six globular clusters (GCs) that experience close encounters with the nuclear star cluster. Using the {\phi}-GPU code, we tracked the orbits of individual neutron stars (NSs) formed during the simulations, assuming a fraction of these NSs evolve into MSPs. Our model includes state-of-the-art single stellar evolution code including prescription for neutron star formation. We estimated the gamma-ray flux from these MSPs, considering known values for their gamma-ray emission. Our results show that MSPs originating from the six modeled GCs contribute a small but non-negligible fraction of the observed gamma-ray flux. This finding suggests that the actual gamma-ray flux from MSPs could be much higher when considering the entire population of GCs, potentially significantly contributing to the gamma-ray excess. This study highlights the importance of considering MSPs in the Galactic Center, originating from nearby globular clusters, as a potential source of the observed gamma-ray excess. Future work will involve more sophisticated simulations incorporating binary stellar evolution and comparing the fraction of MSPs in observed GCs to refine our models and improve the accuracy of our estimates.</description>

      <title>A new method of reconstructing images of gamma-ray telescopes applied to the LST-1 of CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are used to observe very high-energy photons from the ground. Gamma rays are indirectly detected through the Cherenkov light emitted by the air showers they induce. The new generation of experiments, in particular the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), sets ambitious goals for discoveries of new gamma-ray sources and precise measurements of the already discovered ones. To achieve these goals, both hardware and data analysis must employ cutting-edge techniques. This also applies to the LST-1, the first IACT built for the CTAO, which is currently taking data on the Canary island of La Palma. This paper introduces a new event reconstruction technique for IACT data, aiming to improve the image reconstruction quality and the discrimination between the signal and the background from misidentified hadrons and electrons. The technique models the development of the extensive air shower signal, recorded as a waveform per pixel, seen by CTAO telescopes' cameras. Model parameters are subsequently passed to random forest regressors and classifiers to extract information on the primary particle. The new reconstruction was applied to simulated data and to data from observations of the Crab Nebula performed by the LST-1. The event reconstruction method presented here shows promising performance improvements. The angular and energy resolution, and the sensitivity, are improved by 10 to 20% over most of the energy range. At low energy, improvements reach up to 22%, 47%, and 50%, respectively. A future extension of the method to stereoscopic analysis for telescope arrays will be the next important step.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion-Like Particles with X-ray Observations of Alpha Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) in stellar cores, where they interact with electromagnetic fields and electrons, with typical masses between $\mathcal O(0.1)$ and $\mathcal O(10)$ keV. These low-energy ALPs are gravitationally trapped in the orbits of stars and subsequently decay into two photons that we detect as monochromatic X-ray lines. We propose to search for these gravitationally trapped ALPs in the Alpha Centauri binary system, our closest stellar neighbor, using sensitive X-ray detectors like Chandra and eROSITA. Our search for ALP decay signals in the energy range of 0.2 keV to 10 keV yielded null results, thus establishing the most stringent limits on ALP interactions to date. Specifically, if ALPs are mainly produced by Compton or bremsstrahlung processes (ALP-electron coupling $g_{aee}$ being significant), we have improved the limits on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ by two to three orders of magnitude, in ALP mass range between 0.2 keV to 5 keV, compared to previous measurements, including those from GW170817, SN 2023ixf, and other sources.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Bubble around Microquasar V4641 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars are laboratories for the study of jets of relativistic particles produced by accretion onto a spinning black hole. Microquasars are near enough to allow detailed imaging of spatial features across the multiwavelength spectrum. The recent extension of the spatial morphology of a microquasar, SS 433, to TeV gamma rays \cite{abeysekara2018very} localizes the acceleration of electrons at shocks in the jet far from the black hole \cite{hess2024ss433}. Here we report TeV gamma-ray emission from another microquasar, V4641~Sgr, which reveals particle acceleration at similar distances from the black hole as SS~433. Additionally, the gamma-ray spectrum of V4641 is among the hardest TeV spectra observed from any known gamma-ray source and is detected up to 200 TeV. Gamma rays are produced by particles, either electrons or hadrons, of higher energies. Because electrons lose energy more quickly the higher their energy, such a spectrum either very strongly constrains the electron production mechanism or points to the acceleration of high-energy hadrons. This observation suggests that large-scale jets from microquasars could be more common than previously expected and that microquasars could be a significant source of Galactic cosmic rays. high energy gamma-rays also provide unique constraints on the acceleration mechanisms of extra-Galactic cosmic rays postulated to be produced by the supermassive black holes and relativistic jets of quasars. The distance to quasars limits imaging studies due to insufficient angular resolution of gamma-rays and due to attenuation of the highest energy gamma-rays by the extragalactic background light.</description>

      <title>Collisionless tearing instability in relativistic non-thermal pair plasma and its application to MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless tearing instability with a power-law distribution function in a relativistic pair plasma with a guide field is studied. When the current sheet is supported by plasma pressure, the tearing mode is suppressed as the particle spectrum hardens. In the force-free limit, the instability growth rate becomes independent of the particle spectrum. We apply these results to relativistic MHD turbulence, where magnetic energy greatly exceeds plasma rest energy, and derive an expression for the transverse size of turbulent eddies unstable to tearing mode. We also establish the critical plasma magnetization parameter above which charge starvation prevents the tearing instability. These results might be useful for developing more accurate models of particle acceleration in relativistic astrophysical sources.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous detection of an intense X-ray flare in the weak-line T Tauri star KM Ori with SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS) exhibit X-ray flares, likely resulting from magnetic reconnection that heats the stellar plasma to very high temperatures. These flares are difficult to identify through targeted observations. Here, we report the serendipitous detection of the brightest X-ray flaring state of KM Ori in the eROSITA DR1 survey. Observations from SRG/eROSITA, Chandra X-ray Observatory, and XMM-Newton are analysed to assess the X-ray properties of KM Ori, thereby establishing its flaring state at the eROSITA epoch. The long-term (1999-2020) X-ray light curve generated for the Chandra observations confirmed that eROSITA captured the source at its highest X-ray flaring state recorded to date. Multi-instrument observations support the X-ray flaring state of the source, with time-averaged X-ray luminosity ($L_{0.2-5keV}$) reaching $\sim 1.9\times10^{32}{erg~s^{-1}}$ at the eROSITA epoch, marking it the brightest and possibly the longest flare observed to date. Such intense X-ray flares have been detected only in a few WTTS. The X-ray spectral analysis unveils the presence of multiple thermal plasma components at all epochs. The notably high luminosity ($L_{0.5-8~keV}\sim10^{32}{erg~s}^{-1}$), energy ($E_{0.5-8~keV}\sim10^{37}$erg), and the elevated emission measures of the thermal components in the eROSITA epoch indicate a superflare/megaflare state of KM Ori. Additionally, the H$\alpha$ line equivalent width of $\sim$-5\AA from our optical spectral analysis, combined with the lack of infrared excess in the spectral energy distribution, were used to re-confirm the WTTS (thin disk/disk-less) classification of the source. The long-duration flare of KM Ori observed by eROSITA indicates the possibility of a slow-rise top-flat flare. The detection demonstrates the potential of eROSITA to uncover such rare, transient events, thereby providing new insights into the X-ray activity of WTTS.</description>

      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time. Primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$, however, should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

      <title>Photon conversion to axions and dark photons in magnetized plasmas: a finite-temperature field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the most stringent constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) arise from considerations of particle emission from astrophysical plasmas. However, many studies assume that particle production occurs in an isotropic plasma environment. This condition is rarely (if ever) met in astrophysical settings, for instance due to the ubiquitous presence of magnetic fields. In anisotropic plasmas, the equations of motion are not diagonal in the usual polarization basis of transverse and longitudinal modes, causing a mixing of these modes and breaking the degeneracy in the dispersion relation of the two transverse modes. This behavior is captured by a $3\times3$ mixing matrix $\pi^{IJ}$, determined by projecting the response tensor of the plasma $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ into mode space, whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues are related to the normal modes and their dispersion relations. In this work, we provide a general formalism for determining the normal modes of propagation that are coupled to axions and dark photons in an anisotropic plasma. As a key part of this formalism, we present detailed derivations of $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ for magnetized plasmas in the long-wavelength limit using the real-time formalism of finite-temperature field theory. We provide analytic approximations for the normal modes and their dispersion relations assuming various plasma conditions that are relevant to astrophysical environments. These approximations will allow for a systematic exploration of the effects of plasma anisotropy on BSM particle production.</description>

      <title>Regulator-independent equations of state for neutron stars generated from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equation of state (EoS) of a neutron star (NS) accounting for new advances. In the low energy density, $n\leq 0.1 n_s$, with $n_s$ the saturation density, we use a new pure neutron matter EoS that is regulator independent and expressed directly in terms of experimental nucleon-nucleon scattering data. In the highest-density domain our EoS's are matched with pQCD to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. First principles of causality, thermodynamic consistency and stability are invoked to transit between these two extreme density regimes. The EoS's are further constrained by the new measurements from PREX-II and CREX on the symmetry energy ($S_0$) and its slope ($L$). In addition, we also take into consideration the recent experimental measurements of masses and radii of different NSs and tidal deformabilities. A band of allowed EoS's is then obtained. Interestingly, the resulting values within the band for $S_0$ and $L$ are restricted with remarkably narrower intervals than the input values, with $32.9\leq S_0 \leq 39.5~\text{MeV}$ and $ 37.3 \leq L\leq 69.0~\text{MeV}$ at the 68\% CL. The band of EoS's constructed also allows possible phase transitions (PTs) for NS masses above 2.1~$M_\odot$ at 68\% CL for $n&gt;2.5n_s$. We find both long and short coexistence regions during the PT, corresponding to first and second order PTs, respectively. We also generate the band of EoS's when excluding the astrophysical observables. This is of interest to test General Relativity and modified theories of gravity. Our band of EoS's for NSs can be also used to study other NS properties and dark matter capture in NS.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on gamma-ray spectral irregularities. II: EBL absorption models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how the extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption effect influences the photon to axionlike particle (ALP) conversions from the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral irregularities. For our analysis, we select two well-known BL Lac blazars: Markarian 421 and Markarian 501 with their low and well-defined redshifts $z_0=0.031$ and 0.034, respectively. Their gamma-ray data are recently measured by Fermi-LAT and HAWC with the 1038 days of exposure from 2015 June to 2018 July. We first discuss the EBL absorption effect on the gamma-ray spectral energy distributions by using three common EBL spectral models: Franceschini-08, Finke-10, and Gilmore-12. Then we consider the photon-ALP conversions in the astrophysical magnetic fields. Under the ALP assumption with the parameter space of $\{m_a, g_{a\gamma}\}$, we calculate the best-fit chi-square distribution of the EBL models and define a new delta chi-square $\chi_d^2$ to quantify the chi-square difference. Our results show that the impact from these different EBL spectral models are non-dominated at the low-redshift gamma-ray axionscope.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Detector Sensitivity to Eccentric Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers carries crucial information about the binary's formation and environment. There are emerging signs that some of the mergers detected by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors could indeed be eccentric. Nevertheless, the identification of eccentricity via gravitational waves remains challenging, to a large extent because of the limited availability of eccentric gravitational waveforms. While multiple suites of eccentric waveforms have recently been developed, they each cover only a part of the binary parameter space. Here we evaluate the sensitivity of LIGO to eccentric waveforms from the SXS and RIT numerical relativity catalogs and the TEOBResumS-Dali waveform model using data from LIGO-Virgo-Kagra's third observing run. The obtained sensitivities, as functions of eccentricity, mass and mass ratio, are important inputs to understanding detection prospects and observational population constrains. In addition, our results enable the comparison of the waveforms to establish their compatibility and applicability for searches and parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Adapting a novel framework for rapid inference of massive black hole binaries for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect a variety of gravitational-wave events, including mergers of massive black hole binaries, stellar-mass black hole inspirals, and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. LISA's capability to observe signals with high signal-to-noise ratios raises concerns about waveform accuracy. Additionally, its ability to observe long-duration signals will raise the computational cost of Bayesian inference, making it challenging to use costly and novel models with standard stochastic sampling methods without incorporating likelihood and waveform acceleration techniques. In this work, we present our attempt to tackle these issues. We adapt ${\tt RIFT}$ for LISA to take advantage of its embarrassingly parallel architecture, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets with costly gravitational wave models without relying on likelihood or waveform acceleration. We demonstrate that we can accurately infer parameters of massive black hole binary signals by carrying out a zero-noise injection recovery using the numerical relativity surrogate model ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$. By utilizing all available $m\neq0$ modes in the inference, we study the impact of higher modes on LISA data analysis. We study the impact of multiple massive black hole binary signals in a dataset on the inference of a single signal, showing that the selected source's inference remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, we analyze the LDC-1A and blind LDC-2A datasets from the Radler and Sangria challenge of the LISA data challenges. When eschewing specialized hardware, we find ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$ injection-recovery takes approximately $20$ hours to complete, while the analysis of Sangria and Radler datasets takes about $10$ hours to complete.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Scale-Dependent Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse in the general framework of scale-dependent gravity. We explore the collapse in spherically symmetric solutions suggested both by asymptotically safe gravity (positive $\om$-parameter) and by scale-dependent gravity (negative $\om$-parameter), when a singularity at a finite positive radial coordinate is developed. The inner geometry of the collapsing star is described, as usual, by the spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, and matter is uniformly distributed without any assumptions about its equation of state. The outer asymptotically-safe/scale-dependent black hole metric is smoothly matched to the inner geometry, and this yields the equation of motion of the star surface, the energy density, pressure, and equation of state of the collapsing matter. We study in detail the proper-time evolution of the event and apparent horizons. Finally, the constraints of the energy conditions on the equation of state, and its properties, are considered and discussed.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurements of Synchrotron-Emitting Electrons at Near-Sun Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present the first-ever direct measurements of synchrotron-emitting heliospheric traveling shocks, intercepted by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its close encounters. Given that much of our understanding of powerful astrophysical shocks is derived from synchrotron radiation, these observations by PSP provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore how shocks accelerate relativistic electrons and the conditions under which they emit radiation. The probe's unparalleled capabilities to measure both electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the near-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of relativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal that strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher intensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration of ultra-relativistic electrons. These experimental results are consistent with theory and recent observations of supernova remnant shocks and advance our understanding of shock physics across diverse space environments.</description>

Abstract: Binary interactions are commonplace among massive stars, giving rise observed phenomena such as X-ray binaries, stripped stars &amp; supernovae, and gravitational-wave sources. The multiplicity properties of massive stars thus represent a fundamental observable to calibrate, test, and benchmark models of single-star and binary evolution. In these proceedings, I provide a modern summary of the observed properties of massive binaries across various metallicities, and discuss open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Actinide-boosting r Process in Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger Ejecta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine nucleosynthesis in the ejecta of black hole-neutron star mergers based on the results of long-term neutrino-radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations for the first time. We find that the combination of dynamical and post-merger ejecta reproduces a solar-like r-process pattern. Moreover, the enhancement level of actinides is highly sensitive to the distribution of both electron fraction and the velocity of the dynamical ejecta. Our result implies that the mean electron fraction of dynamical ejecta should be &gt;~ 0.05 in order to reconcile the nucleosynthetic abundances with those in r-process-enhanced, actinide-boost stars. Since the tidal ejecta preserve the neutron-richness in the inner crust of pre-merging neutron stars, this result provides an important constraint for nuclear equations of state, if black hole-neutron star mergers are responsible for actinide-boost stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

      <title>On the properties of X-ray corona in Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>

Abstract: We carried out a uniform and systematic analysis of a sample of 112 nearby bright Seyfert 1 type AGN, the observations of which were carried out by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) between August 2013 and May 2022. The main goal of this analysis is to investigate the nature of the X-ray corona in Seyfert 1 galaxies. By fitting a physical model to the {\it NuSTAR} spectra, we were able to constrain the high-energy cut-off ($\rm{E_{cut}}$) for 73 sources in our sample. To estimate the temperature of the corona ($\rm{kT_{e}}$) in our sample of 112 sources, we used the Comptonization model to fit their spectra. We could constrain $\rm{kT_{e}}$ in 42 sources. We found a strong positive correlation between $\rm{E_{cut}}$ and $\rm{kT_{e}}$ with most of the sources lying above the empirical approximation of $\rm{E_{cut}}$ = 2$-$3 $\rm{kT_{e}}$. We investigated for possible correlations between various properties of the corona obtained from physical model fits to the observed spectra and between various coronal parameters and physical properties of the sources such as Eddington ratio and black hole mass. We found (a) a strong correlation between $\rm{E_{cut}}$ and the photon index and (b) a significant negative correlation between $\rm{kT_{e}}$ and the optical depth. From detailed statistical analysis of the correlation of coronal parameters with the Eddington ratio and black hole mass, we found no significant correlation. The correlations observed in this study indicate that an optically thin corona is needed to sustain a hotter corona with a steeper spectrum.</description>

      <title>Bridging Scales in Black Hole Accretion and Feedback: Magnetized Bondi Accretion in 3D GRMHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fueling and feedback couple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to their host galaxies across many orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal scales, making this problem notoriously challenging to simulate. We use a multi-zone computational method based on the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) code KHARMA that allows us to span $7$ orders of magnitude in spatial scale, to simulate accretion onto a non-spinning SMBH from an external medium with Bondi radius $R_B\approx 2\times 10^5 \,GM_\bullet/c^2$, where $M_\bullet$ is the SMBH mass. For the classic idealized Bondi problem, spherical gas accretion without magnetic fields, our simulation results agree very well with the general relativistic analytic solution. Meanwhile, when the accreting gas is magnetized, the SMBH magnetosphere becomes saturated with a strong magnetic field. The density profile varies as $\sim r^{-1}$ rather than $r^{-3/2}$ and the accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is consequently suppressed by over 2 orders of magnitude below the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$. We find continuous energy feedback from the accretion flow to the external medium at a level of $\sim10^{-2}\dot{M}c^2 \sim 5\times 10^{-5} \dot{M}_B c^2$. Energy transport across these widely disparate scales occurs via turbulent convection triggered by magnetic field reconnection near the SMBH. Thus, strong magnetic fields that accumulate on horizon scales transform the flow dynamics far from the SMBH and naturally explain observed extremely low accretion rates compared to the Bondi rate, as well as at least part of the energy feedback.</description>

Abstract: The study of the entire population of SNRs in a galaxy helps us to understand the underlying stellar populations, the environments, in which the SNRs are evolving, and the stellar feedback on the ISM. The all-sky survey carried out by the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) has provided us with spatially and spectrally resolved X-ray data of the entire Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its immediate surroundings in the soft X-ray band down to 0.2 keV. We performed a multiwavelength analysis of previously known SNR candidates and newly detected SNRs and SNR candidates. We applied the Gaussian gradient magnitude (GGM) filter to the eROSITA images of the LMC to highlight the edges of the shocked gas in order to find new SNRs. We compared the X-ray images with those of their optical and radio counterparts to investigate the true nature of the extended emission. We used the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) for the optical data. For the radio comparison, we used data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) survey of the LMC. Using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) we have investigated the possible progenitors of the new SNRs and SNR candidates in our sample. We present the most updated catalogue of SNRs in the LMC. The eROSITA data have allowed us to confirm 1 of the previous SNR candidates and discover 16 new extended sources. We confirm 3 of them as new SNRs, while we propose the remaining 13 as new X-ray SNR candidates. We also present the first analysis of the follow-up XMM-Newton observation of MCSNR J0456-6533 discovered with eROSITA. Among the new candidates, we propose J0614-7251 (4eRASSU J061438.1-725112) as the first X-ray SNR candidate in the outskirts of the LMC.</description>

      <title>The rate of extreme coronal line emitting galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and their relation to tidal disruption events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-ionization iron coronal lines (CLs) are a rare phenomenon observed in galaxy and quasi-stellar object spectra that are thought to be created by high-energy emission from active galactic nuclei and certain types of transients. In cases known as extreme coronal line emitting galaxies (ECLEs), these CLs are strong and fade away on a timescale of years. The most likely progenitors of these variable CLs are tidal disruption events (TDEs), which produce sufficient high-energy emission to create and sustain the CLs over these timescales. To test the possible connection between ECLEs and TDEs, we present the most complete variable ECLE rate calculation to date and compare the results to TDE rates from the literature. To achieve this, we search for ECLEs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We detect sufficiently strong CLs in 16 galaxies, more than doubling the number previously found in SDSS. We find that none of the nine new ECLEs evolve in a manner consistent with that of the five previously discovered variable ECLEs. Using this sample of five variable ECLEs, we calculate the galaxy-normalized rate of variable ECLEs in SDSS to be $R_\mathrm{G}=3.6~^{+2.6}_{-1.8}~(\mathrm{statistical})~^{+5.1}_{-0.0} (\mathrm{systematic})\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. The mass-normalised rate is $R_\mathrm{M}=3.1~^{+2.3}_{-1.5}~(\mathrm{statistical})~^{+4.4}_{-0.0}~(\mathrm{systematic})\times10^{-17}~\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the volumetric rate is $R_\mathrm{V}=7~^{+20}_{-5}~(\mathrm{statistical})~^{+10}_{-0.0}~(\mathrm{systematic})\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Our rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, which suggests that only 10 to 40 per cent of all TDEs produce variable ECLEs. Additional uncertainties in the rates arising from the structure of the interstellar medium have yet to be included.</description>

Abstract: In order to test the efficacy of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRB) as cosmological probes, we characterize the scatter in the correlations between six pairs of GRB observables, which have previously also been studied in arXiv:2011.14040. However, some of these observables depend on the luminosity distance, for which one needs to assume an underlying cosmological model. In order to circumvent this circularity problem, we use X-ray and UV fluxes of quasars as distance anchors to calculate the luminosity distance in a model-independent manner, which in turn is used to calculate the GRB-related quantities. We find that all six pairs of regression relations show high intrinsic scatter for both the low and high redshift sample. This implies that these GRB observables cannot be used as model-independent high precision cosmological probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radioactive power generated by materials within the ejecta of a binary-neutron-star (BNS) merger powers an optical transient known as a kilonova. When the central remnant of a BNS merger is a long-lived magnetar, it continuously produces a highly magnetized wind, altering both the dynamics and temperature of the ejecta, leading to the expected emergence of an engine-fed kilonova. In the first paper of this series, we conducted a detailed study of the dynamics of wind-ejecta interaction and the efficiency of energy injection through shocks. In this work, we combine this dynamical evolution with both shock-heating and additional X-ray irradiation to model photon diffusion within a constant-opacity ejecta. By calculating the radiation, we obtain the light curve and spectral energy distribution (SED). Our findings reveal that, with energy injection, a blue bump typically appears in the early stages ($\lesssim 1$ day). Furthermore, if the magnetar has not spun down by that time, a brightening in the later stages occurs. Despite this, in a large parameter space, the expected luminosity of the engine-fed kilonova is not significantly higher than the typical r-process kilonova due to limited heating efficiency. The SED of engine-fed kilonovae peaks in the relatively blue band in the early stages and evolves towards the red, but at a slower rate compared to the typical r-process kilonova.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) accelerated in astrophysical environments have been shown to shape the energy production rate of nuclei escaping from the confinement zone. To address the influence of hadronic interactions, Hadronic Interaction Models (HIM) come into play. In this context, we present a parameterization capable of capturing the outcomes of two distinct HIMs, namely EPOS-LHC and Sibyll2.3d, in terms of secondary fluxes, including escaping nuclei, neutrinos, photons, and electrons. Our parametrization is systematically evaluated against the source codes, both at fixed energy and mass, as well as in a physical case scenario. The comparison demonstrates that our parameterization aligns well with the source codes, establishing its reliability as a viable alternative for analytical or fast Monte Carlo approaches dedicated to the study of UHECR propagation within source environments. This suggests the potential for utilizing our parameterization as a practical substitute in studies focused on the intricate dynamics of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</description>

Abstract: The spin-down law of pulsars is generally perturbed by two types of timing irregularities: glitches and timing noise. Glitches are sudden changes in the rotational frequency of pulsars, while timing noise is a discernible stochastic wandering in the phase, period, or spin-down rate of a pulsar. We present the timing results of a sample of glitching pulsars observed using the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Our findings include timing noise analysis for 17 pulsars, with seven being reported for the first time. We detected five glitches in four pulsars and a glitch-like event in PSR J1825-0935. The frequency evolution of glitch in pulsars, J0742-2822 and J1740-3015, is presented for the first time. Additionally, we report timing noise results for three glitching pulsars. The timing noise was analyzed separately in the pre-glitch region and post-glitch regions. We observed an increase in the red noise parameters in the post-glitch regions, where exponential recovery was considered in the noise analysis. Timing noise can introduce ambiguities in the correct evaluation of glitch observations. Hence, it is important to consider timing noise in glitch analysis. We propose an innovative glitch verification approach designed to discern between a glitch and strong timing noise. The novel glitch analysis technique is also demonstrated using the observed data.</description>

      <title>Afterglow Linear Polarization Signatures from Shallow GRB Jets: Implications for Energetic GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powered by ultra-relativistic jets. The launching sites of these jets are surrounded by dense media, which the jets must cross before they can accelerate and release the high energy emission. Interaction with the medium leads to the formation of a mildly relativistic sheath around the jet resulting in an angular structures in the jet's asymptotic Lorentz factor and energy per solid angle, which modifies the afterglow emission. We build a semi-analytical tool to analyze the afterglow light curve and polarization signatures of jets observed from a wide range of viewing angles, and focus on ones with slowly declining energy profiles known as shallow jets. We find overall lower polarization compared to the classical top-hat jet model. We provide an analytical expression for the peak polarization degree as a function of the energy profile power-law index, magnetic field configuration and viewing angle, and show that it occurs near the light curve break time for all viewers. When applying our tool to GRB 221009A, suspected to originate from a shallow jet, we find that the suggested jet structures for this event agree with the upper limits placed on the afterglow polarization in the optical and X-ray bands. We also find that at early times the polarization levels may be significantly higher, allowing for a potential distinction between different jet structure models and possibly constraining the magnetization in both forward and reverse shocks at that stage.</description>

      <title>Broad band spectral modeling of M87 nucleus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spectra produced by weakly accreting black hole (BH) systems using the semi-analytic advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and the general-relativistic magentohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation. We find significant differences between these two approaches related to a wider spread of the flow parameters as well as a much steeper radial distribution of the magnetic field in the latter. We apply these spectral models to the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of M87 galaxy. The standard (in particular, one-dimensional) formulation of the ADAF model does not allow to explain it; previous claims that this model reproduces the observed SED suffer from an inaccurate treatment of the Compton process. The spectra based on GRMHD simulation are in a much better agreement with the observed data. In our GRMHD model, in which we assumed the BH spin $a=0.9$, bulk of radiation observed between the millimeter and the X-ray range is produced in the disk area within 4 gravitational radii from the BH. In this solution, the synchrotron component easily reproduces the spectral data between the millimeter and the UV range, and the Compton component does not violate the X-rays constraints, for accretion rates not exceeding 0.01 Msun/year and a relatively strong magnetic field, with the plasma $\beta \sim 1$ in the region where radiation is produced. However, the Compton component cannot explain the observed X-ray spectrum. Instead, the X-ray spectrum can be reproduced by a high energy tail of the synchrotron spectrum if electrons have a hybrid energy distribution with a $\sim 5$ per cent nonthermal component.</description>

      <title>She's Got Her Mother's Hair: Unveiling the Origin of Black Hole Magnetic Fields through Stellar to Collapsar Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from a Kerr black hole (BH) following the core collapse of a massive star ("collapsar") is a leading model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the two key ingredients for a Blandford-Znajek powered jet $-$ rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field $-$ seem mutually exclusive. Strong fields in the progenitor star's core transport angular momentum outwards more quickly, slowing down the core before collapse. Through innovative multidisciplinary modeling, we first use MESA stellar evolution models followed to core collapse, to explicitly show that the small length-scale of the instabilities $-$ likely responsible for angular momentum transport in the core (e.g., Tayler-Spruit) $ - $ results in a low net magnetic flux fed to the BH horizon, far too small to power GRB jets. Instead, we propose a novel scenario in which collapsar BHs acquire their magnetic "hair" from their progenitor proto-neutron star (PNS), which is likely highly magnetized from an internal dynamo. We evaluate the conditions for the BH accretion disk to pin the PNS magnetosphere to its horizon immediately after the collapse. Our results show that the PNS spin-down energy released before collapse matches the kinetic energy of Type Ic-BL supernovae, while the nascent BH's spin and magnetic flux produce jets consistent with observed GRB characteristics. We map our MESA models to 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and confirm that accretion disks confine the strong magnetic flux initiated near a rotating BH, enabling the launch of successful GRB jets, whereas a slower-spinning BH or one without a disk fails to do so.</description>

      <title>Swiftly chasing gravitational waves across the sky in real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, dubbed `continuous commanding,' achieving 10 seconds latency response time on-orbit to unscheduled Target of Opportunity requests. This allows Swift to respond to early warning gravitational-wave detections, rapidly slewing the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) across the sky to place the GW origin in the BAT field of view at merger time. This will dramatically increase the GW/GRB co-detection rate, and enable prompt arcminute localization of a neutron star merger. We simulate the full Swift response to a GW early warning alert, including input sky maps produced at different warning times, a complete model of Swift's attitude control system, and a full accounting of the latency between the GW detectors and the spacecraft. 60 s of early warning doubles the rate of prompt GRB detections with arcminute position, and 140 s guarantees observation anywhere on the unocculted sky, even with localization areas &gt;&gt; 1000 deg$^2$. While 140 s is beyond current gravitational wave detector sensitivities, 30-70 s is achievable today. We show that the detection yield is now limited by the latency of LIGO/Virgo cyber-infrastructure, and motivate focus on its reduction. Continuous commanding is now a general capability of Swift, significantly increasing its versatility in response to the growing demands of time-domain astrophysics. We demonstrate this potential on an externally triggered Fast Radio Burst, slewing 81 degrees across the sky, and collecting X-ray and UV photons from the source position &lt; 150 s after the trigger was received from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), thereby setting the earliest and deepest such constraints on high energy activity from non-repeating FRBs. The Swift Team invites proposals for novel scientific applications of ultra-low latency UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first seconds-long multidimensional general relativistic neutrino magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) in rapidly rotating, magnetized white dwarfs (WDs). Our findings show that, with sufficiently strong initial magnetic fields and rotation, these systems can generate relativistic jets and neutron-rich outflows with properties consistent with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) accompanied by kilonovae, such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230703A. Notably, our models reproduce the power and duration of these LGRBs and the associated kilonovae without the need for tuning parameters. Additionally, our results suggest that the AIC of WDs could be an important site of the production for heavy $r$-process elements.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field decreases the mass of NS. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field increases the deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>Reversals of toroidal magnetic field in local shearing box simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presence of a hot corona above the accretion disc can have important consequences for the evolution of magnetic fields and the Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in such a strongly coupled system. In this work, we have performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical shearing-box numerical simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona above the cool disc. Such a two-layer, piece-wise isothermal system is vertically stratified under linear gravity and initial conditions here include a strong azimuthal magnetic field with a ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressures being of order unity in the disc region. Instabilities in this magnetized system lead to the generation of turbulence, which, in turn, governs the further evolution of magnetic fields in a self-sustaining manner. Remarkably, the mean toroidal magnetic field undergoes a complete reversal in time by changing its sign, and it is predominantly confined within the disc. This is a rather unique class of evolution of the magnetic field which has not been reported earlier. Solutions of mean magnetic fields here are thus qualitatively different from the vertically migrating dynamo waves that are commonly seen in previous works which model a single layer of an isothermal gas. Effective $\alpha$ is found to have values between 0.01 and 0.03. We have also made a comparison between models with Smagorinsky and explicit schemes for the kinematic viscosity ($\nu$). In some cases with an explicit $\nu$ we find a burst-like temporal behavior in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Energy Extraction in Kerr Black Holes through Frame-Dragging Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is argued that the zero-angular-momentum-observers (ZAMOs) circulating with the frame-dragging-angular-velocity $\omega$ plays a leading part in energy extraction. When the condition $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is satisfied, where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ and $\Omega_{\rm F}$ are the horizon and field-line (FL) angular-velocities (AVs), they will see that the null surface S$_{\rm N}$ with $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$ always exists in the force-free magnetosphere. The pivotal ZAMO-measured FLAV $\Omega_{\rm ZF} \equiv \Omega_{\rm F} - \omega$ changes sign on this surface S$_{\rm N}$ where the force-free and freezing-in conditions break down. The force-free magnetosphere is divided on this surface, with particle-current sources on it. The outer domain ${D}_{\rm (out)}$ outside S$_{\rm N}$ spins forward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&gt;0$), whereas the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ inside spins backward ($\Omega_{\rm ZF}&lt;0$).
  Because the electric field ${\bf E}_{\rm p}$ reverses direction there, the Poynting flux reverses direction as well from outward to inward, though the positive angular momentum always flows outwardly.
  Electromagnetic self-extraction of energy will be possible only through the frame-dragged magnetosphere, with the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ nested between the horizon and the surface S$_{\rm N}$, when $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is ensured by the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac field uniformly rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ and also subject to the constant magnetic field $B$ directed along the rotation axis. The causal states are constrained to the interior of the light cylinder of radius $c/\Omega$. When this radius is smaller than the system size, as in the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of the boundary on the fermion spectrum is critical. We derive the fermion spectrum and study its properties. We compute the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted due to transitions between the fermion states. We study its dependence on energy and angular momentum for different values of the angular velocity and the magnetic field. Rotation has enormous impact on the electromagnetic radiation by the quark-gluon plasma with or without the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Ringdown amplitudes of nonspinning eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the ringdown complex amplitudes of nonspinning unequal-mass binaries in arbitrarily eccentric orbits are presented. They are built upon 237 numerical simulations contained within the RIT catalog, through the parameterisation introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 101401]. Global fits for the complex amplitudes, associated to linear quasinormal mode frequencies of the dominant ringdown modes, are obtained in a factorised form immediately applicable to any existing quasi-circular model. Similarly to merger amplitudes, ringdown ones increase by more than 50% compared to the circular case for high impact parameters (medium eccentricities), while strongly suppressed in the low impact parameter (highly eccentric) limit. Such reduction can be explained by a transition between an "orbital-type" and an "infall-type" dynamics. The amplitudes (phases) fits accuracy lies around a few percent (deciradians) for the majority of the dataset, comparable to the accuracy of current state-of-the-art quasi-circular ringdown models, and well within current statistical errors of current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra ringdown observations. These expressions constitute another building block towards the construction of complete general-relativistic inspiral-merger-ringdown semi-analytical templates, and allow to extend numerically-informed spectroscopic analyses beyond the circular limit. Such generalisations are key to achieve accurate inference of compact binaries astrophysical properties, and tame astrophysical systematics within observational investigations of strong-field general relativistic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cross-Observatory Coordination with tilepy: A Novel Tool for Observations of Multi-Messenger Transient Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics has leaped forward with the direct discovery of gravitational waves and the emergence of new generation instruments for multi-messenger studies. The capacity of the multi-messenger multi-wavelength community to effectively pursue follow-up observations is hindered by the suboptimal localization of numerous transient events and the escalating volume of alerts. Thus, we have developed an effective tool to overcome the observational and technical hurdles inherent in the emerging field of multi-messenger astrophysics. We present tilepy, a Python package for the automatic scheduling of follow-up observations of poorly localized transient events. It is ideally suited to tackle the challenge of complex follow-up in mid and small-FoV telescope campaigns, with or without human intervention. We demonstrate the capabilities of tilepy in the realm of multi-observatory, multi-wavelength campaigns, to cover the localization uncertainty region of various events ultimately aiming at pinpointing the source of the multi-messenger emission. The tilepy code is publicly available on GitHub and is sufficiently flexible to be employed either automatically or in a customized manner, tailored to collaboration and individual requirements. tilepy is also accessible via a public API and through the Astro-COLIBRI platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has made breakthrough discoveries in gravitational-wave astronomy, a new field that provides a different means of observing our Universe. Gravitational-wave discoveries are possible thanks to the work of thousands of people from across the globe working together. In this article, we discuss the range of engagement activities used to communicate LVK gravitational-wave discoveries and the stories of the people behind the science, using the activities surrounding the release of the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog as a case study.</description>

      <title>A Buddy for Betelgeuse: Binarity as the Origin of the Long Secondary Period in $\alpha$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of $\alpha$ Ori B, a low-mass companion orbiting Betelgeuse. This is motivated by the presence of a 2170-day Long Secondary Period (LSP) in Betelgeuse's lightcurve, a periodicity $\approx5$ times longer than the star's 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is currently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial velocity variation observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a revision of the prevailing physical picture. The lightcurve-RV phase difference requires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, 180 degrees out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation. We demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational constraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within this framework, we calculate a mass for $\alpha$ Ori B of $M\sin i =1.17\pm0.7\,M_\odot$ and an orbital separation of $1850\pm70\,R_\odot$, or $2.43^{+0.21}_{-0.32}$ times the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion as constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital system, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion's existence observationally.</description>

      <title>Probing the high frequency variability of NGC 5044: the key to AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC 5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray bright intragroup medium (IGrM), as well as parsec scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA), Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high frequency observations of NGC 5044 to assess the time variability of the mmwaveband emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from the radio to sub-millimeter band. The SED is well described by advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with tau = 1kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1pc, and the magnetic field to 4.7mG in the jets and and 870G in the accretion disk. A longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Adapts to Changing PSD in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities for observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole inspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of physics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in gravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo poses major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression methods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the data, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over short time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI approach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own challenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient problem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture. To compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have developed a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect gravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our model achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows remarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the principles of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles with just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in dynamically changing noise environments.</description>
