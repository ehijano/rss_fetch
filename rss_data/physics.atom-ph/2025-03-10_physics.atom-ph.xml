      <title>Ionization phase-shifts between two laser-dressed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) in potassium atom is investigated within the strong coupling regime using photoelectron momentum imaging techniques. The kinetic energy distribution of the ionized electrons reveals the eigenenergies of the dressed states, which exhibit Autler-Townes (AT) splitting. This splitting is proportional to the laser field strength. Partial wave analysis of the photoelectrons angular distributions (PAD) uncovers relative phase shifts between the dressed states, shedding light on attosecond ionization time delays. The observed phase shift between the two electron wave packets generated by the AT splitting arises from the combined effects of the Coulomb phase and the quantum defect phase.</description>

      <title>Electric-field sensing with driven-dissipative time crystals in room-temperature Rydberg vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode competition in nonequilibrium Rydberg gases enables the exploration of emergent many-body phases. This work leverages this emergent phase for electric field detection at room temperature. Sensitive frequency-resolved electric field measurements at very low-frequencies (VLF) are of central importance in a wide range of applications where deep-penetration is required in communications, navigation and imaging or surveying. The long wavelengths on order of 10-100 km (3-30 kHz) limit the efficiency, sensitivity, and bandwidth of compact classical detectors that are constrained by the Chu limit. Rydberg-atom electrometers are an attractive approach for microwave electric-field sensors but have reduced sensitivity at lower-frequencies. Very recent efforts to advance the standard Rydberg-atoms approach is based on DC electric-field (E-field) Stark shifting and have resulted in sensitivities between 67.9-2.2 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 (0.1-10 kHz) by fine optimization of the DC E-field. A major challenge in these approaches is the need for embedded electrodes or plates due to DC E-field Stark screening effect, which can perturb coupling of VLF signals when injected from external sources. In this article, it is demonstrated that state-of-art sensitivity (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) can instead be achieved using limit-cycle oscillations in driven-dissipative Rydberg atoms by using a magnetic field (B-field) to develop mode-competition between nearby Rydberg states. The mode-competition between nearby Rydberg-states develop an effective transition centered at the oscillation frequency capable of supporting external VLF E-field coupling in the ~10-15kHz regime without the requirement for fine optimization of the B-field magnitude.</description>

      <title>MV-CLAM: Multi-View Molecular Interpretation with Cross-Modal Projection via Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human expertise in chemistry and biomedicine relies on contextual molecular understanding, a capability that large language models (LLMs) can extend through fine-grained alignment between molecular structures and text. Recent multimodal learning advances focus on cross-modal alignment, but existing molecule-text models ignore complementary information in different molecular views and rely on single-view representations, limiting molecular understanding. Moreover, na\"ive multi-view alignment strategies face two challenges: (1) separate aligned spaces with inconsistent mappings between molecule and text embeddings, and that (2) existing loss objectives fail to preserve complementary information for fine-grained alignment. This can limit the LLM's ability to fully understand the molecular properties. To address these issues, we propose MV-CLAM, a novel framework that aligns multi-view molecular representations into a unified textual space using a multi-query transformer (MQ-Former). Our approach ensures cross-view consistency while a token-level contrastive loss preserves diverse molecular features across textual queries. MV-CLAM enhances molecular reasoning, improving retrieval and captioning accuracy. The source code of MV-CLAM is available in https://github.com/sumin124/mv-clam.git.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of birefringence in cavity-based quantum networks using frequency-encoded photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom-cavity systems offer unique advantages for building large-scale distributed quantum computers by providing strong atom-photon coupling while allowing for high-fidelity local operations of atomic qubits. However, in prevalent schemes where the photonic state is encoded in polarization, cavity birefringence introduces an energy splitting of the cavity eigenmodes and alters the polarization states, thus limiting the fidelity of remote entanglement generation. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that encodes the photonic qubit in the frequency degree-of-freedom. The scheme relies on resonant coupling of multiple transverse cavity modes to different atomic transitions that are well-separated in frequency. We numerically investigate the temporal properties of the photonic wavepacket, two-photon interference visibility, and atom-atom entanglement fidelity under various cavity polarization-mode splittings and find that our scheme is less affected by cavity birefringence. Finally, we propose practical implementations in two trapped ion systems, using the fine structure splitting in the metastable D state of $\mathrm{^{40}Ca^{+}}$, and the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of $\mathrm{^{225}Ra^{+}}$. Our study presents an alternative approach for cavity-based quantum networks that is less sensitive to birefringent effects, and is applicable to a variety of atomic and solid-state emitter-cavity interfaces.</description>

      <title>Understanding the core limitations of second-order correlation-based functionals through: functional, orbital, and eigenvalue-driven analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory has long struggled to obtain the exact exchange-correlational (XC) functional. Numerous approximations have been designed with the hope of achieving chemical accuracy. However, designing a functional involves numerous methodologies, which has a greater possibility for error accumulation if the functionals are poorly formulated. This study aims to investigate the performance and limitations of second-order correlation functionals within the framework of density functional theory. Specifically, we focus on three major classes of density functional approximations that incorporate second-order energy expressions: \textit{ab initio} (primarily G\"{o}rling-Levy) functionals, adiabatic connection models, and double-hybrid functionals. The principal objectives of this research are to evaluate the accuracy of second-order correlation functionals, to understand how the choice of reference orbitals and eigenvalues affects the performance of these functionals, to identify the intrinsic limitations of second-order energy expressions, especially when using arbitrary orbitals or non-canonical configurations, and propose strategies for improving their accuracy. By addressing these questions, we aim to provide deeper insights into the factors governing the accuracy of second-order correlation functionals, thereby guiding future functional development.</description>

      <title>Cavity-mediated charge and pair-density waves in a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent light-matter interactions between a quantum gas and light in a high-finesse cavity can drive self-ordering phase transitions. To date, such phenomena have involved exclusively single-atom coupling to light, resulting in coupled charge-density or spin-density wave and superradiant order. In this work, we engineer simultaneous coupling of cavity photons to both single atoms and fermionic pairs, which are also mutually coupled due to strong correlations in the unitary Fermi gas. This interplay gives rise to an interference between the charge-density wave and a pair-density wave, where the short-range pair correlation function is spontaneously modulated in space. We observe this effect by tracking the onset of superradiance as the photon-pair coupling is varied in strength and sign, revealing constructive or destructive interference of the three orders with a coupling mediated by strong light-matter and atom-atom interactions. Our observations are compared with mean-field theory where the coupling strength between atomic- and pair-density waves is controlled by higher-order correlations in the Fermi gas. These results demonstrate the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics to produce and observe exotic orders in strongly correlated matter, paving the way for the quantum simulation of complex quantum matter using ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineering of Feshbach Resonances in Ultracold Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering resonances are fundamental in science, spanning energy scales from stellar nuclear fusion to ultracold collisions. In ultracold quantum gases, magnetic Feshbach resonances have transformed quantum many-body research by enabling precise interaction control between atoms. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer new Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a $^{6}$Li atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at MHz frequencies. This periodic modulation creates new resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>On the use of the Axelrod formula for thermal electron collisions in Astrophysical Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.</description>

      <title>Selective collective emission from a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a nanophotonic resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically study collective emission of a dense atomic ensemble coupled to a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) in a nanophotonic microring resonator. Due to many cold atoms localized in a small volume, these trapped atoms collectively couple not only to the WGM and but also to the non-guided modes in free space. Through tuning the atom-WGM coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the WGM. For photon emission via the non-guided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady-state states and the timed-Dicke states, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment, respectively. Our observation and methodology could shed light on future explorations of collective emission with densely packed quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>
