      <title>Graphene-Gold THz Metasurfaces with Tailored Resonant Structure for Enhanced Nonlinear Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene's exceptional nonlinear optical properties combined with resonant photonic structures offer a promising pathway for efficient nonlinear applications at terahertz (THz) frequencies. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fabrication-friendly hybrid nonlinear metasurface composed of gold patches integrated with uniform graphene, circumventing the need for complex graphene patterning. The structure supports strong localized resonances that enhance nonlinear interactions. By exploiting resonant enhancement at both the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies, we predict via simulations third-harmonic generation efficiencies as high as -15 dB (3.2%) under continuous-wave excitation at modest intensities (0.1 MW/cm$^2$). The metasurface is fabricated via electron-beam lithography and experimentally characterized using THz time-domain spectroscopy. Under pulsed excitation, we experimentally observe pronounced nonlinear frequency shifts up to 0.5~THz (12.5% fractional change), driven by self-phase modulation, consistent with simulation results. These findings highlight the potential of tailored graphene-based metasurfaces for efficient nonlinear THz photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Supersolid light in a semiconductor microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolidity - simultaneous superfluid flow and crystalline order - has been realized in quantum atomic systems but remains unexplored in purely photonic platforms operating at weak light-matter coupling. We predict a supersolid phase of light in a plasma-filled optical microcavity, where photons acquire effective mass and interact via nonlocal, plasma-mediated nonlinearities. By deriving a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a tunable photon-photon interaction kernel, we show that under coherent driving the cavity light field can spontaneously crystallize into a supersolid lattice via modulational instability. Crucially, this supersolid arises from a weak photon-electron coupling enabled by virtual electronic transitions, and it does not require hybrid polariton formation. Using doped semiconductor microcavities, we identify feasible conditions (electron densities $\sim 10^{10}- 10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and optical intensities $\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}~\mathrm{W/cm}^{2}$) for experimental realization. This work establishes plasmonic cavities as a platform for correlated photonic matter with emergent quantum order.</description>

      <title>Shape-to-Music: A Musical Representation for Structural Topologies of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials are increasingly attracting interest in engineering applications due to their unique mechanical properties and lightweight nature. This study develops a novel sound-based representation to characterize the topologies of mechanical metamaterials, including spinodal designs and porous cellular structures. Two distinct frameworks are introduced: an image-based approach, where material topologies are divided into grids and their relative densities are mapped to evolving melodies, and a numerical simulation approach, where finite element analysis (FEA) visualizes mechanical responses as color-coded images, translated into unique musical compositions. By applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the generated melodies are analyzed as frequency plots, revealing distinct acoustic signatures for each material topology. This innovative approach not only distinguishes between different metamaterial designs but also provides an intuitive, auditory tool for material characterization. The results demonstrate the potential of sound-based representations to complement traditional methods in materials modeling, offering new avenues for design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid integration of two-dimensional dichalcogenides for low power saturable absorption in photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonics provides a versatile platform for large-scale integration of optical functions, but its weak intrinsic nonlinear response limits the realization of active, intensity-dependent functionalities. Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome these limitations by enabling strong light--matter interaction and broadband absorption. Here, we demonstrate saturable absorption in a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microring resonator integrated with an exfoliated monolayer of 1T'-MoTe2. Transmission measurements under varying input powers reveal a clear nonlinear absorption response, with a saturation power as low as 2(1)uW. A phenomenological model accurately reproduces the experimental results, confirming the nonlinear behavior induced by the hybrid MoTe2 integration. These findings establish a proof-of-concept for ultracompact, low-power saturable absorbers in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), paving the way for applications in integrated lasers, ultrafast optical signal processing, and neuromorphic photonics.</description>

      <title>Toward Chaotic Group Velocity Hopping of an On-Chip Dissipative Kerr Soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos enables randomness-based applications, particularly in photonic systems. Integrated optical frequency combs (microcombs) have previously been observed in either chaotic modulation instability or stable, low-noise dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regimes. In this work, we demonstrate a new microcomb state where a single DKS exhibits chaotic behavior. By phase modulating the Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) between a DKS and an externally injected reference laser, we observe chaotic group velocity hopping of the soliton, causing random transitions of the repetition rate. Using a chip-integrated octave-spanning microcomb, we experimentally validate the second-order Adler equation describing KIS, allowing us to predict and demonstrate this chaotic DKS hopping. This work connects nonlinear dynamics with optical soliton physics, providing a deterministic framework for triggering microcomb chaos in the solitonic state.</description>

      <title>Multi-laser stabilization with an atomic-disciplined photonic integrated resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250 MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5 \times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated, compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic and trapped ion applications.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for exceptional point pairs in non-Hermitian two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems are branch singularities where eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce, leading to rich topological phenomena beyond those in Hermitian systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the interplay between eigenenergy braiding and Berry phase accumulation in two-level non-Hermitian systems hosting pairs of EPs. EP pairs are classified into four distinct classes according to the vorticity of eigenenergies, the Berry phase accumulated during encircling, and the eigenstate projection onto a basis state. Their associated topological structures are analyzed using effective two-level models. These classifications are further substantiated by numerical simulations in optical microcavities with three scatterers, where EPs emerge in the complex frequency spectrum. By encircling different EP pairs in parameter space, we demonstrate that the resulting topological features such as trivial or non-trivial braiding and Berry phase accumulation are directly linked to the vorticity structure and eigenmode evolution. In particular, we show that the eigenstate projection onto a basis state near EPs manifests as chiral optical modes in microcavities, providing an experimentally accessible signature of the underlying topological structure. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding multi-EP topology and offer practical pathways toward their realization and control in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial Bifocal and Optical Vortex Generation of DNG Materials Unveiled by Generalized Transfer Matrix Method and Matrix Fourier Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation and analysis of exotic physical phenomena facilitated by metamaterials have emerged as a compelling area of interest in physics, material science, and engineering. However, there remains a lack of suitable theoretical tools for scrutinizing light-matter interactions in metamedia, particularly those involving distinct constitutive tensors, such as polarization cross-coupling or non-reciprocal propagation induced by bianisotropy. In this research, we apply the generalized transfer matrix method and matrix Fourier Optics to devise a novel hybrid methodology adept at efficiently tracing an optical beam as it propagates through transverse-homogeneous, longitudinal-inhomogeneous bianisotropic media. Our proof-of-concept demonstration elucidates the interaction between a nonparaxial Gaussian incident beam with various linear/circular polarizations and a mismatched anisotropic double-negative (DNG) metamaterial. We unveil the nontrivial bifocal effect and optical vortex (OV) generation and focusing phenomena in a three-dimensional environment, findings that have not been documented previously. Significantly, the proposed efficient methodology holds the potential for application in examining more promising physical phenomena exhibited by intricate metamaterials, enabling a more visually rigorous approach.</description>

      <title>Giant near-field nonlinear electrophotonic effects in an angstrom-scale plasmonic junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmons facilitate a strong confinement and enhancement of near-field light, offering exciting opportunities to enhance nonlinear optical responses at the nanoscale. However, despite significant advancements, the electrically tunable range of the nonlinear optical responses at nanometer-scale plasmonic structures remains limited to a few percents per volt. Here, we transcend the limitation of the nanometer regime by expanding the concept of electrophotonics into angstrom-scale platform, enabling high-performance modulation of near-field nonlinear optical responses inaccessible in prior architectures. We demonstrate ~2000% enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) within 1 V of voltage application by utilizing an angstrom-scale plasmonic gap between a metallic tip and a flat metal substrate in a scanning tunneling microscope. Extending this near-field SHG scheme to sum-frequency generation that is accompanied by large frequency upconversion, we also found that such giant electrical modulation of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena is effective over mid-infrared to visible broad wavelength range. Our results and concepts lay the foundation for developing near-field-based angstrom-scale nonlinear electrophotonics with significant modulation depth at low driving voltage.</description>

      <title>Diffraction-Unlimited Tip-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Vibrational Nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a powerful second-order nonlinear spectroscopic technique that provides detailed insights into molecular structures and absolute orientations at surfaces and interfaces. However, conventional SFG based on far-field schemes suffers from the diffraction limit of light, which inherently averages spectroscopic information over micrometer-scale regions and obscures nanoscale structural inhomogeneity. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by leveraging a highly confined optical near field within a tip-substrate nanogap of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), pushing the spatial resolution of SFG down to ~10 nm, a nearly two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over conventional far-field SFG. By capturing tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectra concurrently with STM scanning, we demonstrate the capability to resolve nanoscale variation in molecular adsorption structures across distinct interfacial domains. To rigorously interpret the observed TE-SFG spectra, we newly developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for the TE-SFG process and confirm via numerical simulations that the TE-SFG response under our current experimental conditions is dominantly governed by the dipole-field interactions, with negligible contributions from higher-order multipole effects. The dominance of the dipole mechanism ensures that the observed TE-SFG spectra faithfully reflect not only nanoscale interfacial structural features but also absolute up/down molecular orientations. This study presents the first experimental realization of diffraction-unlimited second-order nonlinear vibrational SFG nanoscopy, opening a new avenue for nanoscale domain-specific investigation of molecular structures and dynamics within inhomogeneous interfacial molecular systems beyond the conventional far-field SFG and STM imaging.</description>

      <title>Projector Method for Nonlinear Light-Matter Interactions and Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic projector-based Feynman diagram framework that intrinsically encodes quantum geometry for nonlinear optical responses. By explicitly incorporating geometric quantities such as the quantum geometric tensor, quantum hermitian connection, and triple phase product, the method ensures component-wise gauge invariance and seamlessly extends to multiband systems, enabling accurate calculations of quantum geometry and nonlinear optical responses. We derive the projector formalism in Wannier function basis and implement the \textit{ab initio} calculations of shift current in GeS, demonstrating excellent agreement with the sum rule and Wilson loop approaches. This work extends projector-based representations within the Wannier functions basis, offering an efficient and reliable tool for investigating nonlinear light-matter interactions and quantum geometry in realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Mechanical Motions in Non-linear Optical Organic Micro Ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the multifaceted dynamic motion and three-dimensional (3D) spatial manipulation of organic micro ring resonators (MRRs). The MRRs are fabricated via surface-tension-assisted self-assembly of 2,2'-((1E,1'E)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))bis(3,5-dibromophenol) (HDBP), exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) emission and frequency comb-type whispering gallery modes. Interestingly, the MRRs are micromechanically reconfigurable into various strained architectures, including lifting, transferring, vertical standing, axial spinning, and wheel-like rolling, using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip. The MRRs retained their photonic traits throughout these dynamic motions, underscoring their mechanical robustness. Notably, the demonstration of axial spinning and rolling locomotion extends the manipulation capabilities beyond two-dimensional control, enabling complete 3D spatial control. These results establish a foundational platform for next-generation NLO mechanophotonic systems, where reconfigurable smart and soft photonic elements can be dynamically controlled with high spatial precision.</description>

      <title>Time Crystals in Actively Mode-locked Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of discrete time-crystal phases and crystallites in an actively mode-locked semiconductor laser. By tuning either the bias current or the modulation frequency, the system undergoes a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from the harmonically mode-locked state towards robust, highly coherent time-crystal states that persist indefinitely. Two equivalent time-crystal configurations, shifted by one driving period, can coexist as domains separated by sharp, long-lived boundaries analogous to domain walls. The phenomenon is quantitatively reproduced by a time-delayed model adapted to the large gain and losses of semiconductor systems. Our findings demonstrate that mode-locked semiconductor lasers offer a readily accessible platform to explore and control non-equilibrium phases of light, enabling practical implementations of time-crystal physics in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of optical feedback-controlled emission of dual-wavelength lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual and multi-wavelength lasers, i.e., lasers with the ability to emit at two or more wavelengths in a controlled fashion, represent an exciting new twist in laser physics. Harnessing the mode competition to control them better remains, however, a challenge. In this work, we numerically explore the effect of optical feedback on the emission properties of a dual-wavelength laser using a rate equation model. We focus on switching capability and investigate the impact of key laser and feedback parameters. We connect the emergence of simultaneous emission to a lower cross-saturation between modes, and demonstrate that robust switching can be achieved using a short feedback cavity and a sufficiently strong feedback. In particular and in contrast to previous publications, we highlight that the feedback phase difference between the two modes is not a critical parameter. Our results are consistent with recent experimental observations, supporting the relevance of feedback-based control techniques for multi-wavelength lasers.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Electric Field and Zitterbewegung on a Photonic Frequency Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthetic frequency dimension, which realizes fictitious spatial dimensions from the spectral degree of freedom, has emerged as a promising platform for engineering artificial gauge fields in studying quantum simulations and topological physics with photons. A current central task for frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.</description>

      <title>Photonic Matrix Multiplication Circuit Based on Double Racetrack Resonator Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design framework for photonic matrix multiplication based on programmable photonic integrated circuits using double racetrack (DRT) resonators as building blocks. Here, we analytically demonstrate that the transfer function of the DRT resonator building block resembles that conventional building blocks, such as directional couplers and MZI, making it suitable for building programmable circuits that handle complex matrix calculations. Using this new DRT resonators building block, a 3-by-3 photonic processor is implemented and validated through full-wave Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, and scalability is further analysed using hybrid FEM-circuit modelling. Additionally, we implement a low-pass filter as a non-unitary system example, showcasing the flexibility of the approach. Results confirm high fidelity between simulated and analytical models, supporting the viability of DRT resonators for reconfigurable photonic circuits. We believe that the proposed DRT resonator building blocks have the potential to complement and integrate with other previously reported blocks, thereby enhancing the fidelity and expanding the application scope of programmable photonic integrated circuits, particularly for all-optical signal processing in communication systems and for integration within microwave photonics platforms targeting emerging telecommunications technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum dots emission enhancement via coupling with an epsilon-near-zero sublayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters operating at telecom wavelengths are essential for the advancement of quantum technologies, particularly in the development of integrated on-chip devices for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Coupling resonant structures to a near-zero-index (NZI) environment has been shown to enhance their optical performance by both increasing spontaneous emission rates and improving emission directionality. In this work, we comparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell) quantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two different sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the epsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the epsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence lifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a relative emission cone narrowing from 17.6{\deg} to 10.3{\deg}. These results underline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the spectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the potential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration into next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility, fabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI materials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum optical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Frozen differential scattering in reconfigurable complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of transmission to the input wavefront is a hallmark feature of complex media and the basis for wavefront shaping techniques. Yet, intriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is "frozen" (agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the complex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we unveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential scattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media. Specifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix of any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential output signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's coherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential output mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise management. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a rich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then, we demonstrate "customized freezing" by optimizing the configuration of additional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as envisioned for 6G networks. We impose particular shapes of the frozen differential output mode, and maximize its signal-to-thermal-noise ratio. Potential applications include filtering and stabilization of differential wavefronts, as well as imaging, sensing, and communication in complex media.</description>

      <title>Morphologies of caustics studied by catastrophe charged-particle optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the topologies of caustics observed in instruments that employ charged particles, such as electron and ion microscopes. These geometrical figures are studied here using catastrophe theory. The application of this geometrical theory to our optical situation has enabled us to analytically reproduce the behaviours of various caustics. The interest lies mainly in the universal nature of these results since our treatment requires no prior knowledge of the optical configuration, but only a smart definition of the control space. This universal approach has finally made it possible to extract mathematical relationships between the aberration coefficients of any optical system, which were hidden by the complexity of optical trajectories but revealed by the set of catastrophes in the control space. These results provide a glimpse for future applications of caustics in the development of new corrected optical systems, especially for ions-based devices.</description>

      <title>Programmable 200 GOPS Hopfield-inspired photonic Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast, and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, like D-Wave's cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs. Here, we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks, our architecture solves fully-connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings), and $&gt;$41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system leverages cascaded thin-film lithium niobate modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier, and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential $&gt;$200 giga-operations per second for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for Max-Cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning and lattice protein folding - benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system leverages inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP - traditionally used in optical communications - within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing, and analog AI.</description>

      <title>Intermittent chaos in an optomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics, manifesting as irregular and unpredictable behavior across various physical systems. Among the diverse routes to chaos, intermittent chaos is a distinct transition pathway, characterized by the temporal or spatial alternation between periodic and chaotic motions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, optomechanically induced intermittent chaos in an optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Specifically, the system evolves from stable periodic oscillation through an intermittent-chaos regime before fully developing into chaotic motion. As system parameters vary, the proportion of chaotic motion in the time-domain increases asymptotically until chaotic dynamics dominates entirely. Moreover, it is counterintuitive that, intermittent chaos can act as noise of a favorable intensity compared with purely periodic or fully chaotic states, and enhance rather than reduce system's responses in nonlinear ultrasonic detection. These findings not only deepen the comprehensive understanding of chaos formation but also broaden its potential applications in high-precision sensing and information processing.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic coprocessor for linear operations with input-size-independent calculation time based on open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear operations, e.g., vector-matrix or vector-vector multiplications, are core operations of modern neural networks. To diminish computational time, these operations are implemented by parallel computations using different coprocessors. In this work we show that open quantum system consisting of bosonic modes and interacting with bosonic reservoirs can be used as analog coprocessor implementing multiple vector-matrix multiplications with stochastic matrices in parallel. Input vectors are encoded in occupancies of reservoirs, and output result is presented by stationary energy flows. The operation takes time needed for the system's transition to non-equilibrium stationary state independently on number of the reservoirs, i.e., on the input vector dimension. The computations are accompanied by entropy growth. We construct a direct mapping between open quantum systems and electrical crossbar structures, showing that dissipation rates multiplied by OQS's modes frequencies can be seen as conductivities, reservoirs' occupancies can be seen as potentials, and stationary energy flows can be seen as electric currents.</description>

      <title>Single-pixel edge enhancement of object via convolutional filtering with localized vortex phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopy is an essential tool in imaging research, and the edge-enhanced microscope by using the vortex filter is of particular interest as an optical information processing that highlights amplitude and phase edges of object in all directions. The application of this technique is not limited to the visible range, but edge enhancement of object in invisible wavelength is also crucial for near-infrared fluorescence and electronic circuit inspection through silicon semiconductors. One disadvantage of near-infrared imaging is that digital cameras such as CCD and CMOS become much more expensive than cameras for the visible spectrum. As an cost-effective method to implement invisible edge enhancement, the Fourier single-pixel imaging has already been proposed without using a camera, but using a single-pixel detector. However, this method requires 3 or 4 times more single-pixel measurements due to the three-phase or four-phase shift to detect optical complex amplitude in Fourier domain. In response, we propose a method for single-pixel edge enhancement of object via convolutional filtering with a localized vortex phase, eliminating the extra single-pixel measurements required by the phase-shifting method. Our simulation results show that the correlation coefficient between the ideal edges of an object and the edge enhanced by our proposed method is 0.95, indicating that our method is effective way to detect the edges. This novel and effective approach for enhancing and detecting the edges of object can be valuable in various invisible imaging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavelength independent detection and discrimination of laser radiation has been performed by detecting the "self coherence" of an incoming light source using interferometry with photon sensitive detectors. The system successfully discriminates between coherent and incoherent sources. Detection of scattered laser light has been performed across the visible spectrum with no filters, internal or external source comparisons. The ultimate detection sensitivity was shown to be 140fW for a continuous wave (CW) HeNe laser at 632nm. We believe this to be the most sensitive wavelength independent detection of a CW laser so far reported</description>

      <title>Theory of the two-photon Franz-Keldysh effect and electric-field-induced bichromatic coherent control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of a constant electric field on two-photon absorption in a semiconductor is calculated using an independent-particle theory. The theoretical framework is an extension of a theory of the one-photon Franz-Keldysh effect [Wahlstrand and Sipe, Phys. Rev. B 82, 075206 (2010)]. The theory includes the effect of the constant field, including field-induced coupling between closely spaced bands, in the electronic wavefunctions and calculates optical absorption perturbatively. Numerical calculations are performed using a 14-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot\mathbf{p}$ band structure model for GaAs. For all nonzero tensor elements, field-enabled two-photon absorption (TPA) below the band gap and Franz-Keldysh oscillations in the TPA spectrum are predicted, with a generally larger effect in tensor elements with more components parallel to the constant electric field direction. Some tensor elements that are zero in the absence of a field become nonzero in the presence of the constant electric field and depend on its sign. Notably, these elements are linear in the electric field to lowest order and may be substantial away from band structure critical points at room temperature and/or with a non-uniform field. Electric-field-induced changes in the carrier injection rate due to interference between one- and two-photon absorption are also calculated. The electric field enables this bichromatic coherent control process for polarization configurations where it is normally forbidden, and also modifies the spectrum of the process for configurations where it is allowed by crystal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Direct writing laser (DWL) grayscale lithography is introduced as a novel fabrication technique for multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) phase masks, enabling direct transfer of precise depth profiles onto substrates via reactive ion etching and subsequent reflective coating. An MPLC system employing these masks achieves 92% fidelity in converting a Gaussian (TEM (0,0)) input to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG(0,0)) mode. The fabricated masks exhibit sub-10 nm vertical resolution, surface roughness below 3 nm, and an R-squared value of 0.976. This method provides a scalable alternative to conventional multi-step lithographic fabrication for advanced photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optical Throughput and Etendue Revisited: Introducing the Optogeometric Factor for Pixel Level Quantitative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper formally defines the optogeometric factor $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ as a pixel level quantity of geometric optical throughput, with units of $\text{m}^2\cdot\text{sr}$ (or $\text{m}^2$ in reduced form), derived from \'etendue. Whereas \'etendue is conventionally used to characterise the throughput of entire optical systems, the optogeometric factor is localised to the level of a single detector pixel, providing a new way to link scene radiance to the radiant flux actually collected by that pixel.
  Although examples are drawn from infrared thermography, the formulation is general and applies equally to visible, ultraviolet, and Xray imaging systems.
  The underlying radiometric principle is well established: classical radiometry already relates radiance, area, and solid angle. The new contribution of this work is to isolate that pixel level term, to name it as $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$, and to derive its explicit forms. In this way, $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ acts as a compact and universal descriptor of pixel level radiometric throughput.
  The present study builds on an earlier quantitative thermography equation that already expressed the radiant flux collected by an individual pixel. In that formulation, the scene based form of the optogeometric factor was present only implicitly, embedded in the derivation. Here, $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ is made explicit as an independent radiometric quantity, providing a more transparent and general framework that links pixel level geometry to radiometric throughput.
  Two formulations of $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ are derived: a scene based form, expressed through the pixel footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed through the pixel pitch and optical $f$number. They coincide numerically under the paraxial approximation and other conditions discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Thermal-noise Limits to the Frequency Stability of Burned Spectral Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Techniques in frequency stabilization of lasers to fixed-spacer optical cavities have advanced to the point where the ultimate frequency stabilities are limited by thermal noise in the cavity materials for standard cavity configurations at room temperature. The use of spectral-hole burning (SHB) in laser stabilization has produced promising results in early experiments. In this letter we explore the thermal-noise limits to frequency stability in burned spectral holes. We compile known material parameters for a typical system used in SHB experiments (Eu 3+ doped Y 2 SiO 5 ) to make numerical estimates for the fundamental thermal-noise induced frequency instability in spectral-holes for the liquid-helium temperature and dilution temperature cases. These efforts can guide the design of future SHB experiments and clarify which important material parameters remain to be measured.</description>
