      <title>Axion electrodynamics and giant magnetic birefringence in Weyl excitonic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic (EM) response of the excitonic insulator phase of time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Because of the chiral anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect in the parent WSM, the phase of the exciton condensate couples to the EM fields as a massive dynamical axion. Although the translational symmetry of the WSM is broken in the excitonic insulator state, the axion field is not related to the phase of the sliding exciton density wave. The axion mass is generated by the inter-band matrix elements of electron-electron interactions, and is much smaller than the gap in the single-particle spectrum. Due to the small axion mass, in the presence of a magnetic field, the axion coupling to EM fields produces giant anisotropic polarizability and birefringence. The photon-axion hybridization produces a polariton resonance near the axion gap.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic waveguides in two-dimensional materials: a quantum mechanical description using semiclassical techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmons are likely to play an important role in integrated photonic ciruits, because they strongly interact with light and can be confined to subwavelength scales. These plasmons can be guided and controlled by plasmonic waveguides, which can be created by patterning different materials or by structuring the dielectric environment. We have constructed a semi-analytical theory to describe plasmonic waveguides, and, more generally, plasmons in spatially inhomogeneous systems. Our theory employs techniques from semiclassical analysis, and is therefore applicable when the electron wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of changes in the system parameters. We obtain an effective classical Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of quantum plasmons, given by the Lindhard function with spatially varying parameters. Adding the wave-like character of the plasmons to the classical trajectories generated by this Hamiltonian, we find two different mechanisms for waveguiding. In the first case, a localized plasmonic state arises due to total internal reflection similar to photonic waveguides. The second mechanism relies on a varying dielectric environment, which locally modifies the screening of the electrons. Here, a quasi-localized state arises due to local changes in the amplitude of the plasmonic excitation. Our results provide a solid basis to understand previous numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Universal Anyon Tunneling in a Chiral Luttinger Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge modes of fractional quantum Hall liquids are described by chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Despite many years of experimental investigation fractional quantum Hall edge modes remain enigmatic with significant discrepancies between experimental observations and detailed predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Here we report measurements of tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes at $\nu=1/3$ across a quantum point contact fabricated on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure designed to promote a sharp confinement potential. We present evidence for tunneling of anyons through an $\nu=1/3$ incompressible liquid that exhibits universal scaling behavior with respect to temperature, source-drain bias, and barrier transmission, as originally proposed by Wen[1,2]. We measure the tunneling exponent $g = 0.334 \pm 0.001$, consistent with the scaling dimension $\Delta = g/2 = 1/6$ for a Laughlin quasiparticle at the edge. When combined with measurements of the fractional charge $e^*=e/3$ and the recently observed anyonic statistical angle $\theta_a=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, the measured tunneling exponent fully characterizes the topological order of the primary Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$.</description>

      <title>Orbital-excitation-dominated magnetization dissipation and quantum oscillation of Gilbert damping in Fe films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys, but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.</description>

      <title>Polar Vortex Superstructure and Its Coupling with Correlated Electrons in Quasiperiodic Moire Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale polar structures are significant for understanding polarization processes in low-dimensional systems and hold potential for developing high-performance electronics. Here, we demonstrate a polar vortex superstructure arising from the reconstructed moir\'e patterns in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals spatially modulated charge polarization, while theoretical simulations indicate that the in-plane polarization field forms an array of polar vortices. Notably, this polar field is gate-tunable, exhibiting an unconventional gate-tunable polar sliding and screening process. Moreover, its interaction with electron correlations in twisted bilayer graphene leads to modulated correlated states. Our findings establish moir\'e pattern reconstruction as a powerful strategy for engineering nanoscale polar structures and emergent quantum phases in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions for the spin wave frequencies and precession amplitudes in monolayer and antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer CrSBr under in-plane external magnetic fields. The analysis covers the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and canted phases, demonstrating that the spin wave frequencies in all phases are tunable by the applied magnetic field. We discuss the roles of intra- and interlayer exchange interactions, triaxial anisotropy, and intralayer dynamic dipolar fields in controlling the magnetization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects in two-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the nontrivial thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional topological systems. For the Chern insulator, we show that the Seebeck coefficient is fully determined by the Kelvin formula, while the Nernst coefficient vanishes. For a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interactions we reveal how the Berry curvature affects the thermoelectric coefficients, and derive the Mott-like equation for thermopower. We predict a strong variation of the thermopower of a two-dimensional topological insulator with time-reversal symmetry in the ballistic and dissipative regimes. The Kelvin formula applies in the ballistic regime, while the Mott formula holds in the dissipative regime. Importantly, in a system with trapezoidal geometry, the combination of ballistic and dissipative regimes leads to the anomalous Nernst effect. Finally, we analyze a two-dimensional Anderson insulator, where edge modes show distinct temperature behavior of the Seebeck coefficient near the weak localization-strong localization transition temperatures. In the trivial phase, the thermopower exhibits a strong power law temperature dependence, while in the topological phase both power law and exponential dependences coexist.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of transport by helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial band structure of a material may give rise to special states that are confined to the material's boundary and protected against disorder and scattering. Quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) is a paradigmatic example of phenomenon in which such states appear in the presence of time-reversal symmetry in two dimensions. Whereas the spatial structure of these helical edge states has been largely studied, their dynamic properties are much less understood. We design a microwave experiment mimicking QSHE and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of unidirectional transport of optical angular momentum (or pseudospin) by edge states. Pseudospin-polarized signal propagation is shown to be immune to scattering by defects introduced along the edge. Its velocity is two to three orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light in the free space, which may have important consequences for practical applications of topological edge states in modern optical and quantum-information technologies.</description>

      <title>Photon-drag photovoltaic effects and quantum geometric nature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) generates a direct current photocurrent under uniform irradiation and is a nonlinear optical effect traditionally studied in non-centrosymmetric materials. The two main origins of BPVE are the shift and injection currents, arising from transitions in electron position and electron velocity during optical excitation, respectively. Recently, it was proposed that photon-drag effects could unlock BPVE in centrosymmetric materials. However, experimental progress remains limited. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of photon-drag effects inducing BPVE (photon-drag BPVE). Notably, we find that photon-drag BPVE can be directly linked to quantum geometric tensors. Additionally, we propose that photon-drag shift currents can be fully isolated from other current contributions in non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials. We apply our theory explicitly to the 2D topological insulator $1T'$-WTe$_2$. Furthermore, we investigate photon-drag BPVE in a centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal, where we demonstrate that linearly polarized light generates photon-drag shift currents.</description>

      <title>Holes in silicon are heavier than expected: transport properties of extremely high mobility electrons and holes in silicon MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of the silicon-oxide interface plays a crucial role in fabricating reproducible silicon spin qubits. In this work we characterize interface quality by performing mobility measurements on silicon Hall bars. We find a peak electron mobility of nearly $40,000\,\text{cm}^2/\text{Vs}$ in a device with a $21\,\text{nm}$ oxide layer, and a peak hole mobility of about $2,000\,\text{cm}^2/\text{Vs}$ in a device with $8\,\text{nm}$ oxide, the latter being the highest recorded mobility for a p-type silicon MOSFET. Despite the high device quality, we note an order-of-magnitude difference in mobility between electrons and holes. By studying additional n-type and p-type devices with identical oxides, and fitting to transport theory, we show that this mobility discrepancy is due to valence band nonparabolicity. The nonparabolicity endows holes with a density-dependent transverse effective mass ranging from $0.6m_0$ to $0.7m_0$, significantly larger than the usually quoted bend-edge mass of $0.22m_0$. Finally, we perform magnetotransport measurements to extract momentum and quantum scattering lifetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin and integer quantum Hall effects are two cousins of topological phase transitions in two-dimensional electronic systems. Their close relationship makes it possible to transform spin to integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional topological superconductors by continuous increase in a symmetry breaking Zeeman magnetic field. We study peculiarities of bulk-edge correspondence and a fate of massless edge and bulk topological (instantons) excitations at such the crossover.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.</description>

      <title>Theory of Slidetronics in Ferroelectric van der Waals Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertically stacked layers derived from non-ferroelectric monolayers offer a promising route to two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, where polarization switching occurs via interlayer sliding at sub-unit cell scales. Here, we develop a theory of slidetronics based on the notion that sliding-induced switching $P \rightarrow P'$ can also be achieved by applying an appropriate point-group operator $G$ to the entire system, such that $P' = G P$. Interlayer sliding and the transformation induced by the generator $G$ are thus equivalent in describing the relationship between the initial and final layer configurations. From this symmetry principle, we deduce that slidetronics can be classified by generators $G$; the generator $G$ must act as a symmetry operator for the constituent layers, while it is not a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole; for a given 2D material, $G$ determines the interlayer sliding required for polarization switching; and sliding-induced complete polarization inversion is impossible in bilayers but can be realized in multilayers (e.g., PdSe$_2$ trilayers). These findings provide a framework for designing 2D ferroelectrics with targeted polarization-switching properties, as demonstrated through case studies of real materials.</description>

      <title>Noise-to-current ratio divergence as a fingerprint of dispersing Majorana edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definitive detection of Majorana modes in topological superconductors is a key issue in condensed matter physics. Here we propose a smoking-gun experiment for the detection of one-dimensional dispersing Majorana edge modes, based on theoretical results for multi-terminal transport in a setup consisting of two normal metal leads and a topological superconductor. In the proposed device, the unpaired nature of the Majorana edge modes inherently leads to the absence of the charge current in the linear response regime, while the current fluctuation remains significant. Therefore, the divergence in the noise-to-current ratio serves as unambiguous evidence for the presence of the dispersing Majorana edge modes. We reach this conclusion analytically, without relying on any specific model of topological superconductors. In addition, using tight-binding models of topological-insulator-based topological superconductors, we numerically verify the predicted divergent noise-to-current ratio. We also discuss the application of our proposal to the CoSi$_2$/TiSi$_2$ heterostructure and the iron-based superconductor FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$.</description>

      <title>Digital-Controlled Method of Conveyor-Belt Spin Shuttling in Silicon for Large-Scale Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a digital-controlled conveyor-belt shuttling method for silicon-based quantum processors, addressing the scalability challenges of conventional analog sinusoidal implementations. By placing a switch matrix and low-pass filters in a cryogenic environment, our approach synthesizes near-sinusoidal waveforms from a limited number of DC voltage levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fidelity comparable to analog methods while significantly reducing wiring overhead and power dissipation. Moreover, the design offers robustness against device-level variations, enabling large-scale integration of high-fidelity spin shuttling for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Anomalous Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is an efficient tool for detecting the N\'eel vector in collinear compensated magnets with spin-split bands, known as altermagnets (AMs). Here, we establish design principles for obtaining non-zero anomalous Hall conductivity in the recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) AMs using spin and magnetic group symmetry analysis. We show that only two of the seven nontrivial spin layer groups exhibit an unconventional in-plane AHE in which the N\'eel vector lies within the plane of the Hall current. Through first-principles simulations on bilayers of MnPSe$_3$ and MnSe, we demonstrate the validity of our group theoretic framework for obtaining AHE with $d$ and $i$-wave altermagnetic orders, depending on the stacking of the bilayers. We find that the spin group symmetry is successful in determining the linear and cubic dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity in N\'eel vector space, although AHE is a relativistic effect. This work shows that the AHE in 2D AMs can probe the altermagnetic order and N\'eel vector reversal, thereby facilitating the miniaturization of altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnetism has sparked renewed interest in the growth of epitaxial films of the NiAs-phase polymorph of CrSb. This paper describes the magnetron sputtering-based fabrication and characterization of high-quality single crystalline CrSb(0001) thin films supported by an isostructural non-magnetic PtSb buffer. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that the films are phase-pure and possess a very high crystalline quality (mosaicity ~0.05 deg), while also being free of extended crystallographic defects. Both scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirm their smooth and homogeneous topography. Additionally, the elemental composition of our films was found to be close to stoichiometric via electron probe microanalysis and X-ray fluorescence. Thus, the developed samples represent an ideal platform for further investigation of the material properties of CrSb.</description>

      <title>Multiple magnetic states, valley electronics, and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional Janus XYZH (X = Sc, Y, La, Y = Cl, Br, I, and Z = S, Se, Te): From monolayers to bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the coupling between layer, magnetism, valley, and topology in two-dimensional (2D) materials is an important approach to deepen our understanding of materials properties. We propose 27 stable ferromagnetic semiconductor monolayers of Janus XYZH (X = Sc, Y, La, Y = Cl, Br, I, and Z = S, Se, Te). All these monolayers exhibit spontaneous valley polarization, forming ferrovalley (FV) monolayers, showing anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect. By applying external strain, the topological phase transitions including quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect can be introduced. In the ScBrSH bilayer system, AA and AB stacking configurations were constructed through interlayer sliding and rotational operation. The bilayer system exhibits interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with spontaneous valley polarization differing from the FV observed in monolayers. The sliding ferroelectricity observed in the AA stacking indicates that the system exhibits significant multiferroic characteristics. Further analysis shows that interlayer sliding can introduce a layer polarization anomalous valley Hall (LPAVH) effect, which can be precisely controlled by tuning the direction of the ferroelectric polarization. Upon applying external strain, the quantum layer spin Hall (QLSH) effect observed during the topological phase transition in the bilayer can be regarded as the superposition of two QAH monolayers. Furthermore, applying a twisting operation to the bilayer induces unexpected altermagnetism. Our study systematically reveals the rich physical properties of 2D XYZH materials, providing important theoretical foundations and guidance for the design and development of next-generation quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of propagating waves $V(Qx - \omega t)$ on the electronic states of quantum materials, focusing on Floquet-Bloch states of relativistic fermions. These waves include laser light, polaritons, acoustic waves, and sliding density waves, each propagating at different speeds. Generically, we categorize the fields based on their speed relative to the Fermi velocity into time-like, light-like, and space-like waves, finding that the resulting electronic states exhibit distinct characteristics in each cases. For 3D Dirac electrons in circularly polarized waves, we identify emergent Floquet Weyl bands, which can transition into Type-II Weyl states near a critical point. The effects of Floquet band engineering are significantly enhanced by Lorentz contraction, which reaches its maximum when the wave speed approaches but slightly exceeds the Fermi velocity, leading to the realization of a shockwave-like state. The shockwave-like states are related to the near adiabatic dynamics via Lorentz transformation.</description>

      <title>Enantiomer-Selective Magnetoresistance in Chiral Gold Nanocrystals by Magnetic Control of Surface Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral nanomaterials offer intriguing possibilities for novel electronic and chemical applications. Here, we report the discovery of an enantiomer-selective magnetoresistance effect in chiral gold nanocrystals. Based on precise control of nanocrystal chiral morphology using amino acid-directed synthesis, we demonstrate that an external magnetic field can dramatically modulate resistance in an enantiomer-specific manner. For a given enantiomer, a magnetic field in one direction alters the resistance by dozens of times, while the opposite field direction leaves it unchanged. This asymmetric response reverses for the opposite enantiomer and are reproduced in both single nanocrystals by conduction atomic force microscopy and nanocrystal thin films in solid state devices. We attribute this phenomenon to a chirality-driven charge pumping effect, where the interplay between the chiral morphology and the magnetic field selectively modifies the surface potential. The magnitude and sign of the magnetoresistance can be further tuned by the surface chemistry of the nanocrystal, as demonstrated through sulfide treatment. Our findings reveal a new form of chirality-dependent magnetoresistance, distinct from previously known effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity and electric magnetochiral anisotropy. The ability to remotely control surface potentials of chiral nanostructures using magnetic fields could enable novel approaches in catalysis, drug delivery, and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the origin of spin current in spintronic terahertz emitters and its imprint on their electromagnetic radiation via time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin current flowing between femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP)-driven ferromagnetic metal and adjacent normal metal (NM) hosting strong spin-orbit coupling is invariably invoked to explain terahertz (THz) radiation believed to be emitted solely by NM layer. Despite being such a central concept, the microscopic origin of interlayer spin current remains vague. Here, we employ recently developed [A. Kefayati {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 133}, 136704 (2024)] time-dependent density functional theory plus Jefimenko equations approach to extract spin current between Co and NM=Pt or NM=W layer where Co is driven by fsLP responsible for its demagnetization, i.e., shrinking of its magnetization vector, $M^y(t)/M^y(t=0)&lt;1$. By comparing time dependence of spin current with those of other relevant quantities, we find that: ({\em i}) spin current is generated by demagnetization dynamics because it {\em follows} closely $dM^y/dt$, thus it is an example of quantum pumping phenomenon that cannot be captured by phenomenological notions (such as ``spin voltage'') and related semiclassical transport theories; ({\em ii}) time dependence of pumped spin current {\em does not follow} closely that of charge current emerging within NM layer via spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms; ({\em iii}) THz emission can be governed by {\em both} charge current (i.e., its time derivative entering the Jefimenko equations) within Co layer or NM layer, but in different times frames. We also unravel a special case of NM=W where spin-to-charge conversion by the inverse spin Hall effect and its contribution to THz emission is suppressed, despite large spin Hall angle of W, because of localization of excited electrons onto the outer unfilled $d$-orbitals of W.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction of Three-Dimensional Magnetisation in a Nanowire Structure Using Electron Holographic Vector Field Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods for characterisation of 3D magnetic spin structures are necessary to advance the performance of 3D magnetic nanoscale technologies. However, as the component dimensions approach the nanometre range, it becomes more challenging to analyse 3D magnetic configurations with the appropriate spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a method based on Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in which model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) is used to reconstruct the most probable magnetisation in an exemplar nanostructure. This method is based on relating electron phase measurements to the magnetic configuration of the nanostructure, and therefore, the method is subject to certain limitations. In this proof-of-concept experiment, MBIR was tested on an L-shaped ferromagnetic cobalt nanowire, fabricated using focused electron beam induced deposition. Off-axis electron holography was used to acquire a tomographic tilt series of electron holograms, which were analysed to measure magnetic electron phase shift over two tilt arcs with up to $ \pm 60$ degree tilt range. Then, a 3D magnetisation vector field consistent with the tomographic phase measurements was reconstructed, revealing multiple magnetic domains within the nanowire. The reconstructed magnetisation is accurate for magnetic domains larger than 50 nm, and higher resolution can be achieved by the continued development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ($\theta$) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moir\'e potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying $\theta$. Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.</description>

      <title>ZrN nucleation layer provides backside ohmic contact to MBE-grown GaN nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembled GaN nanowires are typically grown on Si substrates with convenient nucleation layers. Light-emitting devices based on arrays of GaN nanowires require that the nucleation layer is electrically conductive and optically nontransparent to prevent the absorption of generated light in the Si substrate. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxial growth of GaN nanowires on ZrN nucleation layers sputtered on sapphire and demonstrates that ZrN provides ohmic contact to dense vertical arrays of n-type GaN nanowires. The ohmic nature of the ZrN/n-type GaN nanowire contact is evidenced by the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of individual as-grown nanowires using nanomanipulators in a scanning electron microscope. The limitations and advantages of single-nanowire measurements are discussed, and approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the measurement of single NWs with a p-n junction, exhibiting highly rectifying characteristics.</description>

      <title>Engineering flux-controlled flat bands and topological states in a Stagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Stagome lattice, a variant of the Kagome lattice, where one can make any of the bands completely flat by tuning an externally controllable magnetic flux. This systematically allows the energy of the flat band to coincide with the Fermi level. We have analytically calculated the compact localized states associated to each of these flat bands appearing at different values of the magnetic flux. We also show that, this model features nontrivial topological properties with distinct integer values of the Chern numbers as a function of the magnetic flux. We argue that this mechanism for making any of the bands exactly flat could be of interest to address the flat-band superconductivity in such a system. Additionally, we show that our results are robust even in the presence of a small amount of disorder. Furthermore, we believe that the phenomenon of photonic flat band localization could be studied in the Stagome lattice structure, designed for instance using femtosecond laser induced single-mode waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry of interacting non-Hermitian birefringent Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy spectra of linearly dispersing gapless spin-3/2 Dirac fermions display birefringence, featuring two effective Fermi velocities, thus breaking the space-time Lorentz symmetry. Here, we consider a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of this scenario by introducing a masslike anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator to its Hermitian counterpart. At the microscopic level, a generalized $\pi$-flux square lattice model with imbalance in the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions among spinless fermions between the nearest-neighbor sites gives rise to pseudospin-3/2 NH Dirac fermions in terms of internal, namely sublattice, degrees of freedom. The resulting NH operator shows real eigenvalue spectra over an extended NH parameter regime, and a combination of non-spatial and discrete rotational symmetries protects the gapless nature of such quasiparticles. However, at the brink of dynamic mass generation, triggered by Hubbardlike local interactions, the birefringent parameter always vanishes under coarse grain due to the Yukawa-type interactions with scalar bosonic order-parameter fluctuations. The resulting quantum critical state is, therefore, described by two decoupled copies of spin-1/2 Dirac fermions with a unique terminal Fermi velocity, which is equal to the bosonic order-parameter velocity, thereby fostering an emergent space-time Lorentz symmetry. Furthermore, depending on the internal algebra between the anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator and the candidate mass order, the system achieves the emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry either by maintaining its non-Hermiticity or by recovering a full Hermiticity. We discuss the resulting quantum critical phenomena and possible microscopic realizations of the proposed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Metallic Monolayer Cu(CrSe2)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer stands out for its combined ferromagnetic (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and metallic properties, marking itself as a prominent 2D multiferroic metal. This work studies those properties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show that Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ = 3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily arises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr itinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape magnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is also quite weak, only about 3\% of the intralayer exchange parameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of 1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE state remains stable above room temperature as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by a magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a FE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced by either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\rm C}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but enhances $T_{\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite effect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be explored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Third-order Orbital Corner State and its Realization in Acoustic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three dimensional (3D) third-order topological insulators (TIs) have zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which are three dimensions lower than bulk. Here we investigate the third-order TIs on breathing pyrochlore lattices with p-orbital freedom. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is derived for the p-orbital model, in which we find that the two orthogonal ${\pi}$-type (transverse) hoppings are the key to open a band gap and obtain higher-order topological corner states. We introduce the Z4 berry phase to characterize the bulk topology and analysis the phase diagram. The corner states, demonstrated in a finite structure of a regular tetrahedron, exhibit rich 3D orbital configurations. Furthermore, we design an acoustic system to introduce the necessary ${\pi}$-type hopping and successfully observe the orbital corner states. Our work extends topological orbital corner states to third-order, which enriches the contents of orbital physics and may lead to applications in novel topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>On the relation between fractional charge and statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting dynamics in thin film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. Yet, it remains experimentally challenging to investigate such dynamics with high spectroscopic resolution in both frequency and momentum space, particularly in two-dimensional correlated systems. Here, we leverage Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful and non-invasive tool to study thin-film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), revealing several distinct dynamical phenomena across the superconducting phase diagram. At zero magnetic field and low temperatures, NV depolarization ($T_1$) noise spectroscopy captures the low-frequency (GHz-scale) magnetic noise generated by nodal superconducting quasiparticle excitations, in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Near the critical temperature $T_c \approx 90$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to a sharp reduction of the NV $T_1$. By carefully analyzing the temperature-scaling of $T_1$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS prediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and enabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV $T_1$ near $T_c$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the presence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence ($T_2$) noise spectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale frequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well below $T_c$. Our results establish quantum noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A density matrix formalism is employed to calculate the emission of multi-level excitonic system, highlighting picosecond-scale dynamics and coherent effects such as quantum beats. The results are compared with recent experimental results and indicate some directions of further study. In particular, the effect of Rydberg blockade on the quantum beat phenomenon is discussed.</description>
