      <title>Line shape of soft photon radiation generated at zero angle in an undulator with a dispersive medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of undulator radiation from a bunch of charged particles, taking into account a medium polarization, is considered. In a dispersive medium, at a zero angle, in addition to hard photons, soft photons are also generated. If the wavelength of the soft photons is greater than or equal to the longitudinal size of the microbunches formed during the FEL process, the microbunches radiate coherently. Consequently, the radiation of the bunch will be partially coherent. As a result, intense, quasi-monochromatic, and directed X-ray photon beams are produced, which can have wide practical applications.</description>

      <title>New full simulation model of crystal-based beam extraction using BDSim toolkit enhanced with Geant4 G4ChannelingFastSimModel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of a full simulation model for crystal-based beam extraction based on the BDSim simulation toolkit and the Geant4 G4ChannelingFastSimModel and G4BaierKatkov models. A novel accelerator component, a bent crystal compatible with G4ChannelingFastSimModel, was designed and implemented. As a demonstration, we constructed a complete simulation model of the DESY II Booster Synchrotron within BDSim, incorporating all relevant components. The model accounts for betatron and synchrotron oscillations, as well as radiation losses in the oriented crystal, using G4BaierKatkov. Simulation results demonstrate the successful extraction of a primary monoenergetic 6 GeV electron beam, characterized by a charge of 23 pC, a horizontal beam emittance of 3.6 $\mu$m$\cdot$rad, a vertical beam emittance of 0.32 $\mu$m$\cdot$rad, and an energy spread of 0.008. The model has the potential to significantly accelerate R&amp;D for applications related to crystal-based extraction and collimation in synchrotrons and colliders.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions impose fundamental limits on the brightness of continuous and pulsed electron beams. When multiple electrons leave a field emitter within a space-time volume of femtoseconds and nanometers, their mutual repulsion creates well-defined correlations in energy and time. Such correlations remain undetected in ensemble measurements that average over the statistics of the emission process. Here, we employ event-based and femtosecond-gated detection of photoelectron states to map Coulomb-correlated few-particle phase-space distributions. Inelastic electron-light scattering experiments performed on two-electron states reveal a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space. Reconstructing the phase-space density, we find an overall energy-time dispersion that is distinct from that of the two separated sub-ensembles forming the bimodal distribution. Our findings disentangle correlation-induced and dispersive contributions to the energy-time structure of few-electron pulses and promote future electron microscopy schemes enhanced by multi-electron states.</description>

      <title>Space Charge-Induced Emittance Growth in the Downstream Section of ERL Injectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The injector for ERL-FEL has been widely researched. Unlike traditional linacs, the bunch in the injector for ERLs requires additional deflection and matching section at lower energies. It makes the bunch more susceptible to the effects of the Space Charge. This will lead to a degradation in beam quality. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the impact of space charge on ERL-injector and propose new design concepts to further maintain beam quality.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model, the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>
