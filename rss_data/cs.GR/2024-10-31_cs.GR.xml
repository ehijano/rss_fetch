      <title>NASM: Neural Anisotropic Surface Meshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new learning-based method, NASM, for anisotropic surface meshing. Our key idea is to propose a graph neural network to embed an input mesh into a high-dimensional (high-d) Euclidean embedding space to preserve curvature-based anisotropic metric by using a dot product loss between high-d edge vectors. This can dramatically reduce the computational time and increase the scalability. Then, we propose a novel feature-sensitive remeshing on the generated high-d embedding to automatically capture sharp geometric features. We define a high-d normal metric, and then derive an automatic differentiation on a high-d centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) optimization with the normal metric to simultaneously preserve geometric features and curvature anisotropy that exhibit in the original 3D shapes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework and a large dataset are proposed to construct a high-d Euclidean embedding space for 3D anisotropic surface meshing. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art in anisotropic surface meshing on a large number of surface models from Thingi10K dataset as well as tested on extensive unseen 3D shapes from Multi-Garment Network dataset and FAUST human dataset.</description>

      <title>Implicit-ARAP: Efficient Handle-Guided Deformation of High-Resolution Meshes and Neural Fields via Local Patch Meshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the local patch mesh representation for neural signed distance fields. This technique allows to discretize local regions of the level sets of an input SDF by projecting and deforming flat patch meshes onto the level set surface, using exclusively the SDF information and its gradient. Our analysis reveals this method to be more accurate than the standard marching cubes algorithm for approximating the implicit surface. Then, we apply this representation in the setting of handle-guided deformation: we introduce two distinct pipelines, which make use of 3D neural fields to compute As-Rigid-As-Possible deformations of both high-resolution meshes and neural fields under a given set of constraints. We run a comprehensive evaluation of our method and various baselines for neural field and mesh deformation which show both pipelines achieve impressive efficiency and notable improvements in terms of quality of results and robustness. With our novel pipeline, we introduce a scalable approach to solve a well-established geometry processing problem on high-resolution meshes, and pave the way for extending other geometric tasks to the domain of implicit surfaces via local patch meshing.</description>

      <title>Neural Isometries: Taming Transformations for Equivariant ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world geometry and 3D vision tasks are replete with challenging symmetries that defy tractable analytical expression. In this paper, we introduce Neural Isometries, an autoencoder framework which learns to map the observation space to a general-purpose latent space wherein encodings are related by isometries whenever their corresponding observations are geometrically related in world space. Specifically, we regularize the latent space such that maps between encodings preserve a learned inner product and commute with a learned functional operator, in the same manner as rigid-body transformations commute with the Laplacian. This approach forms an effective backbone for self-supervised representation learning, and we demonstrate that a simple off-the-shelf equivariant network operating in the pre-trained latent space can achieve results on par with meticulously-engineered, handcrafted networks designed to handle complex, nonlinear symmetries. Furthermore, isometric maps capture information about the respective transformations in world space, and we show that this allows us to regress camera poses directly from the coefficients of the maps between encodings of adjacent views of a scene.</description>

      <title>GStex: Per-Primitive Texturing of 2D Gaussian Splatting for Decoupled Appearance and Geometry Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.</description>

      <title>Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.</description>
