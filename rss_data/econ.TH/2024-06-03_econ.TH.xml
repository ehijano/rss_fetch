      <title>Games under the Tiered Deferred Acceptance Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-stage admission system, known as the Tiered Deferred Acceptance mechanism, designed to benefit some schools over others. The current US public school and Chinese college admission systems are two examples. In this system, schools are partitioned into tiers, and the Deferred Acceptance algorithm is applied within each tier. Once assigned, students cannot apply to schools in subsequent tiers. This mechanism is not strategyproof. Therefore, we study the Nash equilibria of the induced preference revelation game. We show that Nash equilibrium outcomes are nested in the sense that merging tiers preserves all equilibrium outcomes. We also identify within-tier acyclicity as a necessary and sufficient condition for the mechanism to implement stable matchings in equilibrium. Our findings suggest that transitioning from the Deferred Acceptance mechanism to the Tiered Deferred Acceptance mechanism may not improve student quality at top-tier schools as intended.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as Economic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, AI has been modeled within economics as a technology that impacts payoffs by reducing costs or refining information for human agents. Our position is that, in light of recent advances in generative AI, it is increasingly useful to model AI itself as an economic agent. In our framework, each user is augmented with an AI agent and can consult the AI prior to taking actions in a game. The AI agent and the user have potentially different information and preferences over the communication, which can result in equilibria that are qualitatively different than in settings without AI.</description>

      <title>Absolute and Relative Ambiguity Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent preferences that exhibit absolute or relative attitudes towards ambiguity without assuming convexity of preferences. Our analysis is motivated by the recent experimental evidence by Baillon and Placido (2019) indicating that ambiguity becomes more tolerable as individuals are better off overall. Decreasing absolute ambiguity aversion is characterized by constant superadditive certainty equivalents and admits an act-dependent variational representation (Maccheroni et al., 2006). Decreasing relative ambiguity aversion relates to positive superhomogeneity and admits an act-dependent confidence preference representation (Chateauneuf and Faro, 2009). We apply our characterizations to retrieve a classic risk sharing result on the efficiency of trade and subjective beliefs of the individuals (Rigotti et al., 2008).</description>

      <title>Local non-bossiness and preferences over colleagues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The student-optimal stable mechanism (DA), the most popular mechanism in school choice, is the only one that is both stable and strategy-proof. However, when DA is implemented, a student can change the schools of others without changing her own. We show that this drawback is limited: a student cannot change her classmates without modifying her school. We refer to this new property as local non-bossiness. Along with strategy-proofness, it ensures a local notion of group strategy-proofness in which manipulating coalitions are restricted to students in the same school. Furthermore, local non-bossiness plays a crucial role in incentives when students have preferences over their colleagues. As long as students first consider the school to which they are assigned and then their classmates, DA induces the only stable and strategy-proof mechanism in this preference domain. To some extent, this is the maximal domain in which a stable and strategy-proof mechanism exists for any school choice context.</description>

      <title>Fair Allocation in Dynamic Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic mechanism design problem where an auctioneer sells an indivisible good to two groups of buyers in every round, for a total of $T$ rounds. The auctioneer aims to maximize their discounted overall revenue while adhering to a fairness constraint that guarantees a minimum average allocation for each group. We begin by studying the static case ($T=1$) and establish that the optimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the overall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the group which otherwise has a lower probability of winning the item. We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on the one hand, commits to a participation reward to incentivize truth-telling, and on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal allocation once more involves subsidization in favor of one group, where the extent of subsidization depends on the difference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the other. Finally, we present an approximation scheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal and fair allocation efficiently.</description>

      <title>Cheap Talking Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07867v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate behaviour of two independent reinforcement learning algorithms playing the Crawford and Sobel (1982) game of strategic information transmission. We adopt memoryless algorithms to capture learning in a static game where a large population interacts anonymously. We show that sender and receiver converge to Nash equilibrium play. The level of informativeness of the sender's cheap talk decreases as the bias increases and, at intermediate level of the bias, it matches the level predicted by the Pareto optimal equilibrium or by the second best one. Conclusions are robust to alternative specifications of the learning hyperparameters and of the game.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>
