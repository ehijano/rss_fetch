Abstract: This is a reaction to the article Symplectic bipotentials, in published form [2] and in preprint form [1] arXiv:2410.23122v1. We give evidence that most of the content of the article [2] is already covered in previous works, partially cited like [7] arXiv:0810.1419 [math.FA], or uncited, like [10] arXiv:1902.04598 [math-ph], [3] arXiv:2304.14158 [math-ph], which already introduced and studied symplectic bipotentials.</description>

      <title>$L_\infty$-morphisms between twisted Courant $r$-Lie algebras and untwisted Courant $(r{+}1)$-Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "Lie infinity algebras and higher analogues of Dirac structures and Courant algebroids" [arXiv:1003.1004], Marco Zambon constructs an $L_\infty$-algebra associated with any higher standard or twisted Courant algebroid (also known as a Vinogradov algebroid), and exhibits an explicit $L_\infty$-morphism from the Lie algebra associated with a standard Lie algebroid twisted by a closed 2-form to the Lie-2 algebra of the standard Courant algebroid. He poses the question of whether analogous canonical $L_\infty$-morphisms exist in higher degrees -- namely, for any standard higher Courant algebroid twisted by a closed $(r+1)$-form. We adfirmatively answer this question, presenting a general framework that naturally yields such canonical $L_\infty$-morphisms for arbitrary $r$, while at the same time clarifying the geometrical and homotopical structures underlying the construction. We also show how this framework accommodates the canonical morphism between Roger's observable $L_\infty$-algebra of a pre-$r$-plectic manifold and the higher Courant algebra described by Zambon and one of the authors in "Observables on multisymplectic manifolds and higher Courant algebroids" [arXiv:2209.05836].</description>

      <title>A Poisson--Poincar\'e--Dulac for Poisson Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Poisson-flat connections with logarithmic poles along a simple normal crossings divisor on a holomorphic Poisson manifold, where flatness is required only along the symplectic foliation. After identifying the relevant logarithmic cotangent Poisson Lie algebroid, we define an Euler--Poisson principal part and a residue theory adapted to the canonical logarithmic Hamiltonian generators. Under a precise nonresonance hypothesis, we establish a Poisson Poincar\'e--Dulac theorem: any logarithmic Poisson-flat connection with prescribed principal part is holomorphically gauge equivalent to a pure Euler--Poisson normal form with constant commuting residues, and this normal form is unique up to Casimir-valued gauge transformations lying in the common centralizer of the residues. To encode both leafwise transport and boundary winding, we construct a twisted leafwise fundamental groupoid via the real oriented blow-up and a 2-pushout that adjoins canonical tangential meridians. In the nonresonant regime, the normal form yields a meridional character determined by the residues, and hence a logarithmic Riemann--Hilbert correspondence in the Poisson setting for this groupoid. Finally, we illustrate the theory with rank-two Poisson modules (Poisson triples) and an explicit family of examples.</description>

      <title>Poisson geometry of truncated polynomials and hypersurface algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symplectic forms on hypersurface algebroids. These are a broad generalization of the $b^{k}$-Poisson structures studied extensively by Miranda, Scott, and collaborators, and their geometry is intimately related to the group of truncated polynomials under composition. They induce Poisson structures that are generically symplectic and drop rank along a codimension $1$ submanifold $W$. However, unlike in the case of $b^{k}$-Poisson structures, the symplectic foliation along $W$ can have non-zero symplectic variation, reflecting the obstruction to extending the order of vanishing of a hypersurface algebroid. In addition to studying the symplectic geometry of these algebroids, in this paper we carry out a detailed study of the Lie algebroid de Rham complex, and develop a method for deforming symplectic forms along paths in a $k$-jet character variety. As a result, we are able to produce a large class of new examples of Poisson structures. Finally, we construct universal hypersurface algebroids and show that in even dimensions they admit canonical Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Actions of Lie 2-algebras and comomentum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of a 2-action of a Lie 2-algebra on an arbitrary manifold M. Furthermore, in [Rog12], given a n-plectic manifold (M, $\omega$), the authors consider a Lie Infinity-algebra L$\infty$ (M, $\omega$), which is a higher analogue of the Poisson algebra of observables associated to a symplectic manifold. This Lie Infinity-algebra reduces to a Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $\omega$) when (M, $\omega$) is 2-plectic. Following ideas of N.L. Delgado [Del18], we introduce the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $\omega$), which generalises the Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $\omega$) and its extension containing Hamiltonian pairs. Given a two-plectic manifold (M, $\omega$) and a Lie 2-algebra g_1 $\oplus$ g_0 acting on M we define a comomentum map as a lift of the action, i.e., as a Lie 2-algebra morphism from g_1 $\oplus$ g_0 to the extension of the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $\omega$). In an appendix, we discuss very explicitly numerous examples, classified according to their algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Shifted cotangent bundles, symplectic groupoids and deformation to the normal cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article generalizes the theory of shifted symplectic structures to the relative context and non-geometric stacks. We describe basic constructions that naturally appear in this theory: shifted cotangent bundles and the AKSZ procedure. Along the way, we also develop the theory of shifted symplectic groupoids presenting shifted symplectic structures on quotients and define a deformation to the normal cone for shifted Lagrangian morphisms.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We give several applications of this procedure, which produced results concerning embeddings of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s, or embeddings of lens spaces as a hypersurface of contact type, in small rational surfaces such as $CP^2\#\overline{CP^2}$ and $S^2\times S^2$, as well as results on the uniqueness or classification of certain symplectic fillings by a $Q$-homology $4$-ball. Further work on the classification of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s is suggested. Moreover, our investigation on the $S^1$-invariant contact structures suggests an interesting and fairly strong upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair $(p,q)$ in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the values $p,q$), and for the symplectic version, we prove the existence of an ``optimal" symplectic rational unicuspidal curve in a rational $4$-manifold which realizes the upper bound for any given Puiseux pair $(p,q)$. Our results also suggest a revisit of the ``symplectic divisorial capping" problem first considered by Li and Mak. Further applications of the techniques developed in this paper hinge upon better understandings for the tightness and fillability criterions of $S^1$-invariant contact structures as well as their (small) symplectic fillings.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Rational Blowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rational blowdown operation in 4-manifold topology replaces a neighborhood of a configuration of spheres by a rational homology ball. Such configurations typically arise from resolutions of surface singularities that admit rational homology disk smoothings. Conjecturally, all such singularities must be weighted homogeneous and belong to certain specific families: Stipsicz-Szab\'o--Wahl constructed QHD smoothings for these families and used Donaldson's theorem to obtain very restrictive necessary conditions on the resolution graphs for singularities with this property. In particular, these results, as well as subsequent work of Bhupal-Stipsicz, show that for certain resolution graphs, the canonical contact structure on the link of the singularity cannot admit a QHD symplectic filling. By contrast, we exhibit Stein rational homology disk fillings for the contact links of an infinite family of rational singularities that are {\em not} weighted homogeneous, producing a new symplectic rational blowdown. Inspiration for our construction comes from de Jong-van Straten's description of Milnor fibers of sandwiched singularities; we use the symplectic analog of de Jong-van Straten theory developed by the second and third authors. The unexpected Stein fillings are built using spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

      <title>Cone structures from a dynamical and probabilistic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14350v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to explore, from a geometric and probabilistic point of view, the dynamics of cone structures adapted to open book decompositions. This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP). This yields geometric obstructions to reaching a point from another point in the phase space of the CR3BP.</description>
