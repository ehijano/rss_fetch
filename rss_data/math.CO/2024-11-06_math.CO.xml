      <title>Corrigendum to the equivalent statement of the Laplacian Spread Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G,$ let $\alpha(G)$ denote its second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue. The Laplacian Spread Conjecture states that $\alpha(G)+\alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1,$ where $\overline{G}$ is the complement of $G.$ In this paper, we have corrected two conclusions: First, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\alpha(G) + \alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1$ is $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 1$ rather than $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ which has been proved in \cite{BS} as demonstrated in our study. Second, we show that the Laplacian spread of balanced digraph $\Gamma$ satisfies $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - \frac{1}{2}$ but not $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - 1$ in \cite{BCEHK}, since inequality $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ does not hold.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate which classes of infinite graphs have the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property (EPP). In addition to the usual EPP, we also consider the following infinite variant of the EPP: a class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs has the $\kappa$-EPP, where $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal, if for any graph $\Gamma$ there are either $\kappa$ disjoint graphs from $\mathcal{G}$ in $\Gamma$ or there is a set $X$ of vertices of $\Gamma$ of size less than $\kappa$ such that $\Gamma - X$ contains no graph from $\mathcal{G}$. In particular, we study the ($\kappa$-)EPP for classes consisting of a single infinite graph $G$. We obtain positive results when the set of induced subgraphs of $G$ is labelled well-quasi-ordered, and negative results when $G$ is not a proper subgraph of itself (both results require some additional conditions). As a corollary, we obtain that every graph which does not contain a path of length $n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ has the EPP and the $\kappa$-EPP. Furthermore, we show that the class of all subdivisions of any tree $T$ has the $\kappa$-EPP for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, and if $T$ is rayless, also the $\aleph_0$-EPP and the EPP.</description>

      <title>A note on the lacking polynomial of the complete bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lacking polynomial is a graph polynomial introduced by Chan, Marckert, and Selig in 2013 that is closely related to the Tutte polynomial of a graph. It arose by way of a generalization of the Abelian sandpile model and is essentially the generating function of the level statistic on the set of recurrent configurations, called stochastically recurrent states, for that model. In this note we consider the lacking polynomial of the complete bipartite graph. We classify the stochastically recurrent states of the stochastic sandpile model on the complete bipartite graphs $K_{2,n}$ and $K_{m,2}$ where the sink is always an element of the set counted by the first index. We use these characterizations to give explicit formulae for the lacking polynomials of these graphs. Log-concavity of the sequence of coefficients of these two lacking polynomials is proven, and we conjecture log-concavity holds for this general class of graphs.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Rogers-Szeg\"{o} Polynomial $q$-Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Rogers-Szeg\"o deformed $q$-differential operators g$_{n}(bD_{q}|u)$ based on $q$-differential operator $D_{q}$. The motivation for introducing the operators g$_{n}(bD_{q})$ is that their limit turns out to be the $q$-exponential operator T$(bD_{q})$ given by Chen. The deformed homogeneous Al-Salam-Carlitz polynomials $\Psi_{m}^{(q^{-n})}(ub,x|uq^{-1})$ can easily be represented by using the operators g$_{n}(bD_{q}|u)$. Identities relating the new general Al-Salam-Carlitz polynomial, defined by Cao et al., the generalized, and homogeneous Al-Salam-Carlitz polynomials $\Phi_{m}^{(q^n)}(b,x|q)$ and basic hypergeometric series are given.</description>

      <title>On the $d$-independence number in 1-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-independence number of a graph $G$ is the largest possible size of an independent set $I$ in $G$ where each vertex of $I$ has degree at least $d$ in $G$. Upper bounds for the $d$-independence number in planar graphs are well-known for $d=3,4,5$, and can in fact be matched with constructions that actually have minimum degree $d$. In this paper, we explore the same questions for 1-planar graphs, i.e., graphs that can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing per edge. We give upper bounds for the $d$-independence number for all $d$. Then we give constructions that match the upper bound, and (for small $d$) also have minimum degree $d$.</description>

      <title>Cartesian products of graphs and their coherent configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent configuration $\mathsf{WL}(X)$ of a graph $X$ is the smallest coherent configuration on the vertices of $X$ that contains the edge set of $X$ as a relation. The aim of the paper is to study $\mathsf{WL}(X)$ when $X$ is a Cartesian product of graphs. The example of a Hamming graph shows that, in general, $\mathsf{WL}(X)$ does not coincide with the tensor product of the coherent configurations of the factors. We prove that if $X$ is ``closed'' with respect to the $6$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, then $\mathsf{WL}(X)$ is the tensor product of the coherent configurations of certain graphs related to the prime decomposition of $X$. This condition is trivially satisfied for almost all graphs. In addition, we prove that the property of a graph ``to be decomposable into a Cartesian product of $k$ connected prime graphs'' for some $k\ge 1$ is recognized by the $m$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm for all $m\ge 6$.</description>

      <title>Corners in Quasirandom Groups via Sparse Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bounds on the density of corner-free sets over quasirandom groups from inverse poly-logarithmic to quasi-polynomial. We make similarly substantial improvements to the best known lower bounds on the communication complexity of a large class of permutation functions in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. Underpinning both results is a general combinatorial theorem that extends the recent work of Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC'24), itself a development of ideas from the breakthrough result of Kelley and Meka on three-term arithmetic progressions (FOCS'23).</description>

Abstract: Cages ($r$-regular graphs of girth $g$ and minimum order) and their variants have been studied for over seventy years. Here we propose a new variant, "weighted cages". We characterize their existence; for cases $g=3,4$ we determine their order; we give Moore-like bounds and present some computational results.</description>

      <title>Coboundary expansion of coset complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coboundary expansion is a high dimensional generalization of the Cheeger constant to simplicial complexes. Originally, this notion was motivated by the fact that it implies topological expansion, but nowadays a significant part of the motivation stems from its deep connection to problems in theoretical computer science such as agreement expansion in the low soundness regime. In this paper, we prove coboundary expansion with non-Abelian coefficients for the coset complex construction of Kaufman and Oppenheim. Our proof uses a novel global argument, as opposed to the local-to-global arguments that are used to prove cosystolic expansion.</description>

Abstract: We compute the total number of spanning trees for the generalized cone of the complete graph $K_n$ and a number of families of some modified bipartite graphs $K_{m,n}$. In particular, we obtain a new method of finding the number of spanning trees of $K_n$ and $K_{m,n}$. Our method relies on the vertex deletion formula for the number of spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Patterns in Multi-dimensional Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework that extends the theory of permutation patterns to higher dimensions and unifies several combinatorial objects studied in the literature. Our approach involves introducing the concept of a "level" for an element in a multi-dimensional permutation, which can be defined in multiple ways. We consider two natural definitions of a level, each establishing connections to other combinatorial sequences found in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). Our framework allows us to offer combinatorial interpretations for various sequences found in the OEIS, many of which previously lacked such interpretations. As a notable example, we introduce an elegant combinatorial interpretation for the Springer numbers: they count weakly increasing 3-dimensional permutations under the definition of levels determined by maximal entries.</description>

      <title>The minimum number of maximal dissociation sets in unicyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of vertices in a graph $G$ is considered a maximal dissociation set if it induces a subgraph with vertex degree at most 1 and it is not contained within any other dissociation sets. In this paper, it is shown that for $n\geq 3$, every unicyclic graph contains a minimum of $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+2$ maximal dissociation sets. We also show the graphs that attain this minimum bound.</description>

      <title>The maximal sum of sizes of cross intersecting families for multisets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$, $t$ and $m$ be positive integers. A $k$-multiset of $[m]$ is a collection of $k$ elements of $[m]$ with repetition and without ordering. We use $\left(\binom {[m]}{k}\right)$ to denote all the $k$-multisets of $[m]$. Two multiset families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ in $\left(\binom {[m]}{k}\right)$ are called cross $t$-intersecting if $|F\cap G|\geq t$ for any $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$. Moreover, if $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{G}$, we call $\mathcal{F}$ a $t$-intersecting family in $\left(\binom {[m]}{k}\right)$. Meagher and Purdy~(2011) presented a multiset variant of Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem for $t$-intersecting family in $\left(\binom {[m]}{k}\right)$ when $t=1$, and F\"uredi, Gerbner and Vizer~(2016) extended this result to general $t\ge 2$ with $m\geq 2k-t$, verified a conjecture proposed by Meagher and Purdy~(2011). In this paper, we determine the maximum sum of cross $t$-intersecting families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ in $\left(\binom {[m]}{k}\right)$ and characterize the extremal families achieving the upper bound. For $t=1$ and $m\geq k+1$, the method involves constructing a bijection between multiset family and set family while preserving the intersecting relation.
  For $t\ge 2$ and $m\ge 2k-t$, we employ a shifting operation, specifically the down-compression, which was initiated by F\"uredi, Gerbner and Vizer~(2016). These results extend the sum-type intersecting theorem for set families originally given by Hilton and Milner (1967).</description>

      <title>Regions of Level $l$ of Exponential Sequence of Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper primary investigates a specific type of deformation of the braid arrangement $\mathcal{B}_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is the set $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ of the following hyperplanes: \[ x_i-x_j=a_1,\ldots,a_m, \quad 1\le i&lt;j\le n, \] where $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_m\}$ consists of distinct real numbers. We denote the exponential generating function by $R_l(A;t):=\sum_{n\ge 0}r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)\frac{t^n}{n!}$, where $r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)$ represents the number of regions of level $l$ in $\mathcal{B}_n^A$. Using the weighted digraph model introduced by Hetyei, we establish a bijection between the regions of level $l$ in $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ and the valid $m$-acyclic weighted digraphs on the vertex set $[n]$ with exactly $l$ strong components. This result refines Hetyei's bijection from the regions of $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ to the valid $m$-acyclic weighted digraphs on $[n]$. Based on the bijection, we further demonstrate that the sequence $\big(r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)\big)_{n\ge 0}$ exhibits a property analogous to that of a polynomial sequence of binomial type, that is, $R_l(A;t)$ satisfies the relation \[ R_l(A;t)=\big(R_1(A;t)\big)^l=R_k(A;t)R_{l-k}(A;t). \] For any non-negative integers $n\ge 2$, $a$ and $b$ with $b-a\ge 2$ and $b-a\ge n-1$, we also show that the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{\mathcal{B}_n^{[-a,b]}}(t)$ has a unique real root at $0$ if $n$ is odd as well as two simple real roots $0$ and $\frac{n(a+b+1)}{2}$ if $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chromatic Numbers from Exact Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Van Hoeve proposed an algorithm for graph coloring based on an integer flow formulation on decision diagrams for stable sets. We prove that the solution to the linear flow relaxation on exact decision diagrams determines the fractional chromatic number of a graph. This settles the question whether the decision diagram formulation or the fractional chromatic number establishes a stronger lower bound. It also establishes that the integrality gap of the linear programming relaxation is O(log n), where n represents the number of vertices in the graph. We also conduct experiments using exact decision diagrams and could determine the chromatic number of r1000.1c from the DIMACS benchmark set. It was previously unknown and is one of the few newly solved DIMACS instances in the last 10 years.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$, a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry. To this end, we propose the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)=\min\{\mathrm{xc}(Q)+\mathrm{xc}(R)\mid P+Q=R\}$. This generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of a neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains open to derive strong lower bounds on virtual extension complexity, we show that powerful results on the ordinary extension complexity can be converted into lower bounds for monotone neural networks, that is, neural networks with only nonnegative weights. Furthermore, we show that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation. We therefore believe that virtual extension complexity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks, just like the ordinary extension complexity. As a first step in this direction, we derive an example showing that extension complexity can go down under Minkowski sum.</description>

      <title>Enumeration modulo 4 of overpartitions wherein only even parts can be overlined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2014, as part of a larger study of overpartitions with restrictions of the overlined parts based on residue classes, Munagi and Sellers defined $d_2(n)$ as the number of overpartitions of weight $n$ wherein only even parts can be overlined. As part of that work, they used a generating function approach to prove a parity characterization for $d_2(n)$. In this note, we give a combinatorial proof of their result and extend it to a modulus 4 characterization; we provide both generating function and combinatorial proofs of this stronger result. The combinatorial arguments incorporate classical involutions of Franklin, Glaisher, and Sylvester, along with a recent involution of van Leeuwen and methods new with this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harary reconstruction conjecture states that any graph with more than four edges can be uniquely reconstructed from its set of maximal edge-deleted subgraphs. In 1977, M\"uller verified the conjecture for graphs with $n$ vertices and $n \log_2(n)$ edges, improving on Lov\'as's bound of $\log(n^2-n)/4$. Here, we show that the reconstruction conjecture holds for graphs which have exactly one cycle and and three non-isomorphic subtrees.</description>

      <title>Leaky forcing and resilience of Cartesian products of $K_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero forcing is a process on a graph $G = (V,E)$ in which a set of initially colored vertices,$B_0(G) \subset V(G)$, can color their neighbors according to the color change rule. The color change rule states that if a vertex $v$ can color a neighbor $u$ if $u$ is the only uncolored neighbor of $v$. If a vertex $v$ colors its neighbor, $u$, $v$ is said to force $u$. Leaky forcing is a recently introduced variant of zero forcing in which some vertices cannot force their neighbors, even if they satisfy the color change rule. This variation has been studied for limited families of graphs with particular structure, such as products of paths and discrete hypercubes. A concept closely related to $\ell$-leaky forcing is $\ell$-resilience. A graph is said to be $\ell$-resilient if its $\ell$-leaky forcing number equals its zero forcing number. In this paper, we prove direct products of $K_n$ with $P_t$ and $K_n$ with $C_t$ is 1-resilient and conjecture the former is not 2-resilient.</description>

      <title>Minkowski ideals and rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \emph{Minkowski rings} are certain rings of simple functions on
  the Euclidean space $W = {\mathbb{R}}^d$
  with multiplicative structure derived from Minkowski addition of convex
  polytopes. When the ring is (finitely) generated by a set ${\cal{P}}$
  of indicator functions of $n$ polytopes then the ring can be presented
  as ${\mathbb{C}}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ when viewed
  as a ${\mathbb{C}}$-algebra, where $I$ is the ideal describing all the relations
  implied by identities among Minkowski sums of elements of ${\cal{P}}$.
  We discuss in detail
  the $1$-dimensional case, the $d$-dimensional box case and the affine
  Coxeter arrangement in ${\mathbb{R}}^2$ where the convex sets are formed
  by closed half-planes with bounding lines making the regular triangular
  grid in ${\mathbb{R}}^2$.
  We also consider, for a given polytope $P$, the Minkowski ring
  $M^\pm_F(P)$ of the collection ${\cal{F}}(P)$
  of the nonempty faces of $P$ and their multiplicative inverses.
  Finally we prove some general properties of identities
  in the Minkowski ring of ${\cal{F}}(P)$; in particular, we show that
  Minkowski rings behave well under Cartesian product, namely that
  $M^\pm_F(P\times Q)
  \cong M^{\pm}_F(P)\otimes M^{\pm}_F(Q)$
  as ${\mathbb{C}}$-algebras where $P$ and $Q$ are polytopes.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Star Motifs: Network Response to Link Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding efficient modifications to improve network functionality is a fundamental problem of scientific and industrial interest. We study the response of network dynamics against link modifications on a weakly connected directed graph consisting of two strongly connected components: an undirected star and an undirected cycle. We assume that there are directed edges starting from the cycle and ending at the star (master-slave formalism). We modify the graph by adding directed edges of arbitrarily large weights starting from the star and ending at the cycle (opposite direction of the cutset). We provide criteria (based on the sizes of the star and cycle, the coupling structure, and the weights of cutset and modification edges) that determine how the modification affects the spectral gap of the Laplacian matrix. We apply our approach to understand the modifications that either enhance or hinder synchronization in networks of chaotic Lorenz systems as well as R\"ossler. Our results show that the hindrance of collective dynamics due to link additions is not atypical as previously anticipated by modification analysis and thus allows for better control of collective properties.</description>

      <title>Linear-Time Algorithms for k-Edge-Connected Components, k-Lean Tree Decompositions, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithms for various problems about decomposing a given undirected graph by edge cuts or vertex separators of size $&lt;k$ into parts that are ``well-connected'' with respect to cuts or separators of size $&lt;k$; here, $m$ is the total number of vertices and edges of the graph. As an application of our results, we obtain for every fixed $k$ a linear-time algorithm for computing the $k$-edge-connected components of a given graph, solving a long-standing open problem. More generally, we obtain a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-Gomory-Hu tree of a given graph, which is a structure representing pairwise minimum cuts of size $&lt;k$.
  Our main technical result, from which the other results follow, is a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-lean tree decomposition of a given graph. This is a tree decomposition with adhesion size $&lt;k$ that captures the existence of separators of size $&lt;k$ between subsets of its bags. A $k$-lean tree decomposition is also an unbreakable tree decomposition with optimal unbreakability parameters for the adhesion size bound $k$.
  As further applications, we obtain $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithms for $k$-vertex connectivity and for element connectivity $k$-Gomory-Hu tree. All of our algorithms are deterministic.
  Our techniques are inspired by the tenth paper of the Graph Minors series of Robertson and Seymour and by Bodlaender's parameterized linear-time algorithm for treewidth.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with logarithmic average degrees. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral study of a temporal rural postman problem: application in inspection of railway track without disturbing train schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rural Postman Problem with Temporal Unavailability (RPP-TU) is a variant of the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) specified for multi-agent planning over directed graphs with temporal constraints. These temporal constraints represent the unavailable time intervals for each arc during which agents cannot traverse the arc. Such arc unavailability scenarios occur in routing and scheduling of the instrumented wagons for inspection of railway tracks without disturbing the train schedules, i.e. the scheduled trains prohibit access to the signal blocks (sections of railway track separated by signals) for some finite interval of time.
  A three-index formulation for the RPP-TU is adopted from the literature. The three-index formulation has binary variables for describing the route information of the agents, and continuous non-negative variables to describe the schedules at pre-defined locations. A relaxation of the three-index formulation for RPP-TRU, referred to as Cascaded Graph Formulation (CGF), is investigated in this work. The CGF has attributes that simplify the polyhedral study of time-dependent arc routing problems like RPP-TRU. A novel branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed to solve the RPP-TU, where branching is performed over the service arcs. A family of facet-defining inequalities, derived from the polyhedral study, is used as cutting planes in the proposed branch-and-cut algorithm to reduce the computation time by up to $48\%$. Finally, an application of this work is showcased using a simulation case study of a railway inspection scheduling problem based on Kurla-Vashi-Thane suburban network in Mumbai, India. An improvement of $93\%$ is observed when compared to a Benders' decomposition based MILP solver from the literature.</description>

      <title>Community detection with the Bethe-Hessian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Hessian matrix, introduced by Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014), is a Hermitian matrix designed for applying spectral clustering algorithms to sparse networks. Rather than employing a non-symmetric and high-dimensional non-backtracking operator, a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix is conjectured to also reach the Kesten-Stigum detection threshold in the sparse stochastic block model (SBM). We provide the first rigorous analysis of the Bethe-Hessian spectral method in the SBM under both the bounded expected degree and the growing degree regimes. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) When the expected degree $d\geq 2$, the number of negative outliers of the Bethe-Hessian matrix can consistently estimate the number of blocks above the Kesten-Stigum threshold, thus confirming a conjecture from Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014) for $d\geq 2$. (ii) For sufficiently large $d$, its eigenvectors can be used to achieve weak recovery. (iii) As $d\to\infty$, we establish the concentration of the locations of its negative outlier eigenvalues, and weak consistency can be achieved via a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental group of a directed graph admits a natural sequence of quotient groups called $r$-fundamental groups, and the $r$-fundamental groups can capture properties of a directed graph that the fundamental group cannot capture. The fundamental group of a directed graph is related to path homology through the Hurewicz theorem. The magnitude-path spectral sequence connects magnitude homology and path homology of a directed graph, and it may be thought of as a sequence of homology of a directed graph, including path homology. In this paper, we study relations of the $r$-fundamental groups and the magnitude-path spectral sequence through the Hurewicz theorem and the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.</description>

      <title>Codes with restricted overlaps: expandability, constructions, and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a $q$-ary block code satisfying the property that no $l$-letters long codeword's prefix occurs as a suffix of any codeword for $l$ inside some interval. We determine a general upper bound on the maximum size of these codes and a tighter bound for codes where overlaps with lengths not exceeding $k$ are prohibited. We then provide constructions for codes with various restrictions on overlap lengths and use them to determine lower bounds on the maximum sizes. In particular, we construct $(1,k)$-overlap-free codes where $k \geq n/2$ and $n$ denotes the block size, expand a known construction of $(k,n-1)$-overlap-free codes, and combine the ideas behind both constructions to obtain $(t_1,t_2)$-overlap-free codes and codes that are simultaneously $(1,k)$- and $(n-k,n-1)$-overlap-free for some $k &lt; n/2$. In the case when overlaps of lengths between 1 and $k$ are prohibited, we complete the characterisation of non-expandable codes started by Cai, Wang, and Feng (2023).</description>

      <title>Growing conditioned BGW trees with log-concave offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that given a log-concave offspring distribution, the corresponding sequence of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have $n\geq 1$ vertices admits a realization as a Markov process $(T_n)_{n\geq1}$ which adds a new ``right-leaning'' leaf at each step. This applies for instance to offspring distributions which are Poisson, binomial, geometric, or any convolution of those. By a negative result of Janson, the log-concavity condition is optimal in the restricted case of offspring distributions supported in $\{0,1,2\}$. We then prove a generalization to the case of an offspring distribution supported on an arithmetic progression, if we assume log-concavity along that progression.
  As an application, we deduce the existence of increasing couplings in an inhomogeneous model of random subtrees of the Ulam--Harris tree.
  These results generalize a construction of Luczak and Winkler which applies to uniformly sampled subtrees with $n$ vertices of the infinite complete $d$-ary trees. Our proofs are elementary and we tried to make them as self-contained as possible.</description>

      <title>Cauchy identities for staircase matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Cauchy identity expresses the product of terms $(1 - x_i y_j)^{-1}$ for $(i,j)$ indexing entries of a rectangular $m\times n$-matrix as a sum over partitions $\lambda$ of products of Schur polynomials: $s_{\lambda}(x)s_{\lambda}(y)$. Algebraically, this identity comes from the decomposition of the symmetric algebra of the space of rectangular matrices, considered as a $\mathfrak{gl}_m$-$\mathfrak{gl}_n$-bi-module. We generalize the Cauchy decomposition by replacing rectangular matrices with arbitrary staircase-shaped matrices equipped with the left and right actions of the Borel upper-triangular subalgebras. For any given staircase shape $\mathsf{Y}$ we describe left and right "standard" filtrations on the symmetric algebra of the space of shape $\mathsf{Y}$ matrices. We show that the subquotients of these filtrations are tensor products of Demazure and van der Kallen modules over the Borel subalgebras. On the level of characters, we derive three distinct expansions for the product $(1 - x_i y_j)^{-1}$ for $(i,j) \in \mathsf{Y}$. The first two expansions are sums of products of key polynomials $\kappa_\lambda(x)$ and Demazure atoms $a_{\mu}(y)$. The third expansion is an alternating sum of products of key polynomials $\kappa_{\lambda}(x)\,\kappa_{\mu}(y)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the distributions of finitely many binary random variables, we study the interaction of restrictions of the supports with conditional independence constraints. We prove a generalization of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem for distributions whose support is a natural distributive lattice: that is, any distribution which has natural lattice support and satisfies the pairwise Markov statements of a graph must factor according to the graph. We also show a connection to the Hibi ideals of lattices.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, Jianqiang Zhao has established a curious congruence $$
  \sum_{i+j+k=p \atop i,j,k &gt; 0} \frac{1}{ijk} \equiv -2B_{p-3}\pmod p , $$ where $B_{n}$ denotes the $n-$th Bernoulli numbers. In this paper, we will generalize this problem by using congruent theory and combinatorial methods, and we get some curious congruences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The game of Moksha-Patam, often known as `Chutes and Ladders', is a widely played indoor game worldwide. While studies have been conducted regarding the nature of an individual board, the possibilities that open up when we change the positions of the chutes and the ladders on a board are mostly unventured. In this article, we classify and study the different possible types of Moksha-Patam Boards, introduce a naming convention for them and establish a count for the boards that can be constructed adhering to some basic assumptions of the game.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a problem in computational complexity, we consider the behavior of rank functions for tensors and polynomial maps under random coordinate restrictions. We show that, for a broad class of rank functions called natural rank functions, random coordinate restriction to a dense set will typically reduce the rank by at most a constant factor.</description>

Abstract: Using recent developments on the theory of locally decodable codes, we prove that the critical size for Szemer\'edi's theorem with random differences is bounded from above by $N^{1-\frac{2}{k} + o(1)}$ for length-$k$ progressions. This gives polynomial improvements over the previous best bounds for all odd $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14312v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a matroid and a group of its matroid automorphisms, we study the induced group action on the Chow ring of the matroid. This turns out to always be a permutation action. Work of Adiprasito, Huh and Katz showed that the Chow ring satisfies Poincar\'e duality and the Hard Lefschetz theorem. We lift these to statements about this permutation action, and suggest further conjectures in this vein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andrews and Keith recently produced a general Schmidt type partition theorem using a novel interpretation of Stockhofe's bijection, which they used to find new $q$-series identities. This includes an identity for a trivariate 2-colored partition generating function. In this paper, their Schmidt type theorem is further generalized akin to how Franklin classically extended Glaisher's theorem. As a consequence, we obtain a companion to Andrews and Keith's 2-colored identity for overpartitions. These identities appear to be special cases of a much more general result.</description>

      <title>Frames for signal processing on Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral decomposition of graph adjacency matrices is an essential ingredient in the design of graph signal processing (GSP) techniques. When the adjacency matrix has multi-dimensional eigenspaces, it is desirable to base GSP constructions on a particular eigenbasis that better reflects the graph's symmetries. In this paper, we provide an explicit and detailed representation-theoretic account for the spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a weighted Cayley graph. Our method applies to all weighted Cayley graphs, regardless of whether they are quasi-Abelian, and offers detailed descriptions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors derived from the coefficient functions of the representations of the underlying group. Next, we turn our attention to constructing frames on Cayley graphs. Frames are overcomplete spanning sets that ensure stable and potentially redundant systems for signal reconstruction. We use our proposed eigenbases to build frames that are suitable for developing signal processing on Cayley graphs. These are the Frobenius--Schur frames and Cayley frames, for which we provide a characterization and a practical recipe for their construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology ring of the Bott--Samelson variety. We compute an explicit presentation of this ring via Soergel's result, which implies that it is a purely combinatorial invariant. We use the presentation to introduce the Bott--Samelson ring associated with a word in arbitrary Coxeter system by generators and relations. In general, it is a split quadratic complete intersection algebra with a triangular pattern of relations. By a result of Tate, it follows that it is a Koszul algebra and we provide a quadratic (reduced) Gr{\"o}bner basis. Furthermore, we prove that it satisfies the whole K\"ahler package, including the Poincar\'e duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge--Riemann bilinear relations.</description>

      <title>Random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries and the Cohen--Lenstra distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of the cokernels of random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries. Let $X_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ in which some entries are fixed to be zero and the other entries are i.i.d. copies of a random variable $\xi \in \mathbb{Z}_p$. We consider the minimal number of random entries of $X_n$ required for the cokernel of $X_n$ to converge to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution. When $\xi$ is given by the Haar measure, we prove a lower bound of the number of random entries and prove its converse-type result using random regular bipartite multigraphs. When $\xi$ is a general random variable, we determine the minimal number of random entries. Let $M_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $k$-step stairs of zeros and the other entries given by independent random $\epsilon$-balanced variables valued in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We prove that the cokernel of $M_n$ converges to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution under a mild assumption. This extends Wood's universality theorem on random $p$-adic matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an operation on skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ called switching, and also define a class of skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ referred to as modular Eulerian matrices. We then show that these are closely related to the graded module categories over skew polynomial algebras at $\ell$-th roots of unity. As an application, we study the point simplicial complexes of skew polynomial algebras at cube roots of unity.</description>

Abstract: We treat three recurrences involving square roots, the first of which arises from an infinite simple radical expansion for the Golden mean, whose precise convergence rate was made famous by Richard Bruce Paris in 1987. A never-before-seen proof of an important formula is given. The other recurrences are non-exponential yet equally interesting. Asymptotic series developed for each of these two examples feature a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>

      <title>Improved Explicit Near-Optimal Codes in the High-Noise Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study uniquely decodable codes and list decodable codes in the high-noise regime, specifically codes that are uniquely decodable from $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ fraction of errors and list decodable from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors. We present several improved explicit constructions that achieve near-optimal rates, as well as efficient or even linear-time decoding algorithms. Our contributions are as follows.
  1. Explicit Near-Optimal Linear Time Uniquely Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of correcting $e$ errors and $s$ erasures whenever $2e + s &lt; (1 - \varepsilon)n$ in linear-time.
  2. Explicit Near-Optimal List Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with a list size $L = \exp\exp\exp(\log^{\ast}n)$ in polynomial time.
  3. List Decodable Code with Near-Optimal List Size: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with an optimal list size of $O(1/\varepsilon)$, albeit with a suboptimal rate of $O(\varepsilon^2)$, capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors in polynomial time. Furthermore, we introduce a new combinatorial object called multi-set disperser, and use it to give a family of list decodable codes with near-optimal rate $\frac{\varepsilon}{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}$ and list size $\frac{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}$, that can be constructed in probabilistic polynomial time and decoded in deterministic polynomial time.
  We also introduce new decoding algorithms that may prove valuable for other graph-based codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property in (i) sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs, shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.</description>
