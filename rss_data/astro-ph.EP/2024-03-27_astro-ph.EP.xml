      <title>3D Gap Opening in Non-Ideal MHD Protoplanetary Disks: Asymmetric Accretion, Meridional Vortices, and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-angular resolution ALMA observations have revealed rich information about protoplanetary disks, including ubiquitous substructures and three-dimensional gas kinematics at different emission layers. One interpretation of these observations is embedded planets. Previous 3-D planet-disk interaction studies are either based on viscous simulations, or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations with simple prescribed magnetic diffusivities. This study investigates the dynamics of gap formation in 3-D non-ideal MHD disks using non-ideal MHD coefficients from the look-up table that is self-consistently calculated based on the thermo-chemical code. We find a concentration of the poloidal magnetic flux in the planet-opened gap (in agreement with previous work) and enhanced field-matter coupling due to gas depletion, which together enable efficient magnetic braking of the gap material, driving a fast accretion layer significantly displaced from the disk midplane. The fast accretion helps deplete the gap further and is expected to negatively impact the growth of planetary embryos. It also affects the corotation torque by shrinking the region of horseshoe orbits on the trailing side of the planet. Together with the magnetically driven disk wind, the fast accretion layer generates a large, persistent meridional vortex in the gap, which breaks the mirror symmetry of gas kinematics between the top and bottom disk surfaces. Finally, by studying the kinematics at the emission surfaces, we discuss the implications of planets in realistic non-ideal MHD disks on kinematics observations.</description>

      <title>On the properties of free floating planets originating in circumbinary planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-floating planets are a new class of planets recently discovered. These planets don't orbit within stellar systems, instead living a nomadic life within the galaxy. How such objects formed remains elusive. Numerous works have explored mechanisms to form such objects, but have not yet provided predictions on their distributions that could differentiate between formation mechanisms. In this work we form these objects within circumbinary systems, where these planets are readily formed and ejected through interactions with the central binary stars. We find significant differences between planets ejected through planet-planet interactions and those by the binary stars. The main differences that arise are in the distributions of excess velocity, where binary stars eject planets with faster velocities. These differences should be observable amongst known free-floating planets in nearby star-forming regions. We predict that targeted observations of directly imaged free-floating planets in these regions should be able to determine their preferred formation pathway, either by planet formation in single or multiple stellar systems, or through processes akin to star formation. Additionally the mass distributions of free-floating planets can yield important insights into the underlying planet populations. We find that for planets more massive than 20 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, their frequencies are similar to those planets remaining bound and orbiting near the central binaries. This similarity allows for effective and informative comparisons between mass distributions from microlensing surveys, to those of transit and radial velocities. Ultimately, by observing the velocity dispersion and mass distribution of free-floating planets, it will be possible to effectively compare with predictions from planet formation models, and to further understand the formation and evolution of these exotic worlds.</description>

      <title>The Distribution of Highly Red-sloped Asteroids in the Middle and Outer Main Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red (S &gt; 10%/0.1 micron) spectral slopes are common among Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the outer solar system. Interior to and co-orbital with Jupiter, the red (S approx. = 10%/0.1 micron) slopes of D-type main-belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids are thought to reflect their hypothesized shared origin with TNOs beyond the orbit of Jupiter. In order to quantify the abundance of red-sloped asteroids within the main belt, we conducted a survey using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Lowell Discovery Telescope. We followed up on 32 candidate red objects identified via spectrophotometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Moving Object Catalog to confirm their steep spectral slopes and determine their taxonomic classifications. We find that our criteria for identifying candidate red objects from the Moving Object Catalog result in an approx. 50% confirmation rate for steeply red-sloped asteroids. We also compare our observations of main-belt asteroids to existing literature spectra of the Jupiter Trojans and steeply red-sloped main-belt asteroids. We show that some red-sloped asteroids have linearly increasing reflectance with increasing wavelength, while other red-sloped asteroids show a flattening in slope at longer near-infrared wavelengths, indicating a diversity among the population of spectrally red main-belt asteroids suggestive of a variety of origins among the population of steep-sloped asteroids.</description>

      <title>Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 1: identifying the rate-limiting physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple nations are planning activity on the Moon's surface, and to deconflict lunar operations we must understand the sandblasting damage from rocket exhaust blowing soil. Prior research disagreed over the scaling of the erosion rate, which determines the magnitude of the damage. Reduced gravity experiments and two other lines of evidence now indicate that the erosion rate scales with the kinetic energy flux at the bottom of the laminar sublayer of the gas. Because the rocket exhaust is so fast, eroded particles lifted higher in the boundary layer do not impact the surface for kilometers (if at all; some leave the Moon entirely), so there is no saltation in the vicinity of the gas. As a result, there is little transport of gas kinetic energy from higher in the boundary layer down to the surface, so the emission of soil into the gas is a surprisingly low energy process. In low lunar gravity, a dominant source of resistance to this small energy flux turns out to be the cohesive energy density of the lunar soil, which arises primarily from particles in the 0.3 to 3 micron size range. These particles constitute only a tiny fraction of the mass of lunar soil and have been largely ignored in most studies, so they are poorly characterized.</description>

      <title>Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 2: benchmarking and predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the companion paper ("Erosion rate of lunar soil under a landing rocket, part 1: identifying the rate-limiting physics", this issue) an equation was developed for the rate that lunar soil erodes under the exhaust of a landing rocket. That equation has only one parameter that is not calibrated from first principles, so here it is calibrated by the blowing soil's optical density curve during an Apollo landing. An excellent fit is obtained, helping validate the equation. However, when extrapolating the erosion rate all the way to touchdown on the lunar surface, a soil model is needed to handle the increased resistance to erosion as the deeper, more compacted soil is exposed. Relying on models derived from Apollo measurements and from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner thermal inertia measurements, only one additional soil parameter is unknown: the scale of increasing cohesive energy with soil compaction. Treating this as an additional fitting parameter results in some degeneracy in the solutions, but the depth of erosion scour in the post-landing imagery provides an additional constraint on the solution. The results show that about 4 to 10 times more soil was blown in each Apollo landing than previously believed, so the potential for sandblasting damage is worse than prior estimates. This also shows that, with further development, instruments to measure the soil erosion during lunar landings can constrain the soil column's density profile complementary to the thermal inertia measurements, providing insight into the landing site's geology.</description>

      <title>Achieving Quantum Limits of Exoplanet Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is fundamentally impeded by the high dynamic range between the star and the planet. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet signatures by optically rejecting light from the host star while leaving light from the exoplanet mostly unaltered. However it is unclear whether coronagraphs constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant exoplanet discovery. In this work, we report the quantum information limits of exoplanet detection and localization specified by the Quantum Chernoff Exponent (QCE) and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) respectively. In view of these quantum limits, we assess and compare several high-performance coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve total rejection of an on-axis point source. We find that systems which exclusively eliminate the fundamental mode of the telescope without attenuating higher-order orthogonal modes are quantum-optimal in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Importantly, the QFIM is shown to persist well below the diffraction-limit of the telescope, suggesting that quantum-optimal coronagraphs may further expand the domain of accessible exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Analytical computation of bifurcation of orbits near collinear libration point in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unified analytical solution is presented for constructing the phase space near collinear libration points in the Circular Restricted Three-body Problem (CRTBP), encompassing Lissajous orbits and quasihalo orbits, their invariant manifolds, as well as transit and non-transit orbits. Traditional methods could only derive separate analytical solutions for the invariant manifolds of Lissajous orbits and halo orbits, falling short for the invariant manifolds of quasihalo orbits. By introducing a coupling coefficient {\eta} and a bifurcation equation, a unified series solution for these orbits is systematically developed using a coupling-induced bifurcation mechanism and Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Analyzing the third-order bifurcation equation reveals bifurcation conditions for halo orbits, quasihalo orbits, and their invariant manifolds. Furthermore, new families of periodic orbits similar to halo orbits are discovered, and non-periodic/quasi-periodic orbits, such as transit orbits and non-transit orbits, are found to undergo bifurcations. When {\eta} = 0, the series solution describes Lissajous orbits and their invariant manifolds, transit, and non-transit orbits. As {\eta} varies from zero to non-zero values, the solution seamlessly transitions to describe quasihalo orbits and their invariant manifolds, as well as newly bifurcated transit and non-transit orbits. This unified analytical framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex phase space structures near collinear libration points in the CRTBP.</description>

      <title>Principles Of Heliophysics: a textbook on the universal processes behind planetary habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heliophysics is the system science of the physical connections between the Sun and the solar system. As the physics of the local cosmos, it embraces space weather and planetary habitability. The wider view of comparative heliophysics forms a template for conditions in exoplanetary systems and provides a view over time of the aging Sun and its magnetic activity, of the heliosphere in different settings of the interstellar medium and subject to stellar impacts, of the space physics over evolving planetary dynamos, and of the long-term influence on planetary atmospheres by stellar radiation and wind.
  Based on a series of NASA-funded summer schools for early-career researchers, this textbook is intended for students in physical sciences in later years of their university training and for beginning graduate students in fields of solar, stellar, (exo-)planetary, and planetary-system sciences. The book emphasizes universal processes from a perspective that draws attention to what provides Earth (and similar (exo-)planets) with a relatively stable setting in which life as we know it could thrive. The text includes 200 "Activities" in the form of exercises, explorations, literature readings, "what if" challenges, and group discussion topics; many of the Activities provide additional information complementing the main text. Solutions and discussions are included in an Appendix for a selection of the exercises.</description>

      <title>A simple method to measure numax for asteroseismology: application to 16,000 oscillating Kepler red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of numax (the frequency of maximum oscillation power) for asteroseismology has been demonstrated widely in the previous decade, especially for red giants. With the large amount of photometric data from CoRoT, Kepler and TESS, several automated algorithms to retrieve numax values have been introduced. Most of these algorithms correct the granulation background in the power spectrum by fitting a model and subtracting it before measuring numax. We have developed a method that does not require fitting to the granulation background. Instead, we simply divide the power spectrum by a function of the form nu^-2, to remove the slope due to granulation background, and then smooth to measure numax. This method is fast, simple and avoids degeneracies associated with fitting. The method is able to measure oscillations in 99.9% of previously-studied Kepler red giants, with a systematic offset of 1.5 % in numax values that that we are able to calibrate. On comparing the seismic radii from this work with Gaia, we see similar trends to those observed in previous studies. Additionally, our values of width of the power envelope can clearly identify the dipole mode suppressed stars as a distinct population, hence as a way to detect them. We also applied our method to stars with low (0.19--18.35 muHz) and found it works well to correctly identify the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet and Chromospheric activity and Habitability of M stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M-type stars are crucial for stellar activity studies since they cover two types of magnetic dynamos and particularly intriguing for habitability studies due to their abundance and long lifespans during the main-sequence stage. In this paper, we used the LAMOST DR9 catalog and the GALEX UV archive data to investigate the chromospheric and UV activities of M-type stars. All the chromospheric and UV activity indices clearly show the saturated and unsaturated regimes and the well-known activity-rotation relation, consistent with previous studies. Both the FUV and NUV activity indices exhibit a single-peaked distribution, while the {\rm H$\alpha$} and \rm {Ca \scriptsize{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}} \normalsize H$\&amp;$K} indices show a distinct double-peaked distribution. The gap between these peaks suggests a rapid transition from a saturated population to an unsaturated one. The smoothly varying distributions of different subtypes suggest a rotation-dependent dynamo for both early-type (partly convective) to late-type (fully convective) M stars. We identified a group of stars with high UV activity above the saturation regime (log$R^{\prime}_{\rm NUV} &gt; -2.5$) but low chromospheric activity, and the underlying reason is unknown. By calculating the continuously habitable zone and the UV habitable zone for each star, we found about 70\% stars in the total sample and 40\% stars within 100 pc are located in the overlapping region of these two habitable zones, indicating a number of M stars are potentially habitable. Finally, we examined the possibility of UV activity studies of M stars using the China Space Station Telescope.</description>
