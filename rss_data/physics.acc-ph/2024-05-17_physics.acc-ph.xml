      <title>Comparison of WarpX and GUINEA-PIG for electron positron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the Snowmass'21 planning exercise, the Advanced Accelerator Concepts community proposed developing multi-TeV linear colliders and considered beam-beam effects for these machines. Such colliders operate under a high disruption regime with an enormous number of electron-positron pairs produced from QED effects. Thus, it requires a self-consistent treatment of the fields produced by the pairs, which is not implemented in state-of-the-art beam-beam codes such as GUINEA-PIG. WarpX is a parallel, open-source, and portable particle-in-cell code with an active developer community that models QED processes with photon and pair generation in relativistic laser-beam interactions. However, its application to beam-beam collisions has yet to be fully explored. In this work, we benchmark the luminosity spectra, photon spectra, and coherent production process from WarpX against GUINEA-PIG in the ILC and ultra-tight collision scenarios. Our performance comparison demonstrates a significant speed-up advantage of WarpX, ensuring a more robust and efficient modeling of electron-positron collisions at multi-TeV energies.</description>

      <title>Prototype Design of a Digital Low-level RF System for S-band Deflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S-band deflectors are generally operated on pulsed mode for beam diagnosis. We plan to deploy 5 S-band (2997 MHz) deflectors to accurately measure the longitudinal time distribution of ultra-short electron beam pulses in Shenzhen Superconducting Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (S3FEL). A microwave system of one deflector consists of a low-level RF system (LLRF), a solid-state amplifier, waveguide couplers, and a klystron, operated in pulse mode with a maximum repetition frequency of 50 Hz. Its microwave amplitude and phase stability must be better than 0.06%/0.08{\deg} (RMS). This article will introduce the prototype design of the hardware, firmware, and software of the digital LLRF system. We use homemade Local Oscillators (LOs) and commercial cards based on the MicroTCA standard in hardware design. The firmware design will use a Non-IQ demodulation and a pulse feedforward algorithm to suppress noise from high voltage of klystron. The software design is based on the EPICS control system architecture, achieving slow control and interface display functions. This report will also show some preliminary test results.</description>

      <title>Accelerator beam phase space tomography using machine learning to account for variations in beamline components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a technique for reconstruction of the four-dimensional transverse phase space of a beam in an accelerator beamline, taking into account the presence of unknown errors on the strengths of magnets used in the data collection. Use of machine learning allows rapid reconstruction of the phase-space distribution while at the same time providing estimates of the magnet errors. The technique is demonstrated using experimental data from CLARA, an accelerator test facility at Daresbury Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Impact of medium temperature heat treatment on flux trapping sensitivity in SRF cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of mid-T heat treatment on flux trapping sensitivity was measured on several 1.3 GHz single cell cavities subjected to vacuum annealing at temperature of 150 - 400 $^\circ$C for a duration of 3 hours. The cavity was cooldown with residual magnetic field $\sim$0 and $\sim$20 mG in the Dewar with cooldown condition of full flux trapping. The quality factor as a function of accelerating gradient was measured. The results show the correlation between the treatment temperature, quality factor, and sensitivity to flux trapping. Sensitivity increases with increasing heat treatment temperatures within the range of (200 - 325 $^\circ$C/3h). Moreover, variations in the effective penetration depth of the magnetic field and the density of quasi-particles can occur, influencing alterations in the cavity's electromagnetic response and resonance frequency.</description>

      <title>Efficient 6-dimensional phase space reconstruction from experimental measurements using generative machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation accelerator concepts which hinge on the precise shaping of beam distributions, demand equally precise diagnostic methods capable of reconstructing beam distributions within 6-dimensional position-momentum spaces. However, the characterization of intricate features within 6-dimensional beam distributions using conventional diagnostic techniques necessitates hundreds of measurements, using many hours of valuable beam time. Novel phase space reconstruction techniques are needed to substantially reduce the number of measurements required to reconstruct detailed, high-dimensional beam features in order to resolve complex beam phenomena, and as feedback in precision beam shaping applications. In this study, we present a novel approach to reconstructing detailed 6-dimensional phase space distributions from experimental measurements using generative machine learning and differentiable beam dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that for a collection of synthetic beam distribution test cases that this approach can be used to resolve 6-dimensional phase space distributions using basic beam manipulations and as few as 20 2-dimensional measurements of the beam profile, without the need for prior data collection or model training. We also demonstrate an application of the reconstruction method in an experimental setting at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator, where it is able to reconstruct the beam distribution and accurately predict previously unseen measurements 75x faster than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Field, frequency and temperature dependence of the surface resistance of nitrogen diffused niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the RF performance of several single-cell superconducting radio-frequency cavities subjected to low temperature heat treatment in nitrogen environment. The cavities were treated at temperature 120 - 165 $^{\circ}$C for an extended period of time (24 - 48 hours) either in high vacuum or in a low partial pressure of ultra-pure nitrogen. The improvement in $Q_0$ with a Q-rise was observed when nitrogen gas was injected at $\sim$300 $^{\circ} $C during the cavity cooldown from 800 $^{\circ}$C and held at 165 $^{\circ}$C, without any degradation in accelerating gradient over the baseline performance. The treatment was applied to several elliptical cavities with frequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved quality factor as a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise feature is similar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher temperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing. The surface modification was confirmed by the change in electronic mean free path and tuned with the temperature and duration of heat treatment. The decrease of the temperature-dependent surface resistance with increasing RF field, resulting in a Q-rise, becomes stronger with increasing frequency and decreasing temperature. The data suggest a crossover frequency of $\sim 0.95$~GHz above which the Q-rise phenomenon occurs at 2~K. Some of these results can be explained qualitatively with an existing model of intrinsic field-dependence of the surface resistance with both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions. The change in the Q-slope below 0.95 GHz may result from masking contribution of trapped magnetic flux to the residual surface resistance.</description>
