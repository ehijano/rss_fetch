      <title>High-energy spectra of LTT 1445A and GJ 486 reveal flares and activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-energy radiative output, from the X-ray to the ultraviolet, of exoplanet host stars drives photochemical reactions and mass loss in the upper regions of planetary atmospheres. In order to place constraints on the atmospheric properties of the three closest terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs, we observe the high-energy spectra of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486 in the X-ray with XMM-Newton and Chandra and in the ultraviolet with HST/COS and STIS. We combine these observations with estimates of extreme ultraviolet flux, reconstructions of the Ly-a lines, and stellar models at optical and infrared wavelengths to produce panchromatic spectra from 1A--20um for each star. While LTT1445Ab, LTT1445Ac, and GJ486b do not possess primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, we calculate that they are able to retain pure CO2 atmospheres if starting with 10, 15, and 50% of Earth's total CO2 budget, respectively, in the presence of their host stars' stellar wind. We use age-activity relationships to place lower limits of 2.2 and 6.6 Gyr on the ages of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486. Despite both LTT1445A and GJ486 appearing inactive at optical wavelengths, we detect flares at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths for both stars. In particular, GJ486 exhibits two flares with absolute energies of 10^29.5 and 10^30.1 erg (equivalent durations of 4357+/-96 and 19724+/-169 s) occurring three hours apart, captured with HST/COS G130M. Based on the timing of the observations, we suggest that these high-energy flares are related and indicative of heightened flaring activity that lasts for a period of days, but our interpretations are limited by sparse time-sampling. Consistent high-energy monitoring is needed to determine the duration and extent of high-energy activity on individual M dwarfs, as well as the population as a whole.</description>

      <title>Formation of planetary atmospheres: Analytical estimation of vapor production via planetary impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate impact vaporization for planetary atmosphere formation, we have studied the thermodynamic state generated by the shock wave due to a high-velocity impact, called the shock field. We have carried out iSALE simulations for high-velocity vertical impacts using ANEOS for an equation-of-state (EoS) model. To understand the shock fields obtained from simulations, we have investigated the contribution of the thermal and cold terms in the EoS model on the Hugoniot curves. Although the thermal and cold terms are important for the pressure, the internal energy is mainly determined by the thermal term. We thus assume a simple EoS determined by the thermal term and then analytically derive the shock internal-energy field, which reproduces the results of simulations well. Using the analytical solution of internal energy and the Hugoniot curve, we have derived the shock pressure field analytically as well. The analytical solutions for internal energy and pressure are valid even for impact velocities as low as the sound speed. The solution is good for the vertical direction or within the angles of about 60 degrees. We have applied the solution to impact vaporization for the formation of planetary atmospheres. This gives good estimation of reformation of the planetary atmospheres of Earth sized planet.</description>

      <title>Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) crossing the Jupiter orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of intensive time-resolved imaging photometry and synoptic deep imaging of the comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) performed in February 2013. The data were obtained at the Wise Observatory in Israel (WO), at the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in India, and at the Polaris Observatory Association in California, USA. During this period, the comet's heliocentric distance changed from 4.9 to 4.6 AU, just within the orbit of Jupiter. We analyze these early images in an attempt to determine the nuclear rotation period, assuming that at these relatively large heliocentric distances it would be possible to detect the photometric modulation of a rotating nucleus against an underdeveloped coma. Since this is not evident in our February 2013 data, with more than 400 independent photometric measurements analyzed, we can only set upper limits of 0.05 mag for periodic brightness modulations. We discuss (and discount) a possible brightening event (minor outburst) that occurred on $15-16$ February 2013.
  We also present deep synoptic images of the comet, obtained by combining our exposures for each night, and analyze them. We find that during the period of our observations the comet exhibited a $\sim$$30^{\prime\prime}\simeq 60000$-km tail with no substructures visible and that this appearance did not change throughout our campaign.
  The comet, as indicated by a single spectroscopic measurement obtained during this observation period, showed a dust coma reflecting the solar light. Our observations indicate that during February 2013, comet ISON was relatively quiet, with the dust coma presumably hiding any light modulation by a spinning nucleus.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Water Vapor in the Atmosphere of a Metal-Rich Hot Saturn with High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy presents one of the most successful approaches for investigating the atmospheres of exoplanets. We analyzed the near-infrared high-resolution transmission spectrum of a hot Saturn, HD 149026 b, taken using CARMENES spectrograph ($\mathcal{R}\sim80,400$). We found evidence of H$_2$O at an S/N of $\sim$4.8. We also performed grid search using a Bayesian framework and constrained the orbital velocity $K_\mathrm{p}$ and rest velocity $V_{\mathrm{rest}}$ to $158.17^{+8.31}_{-7.90}$ $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and $2.57^{+0.54}_{-0.57}$ $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. Whilst the retrieved $K_\mathrm{p}$ value is consistent with theoretical prediction, the retrieved $V_{\mathrm{rest}}$ value is highly red-shifted ($&gt;$3-$\sigma$). This might be an indication of either anomalous atmospheric dynamics at play or an orbit with non-zero eccentricity. Additionally, we searched for HCN but no successful detection has been made possibly due to the relatively low S/N dataset. The detection of H$_2$O and subsequent abundance retrieval, coupled with analysis of other species such as CO at the $K$-band, for example, might help us to get some information about the atmospheric C/O ratio and metallicity, which in turn could give us some insight into the planet formation scenario.</description>

      <title>How Land-Mass Distribution Influences the Atmospheric Dynamics of Tidally Locked Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretation of the ongoing efforts to simulate the atmospheres of potentially-habitable terrestrial exoplanets requires that we understand the underlying dynamics and chemistry of such objects to a much greater degree than 1D or even simple 3D models enable. Here, for the tidally-locked habitable-zone planet TRAPPIST-1e, we explore one effect which can shape the dynamics and chemistry of terrestrial planets: the inclusion of an Earth-like land-ocean distribution with orography. To do this we use the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run a pair of TRAPPIST-1e models with N$_2$-O$_2$ atmospheres and with the sub-stellar point fixed over either land or ocean. The presence of orography shapes atmospheric transport, and in the case of Earth-like orography, breaks the symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres which was previously found in slab ocean models. For example, peak zonal jet speeds in the southern hemisphere are $50\rightarrow100\%$ faster than similar jets in the northern hemisphere. This also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material towards the south-pole. As a result we also find significant changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface. Future studies which investigate the effects of land-mass distribution on the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres should pay close attention to both the day-side land-fraction as well as the orography of the land. Simply modelling a flat land-mass will not give a complete picture of its dynamical impact.</description>

      <title>Using A One-Class SVM To Optimize Transit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning algorithms become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations and researchers are using these technologies to automate the process of exoplanet detection. These mainly utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having approximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times faster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same datasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run smoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable resources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection tasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards characterising rocky worlds: Trends in chemical make-ups of M dwarfs versus GK dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental abundances of Sun-like stars are crucial for understanding the detailed properties of their planets. However, measuring elemental abundances in M stars is challenging due to their faintness and pervasive molecular features in optical spectra. To address this, elemental abundances of Sun-like stars have been proposed to constrain those of M stars by scaling [X/H] with measured [Fe/H]. This study tests the robustness of this practice using M- and GK-dwarf stellar abundances and rigorous statistical methods. We compile elemental abundances for 43 M dwarfs for 10 major rock-forming elements (Fe, C, O, Mg, Si, Al, Ca, Na, Ni, and Ti) from high-resolution near-infrared stellar surveys. We perform bootstrap-based linear regressions on the M dwarfs to determine the trends of [X/H] vs. [Fe/H] and compare them with GK dwarfs. A 2-sample, multivariate Mahalanobis Distance test is applied to assess the significance of differences in [X/H]--[Fe/H] trends for individual elemental pairs between M and GK dwarfs. The null hypothesis of no significant difference in chemical trends between M and GK dwarfs is strongly rejected for all elements except Si, for which rejection is marginal, and Na and Ni, for which results are inconclusive. This suggests that assuming no difference may lead to biased results and inaccurate constraints on rocky planets around M dwarfs. Therefore, it is crucial for both the stellar and exoplanet communities to recognise these differences. To better understand these differences, we advocate for dedicated modelling techniques for M dwarf atmospheres and more homogeneous abundance analyses. Our statistically constrained trends of [X/H]--[Fe/H] for M dwarfs offer a new constraint on estimating M-dwarf elemental abundances given measured [Fe/H], aiding in characterising the properties of M dwarf-hosted rocky worlds.</description>

      <title>AtLAST Science Overview Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>

      <title>A formation pathway for terrestrial planets with moderate water content involving atmospheric-volatile recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Of the many recently discovered terrestrial exoplanets, some are expected to harbor moderate water mass fractions of a few percent. The formation pathways that can produce planets with these water mass fractions are not fully understood. Here, we use the code chemcomp, which consists of a semi-analytical 1D protoplanetary disk model harboring a migrating and accreting planet, to model the growth and composition of planets with moderate water mass fractions by pebble accretion in a protoplanetary disk around a TRAPPIST-1 analog star. This star is accompanied by seven terrestrial planets, of which the outer four planets likely contain water mass fractions of between 1\% and 10\%. We adopt a published model that considers the evaporation of pebbles in the planetary envelope, from where recycling flows can transport the volatile vapor back into the disk. We find that with this model, the planetary water content depends on the influx rate of pebbles onto the planet. A decreasing pebble influx with time reduces the envelope temperature and consequently allows the formation of planets with moderate water mass fractions as inferred for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets for a number of different simulation configurations. This is further evidence that the recycling of vapor is an important component of planet formation needed to explain the vast and diverse population of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Density deficit of the Earth's core revealed by a multi-megabar primary pressure scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate pressure scale is a fundamental requirement to understand planetary interiors. Here, we establish a primary pressure scale extending to the multi-megabar pressures of the Earth's core, by combined measurement of the acoustic velocities and the density from a rhenium sample in a diamond anvil cell using inelastic x-ray scattering and x-ray diffraction. Our scale agrees well with previous primary scales and shock Hugoniots in each experimental pressure range, and reveals that previous scales have overestimated laboratory pressures by at least 20% at 230 gigapascals. It suggests that the light element content in the Earth's inner core (the density deficit relative to iron) is likely to be double what was previously estimated, or the Earth's inner core temperature is much higher than expected, or some combination thereof.</description>
