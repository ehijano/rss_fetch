      <title>Pseudo-Gorenstein edge rings and a new family of almost Gorenstein edge rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study edge rings and their $h$-polynomials. We investigate when edge rings are pseudo-Gorenstein, which means that the leading coefficients of the $h$-polynomials of edge rings are equal to $1$. Moreover, we compute the $h$-polynomials of a special family of edge rings and show that some of them are almost Gorenstein.</description>

      <title>Using matrix sparsification to solve tropical linear vector equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear vector equation in two unknown vectors is examined in the framework of tropical algebra dealing with the theory and applications of semirings and semifields with idempotent addition. We consider a two-sided equation where each side is a tropical product of a given matrix by one of the unknown vectors. We use a matrix sparsification technique to reduce the equation to a set of vector inequalities that involve row-monomial matrices obtained from the given matrices. An existence condition of solutions for the inequalities is established, and a direct representation of the solutions is derived in a compact vector form. To illustrate the proposed approach and to compare the obtained result with that of an existing solution procedure, we apply our solution technique to handle two-sided equations known in the literature. Finally, a computational scheme based on the approach to derive all solutions of the two-sided equation is discussed.</description>

      <title>The v-numbers and linear presentations of ideals of covers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $J=I_c(G)$ be its ideal of covers. The aims of this work are to study the {\rm v}-number ${\rm v}(J)$ of $J$ and to study when $J$ is linearly presented using combinatorics and commutative algebra. We classify when ${\rm v}(J)$ attains its minimum and maximum possible values in terms of the vertex covers of the graph that satisfy the exchange property. If the cover ideal of a graph has a linear presentation, we express its v-number in terms of the covering number of the graph. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph $\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ to be connected. Then, for unmixed K\"onig graphs, we classify when $J$ is linearly presented using graph theory, and show some results on Cohen--Macaulay K\"onig graphs. If $G$ is unmixed, it is shown that the columns of the linear syzygy matrix of $J$ are linearly independent if and only if $\mathcal{G}_J$ has no strong $3$-cycles. One of our main theorems shows that if $G$ is unmixed and has no induced 4-cycles, then $J$ is linearly presented. For unmixed graphs without $3$- and $5$-cycles, we classify combinatorially when $J$ is linearly presented.</description>
