      <title>Interior--Boundary Assortativity Profiles on Networks and Applications to SIS Epidemic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce interior-boundary assortativity profiles as a structural refinement of Newman's assortativity coefficient and show that they arise naturally from epidemic dynamics on networks. Given a fixed partition of the node set, edges are stratified according to whether their endpoints are interior or boundary nodes relative to the partition, yielding type-restricted assortativity components. We prove an exact decomposition theorem showing how classical scalar assortativity collapses heterogeneous interior-boundary interactions into a single number. We then study a SIS epidemic model and consider equilibrium infection probabilities as node attributes. Under mild connectivity and positivity assumptions, we show that boundary dominance (a dynamical concentration of infection mass on interface nodes) implies a strictly negative boundary-to-interior assortativity component. This establishes a rigorous link between directed conductance, equilibrium flow geometry, and the sign structure of assortative mixing induced by the dynamics. Our results demonstrate that assortativity profiles encode dynamical information invisible to scalar summaries and provide a mathematically grounded bridge between network partition geometry and nonlinear dynamics on graphs.</description>

      <title>FSD-CAP: Fractional Subgraph Diffusion with Class-Aware Propagation for Graph Feature Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Inter-edge Correlation Modeling in CopulaGNN for Link Sign Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19175v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN (Ma et al., 2021). However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a racism-spreading model with interaction-driven dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racism remains a persistent societal issue, increasingly amplified by the structure and dynamics of online social networks. In this work, we propose a three-state compartmental model to study the spreading and suppression of racist content, drawing from epidemic-like dynamics and interaction-driven transitions. We analyze the model on fully-connected (homogeneous mixing) networks using a set of coupled differential equations, and on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) scale-free and Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks through agent-based simulations. The system exhibits three distinct stationary regimes: two racism-free absorbing states and one active phase with persistent racist content. We identify and characterize the phase transitions between these regimes, discuss the role of network topology, and highlight the emergence of absorbing states. Our findings illustrate how statistical physics tools can help uncover the macroscopic consequences of microscopic social interactions in digital environments.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Recommendation Model for Psychometric Data, With an Application to Gerontological Primary Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.</description>

      <title>The Big Ban Theory: A Pre- and Post-Intervention Dataset of Online Content Moderation Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms rely on moderation interventions to curb harmful behavior such hate speech, toxicity, and the spread of mis- and disinformation. Yet research on the effects and possible biases of such interventions faces multiple limitations. For example, existing works frequently focus on single or a few interventions, due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. As a result, researchers must typically collect the necessary data for each new study, which limits opportunities for systematic comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we introduce The Big Ban Theory (TBBT), a large dataset of moderation interventions. TBBT covers 25 interventions of varying type, severity, and scope, comprising in total over 339K users and nearly 39M posted messages. For each intervention, we provide standardized metadata and pseudonymized user activity collected three months before and after its enforcement, enabling consistent and comparable analyses of intervention effects. In addition, we provide a descriptive exploratory analysis of the dataset, along with several use cases of how it can support research on content moderation. With this dataset, we aim to support researchers studying the effects of moderation interventions and to promote more systematic, reproducible, and comparable research. TBBT is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18245670.</description>

      <title>Exploring Graph Learning Tasks with Pure LLMs: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for graph tasks. Many studies leverage natural language to describe graphs and apply LLMs for reasoning, yet most focus narrowly on performance benchmarks without fully comparing LLMs to graph learning models or exploring their broader potential. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of LLMs on graph learning tasks, evaluating both off-the-shelf and instruction-tuned models across a variety of scenarios. Beyond accuracy, we discuss data leakage concerns and computational overhead, and assess their performance under few-shot/zero-shot settings, domain transfer, structural understanding, and robustness. Our findings show that LLMs, particularly those with instruction tuning, greatly outperform traditional graph learning models in few-shot settings, exhibit strong domain transferability, and demonstrate excellent generalization and robustness. Our study highlights the broader capabilities of LLMs in graph learning and provides a foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical evidence suggests that there is little to no correlation between the rate of inflation and the size of price change. Economists have hitherto taken this to mean that monetary shocks do not generate much deviation in relative prices and therefore inflation does not hurt the economy by impeding the workings of the price system. This paper presents a production network model of inflationary dynamics in which it is well possible for inflation to have near-zero correlation with the size of price change yet cause significant distortion of relative prices. The relative price distortion caused by inflation critically depends on the spectral gap, degree distribution, and assortativity of the production network.</description>
