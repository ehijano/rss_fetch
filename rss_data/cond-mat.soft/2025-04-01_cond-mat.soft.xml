      <title>Tunable effective diffusion of CO2 in aqueous foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the foam structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial (or osmotic) pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO$_2$-laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a non-linear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam's soap films ($\neq 1$ for CO$_2/$air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Single [2]catenanes in solution forming ${\sf 4}$-plats: a combined field theoretical and numerical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical mechanics of [2]catenanes in a solution with constrained number of maxima and minima along a special direction (the height) is discussed. The interest in this system comes from the fact that, in the homopolymer case, it has analogies with self-dual anyon field theory models and has conformations that minimize the static energy and bear particular symmetries and properties. In the first part of this work we provide a procedure for deriving the equations of motion in the case of replica field theories in the limit of zero replicas. We compute also the partition function of the [2]catenane at the lowest order in the frame of the so-called background field method. In the second part the statistical mechanics of the system is investigated using numerical simulations based on the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method. At equilibrium, independently of the temperature, it turns out that the conformations of the system are elongated in the height directions. The two rings composing the [2]catenanes have approximately the same heights and are aligned. The thermodynamic properties of the system are discussed and the results coming from the field theoretical approach are compared with those of the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Falsifiability Test for Classical Nucleation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical nucleation theory (CNT) is built upon the capillarity approximation, i.e., the assumption that the nucleation properties can be inferred from the bulk properties of the melt and the crystal. Although CNT's simplicity and usefulness cannot be overstated, experiments and simulations regularly uncover significant deviations from its predictions, which are often reconciled through phenomenological extensions of the CNT, fueling the debate over the general validity of the theory. In this study, we present a falsifiability test for any nucleation theory grounded in the capillarity approximation. We focus on cases where the theory predicts no differences in nucleation rates between different crystal polymorphs. We then introduce a system in which all polymorphs have the same free energy (both bulk and interfacial) across all state points. Through extensive molecular simulations, we show that the polymorphs exhibit remarkably different nucleation properties, directly contradicting CNT's predictions. We argue that CNT's primary limitation lies in its neglect of structural fluctuations within the liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Solvation enhances folding cooperativity and the topology dependence of folding rates in a lattice protein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aqueous solvent profoundly influences protein folding, yet its effects are relatively poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the impact of solvation on the folding of lattice proteins by using Monte Carlo simulations. The proteins are modelled as self-avoiding 27-mer chains on a cubic lattice, with compact native states and structure-based G\=o potentials. Each residue that makes no contacts with other residues in a given protein conformation is assigned a solvation energy {\epsilon}_s , representing its full exposure to the solvent. We find that a negative {\epsilon}_s , indicating a favorable solvation, increases the cooperativity of the folding transition by lowering the free energy of the unfolded state, increasing the folding free energy barrier, and narrowing the folding routes. This favorable solvation also significantly improves the correlation between folding rates and the native topology, measured by the relative contact order. Our results suggest that G\=o model may overestimate the importance of native interactions and a solvation potential countering the native bias can play a significant role. The solvation energy in our model can be related to the polar interaction between water and peptide groups in the protein backbone. It is therefore suggested that the solvation of peptide groups may significantly contribute to the exceptional folding cooperativity and the pronounced topology-dependence of folding rates observed in two-state proteins.</description>

      <title>Energetic preference and topological constraint effects on the formation of DNA twisted toroidal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA toroids are compact torus-shaped bundles formed by one or multiple DNA molecules being condensed from the solution due to various condensing agents. It has been shown that the DNA toroidal bundles are twisted. However, the global conformations of DNA inside these bundles are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate this issue by solving different models for the toroidal bundles and performing replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations for self-attractive stiff polymers of various chain lengths. We find that a moderate degree of twisting is energetically favorable for toroidal bundles, yielding optimal configurations of lower energies than in other bundles corresponding to spool-like and constant radius of curvature arrangements. The REMD simulations show that the ground states of the stiff polymers are twisted toroidal bundles with the average twist degrees close to those predicted by the theoretical model. Constant-temperature simulations show that twisted toroidal bundles can be formed through successive processes of nucleation, growth, quick tightening and slow tightening of the toroid, with the two last processes facilitating the polymer threading through the toroid's hole. A relatively long chain of 512 beads has an increased dynamical difficulty to access the twisted bundle states due to the polymer's topological constraint. Interestingly, we also observed significantly twisted toroidal bundles with a sharp U-shaped region in the polymer conformation. It is suggested that this U-shaped region makes the formation of twisted bundles easier by effectively reducing the polymer length. This effect can be equivalent to having multiple chains in the toroid.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter refers to systems composed of self-propelled entities that consume energy to produce motion, exhibiting complex non-equilibrium dynamics that challenge traditional models. With the rapid advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for addressing the complexities of active matter. This review systematically introduces the integration of RL for guiding and controlling active matter systems, focusing on two key aspects: optimal motion strategies for individual active particles and the regulation of collective dynamics in active swarms. We discuss the use of RL to optimize the navigation, foraging, and locomotion strategies for individual active particles. In addition, the application of RL in regulating collective behaviors is also examined, emphasizing its role in facilitating the self-organization and goal-directed control of active swarms. This investigation offers valuable insights into how RL can advance the understanding, manipulation, and control of active matter, paving the way for future developments in fields such as biological systems, robotics, and medical science.</description>

      <title>Penetration of surface effects on structural relaxation and particle hops in glassy films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.</description>

      <title>Dewetting Dynamics of Unstable Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces in Liquid Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article outlines a thorough stability analysis by means of both theoretical and experimental modeling for Omni-phobic Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces (LIS). The liquid-repellent properties, particularly with regard to water and oil, have gained substantial attention due to their numerous potential applications. The theoretical section of this study focuses on the validation of mathematical models to understand the underlying principles driving the stability of Omni-phobic LIS. Theoretical insights about the interaction of surface texture, chemical composition, impregnated, and ambient liquid properties contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern stability. A series of experiments were performed to understand better the stability of fabricated Omni-phobic LIS under cyclopentane and water environments, including viscosity and surface texture variations, especially post-spacing variation. The experimental results validate the theoretical predictions and provide valuable statistical information regarding possible model modification. The replaced oil or nucleation sites can be explained through CHNT. The analysis was further validated with experimentally observed nucleation sites. This confirms the accuracy of the nucleation predictions and supports the underlying theoretical model. According to the CLW model, the length of a liquid's penetration into a cylinder/square-shaped capillary is expressed as a square root of time. Our findings contribute to designing a stable LIS and then determining the model followed by an unstable one. The proposed MLW model validated the experimental results. In addition, these experimental data points fit the different capillary imbibition regimes such as inertial, early viscous etc. This contributes to the development of robust and durable solutions for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Vapor-mediated wetting and imbibition control on micropatterned surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wetting of micropatterned surfaces is ubiquitous in nature and key to many technological applications like spray cooling, inkjet printing, and semiconductor processing. Overcoming the intrinsic, chemistry- and topography-governed wetting behaviors often requires specific materials which limits applicability. Here, we show that spreading and wicking of water droplets on hydrophilic surface patterns can be controlled by the presence of the vapor of another liquid with lower surface tension. We show that delayed wicking arises from Marangoni forces due to vapor condensation, competing with the capillary wicking force of the surface topography. Thereby, macroscopic droplets can be brought into an effective apparent wetting behavior, decoupled from the surface topography, but coexisting with a wicking film, cloaking the pattern. We demonstrate how modulating the vapor concentration in space and time may guide droplets across patterns and even extract imbibed liquids, devising new strategies for coating, cleaning and drying of functional surface designs.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Optical Reconstruction of colloidal electrokinetics via multiplane imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective manipulation of particles is crucial in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology and physics. Dielectrophoresis stands out due to its high selectivity potential and the absence of need for labels. To fully understand and control the phenomenon, observation of the dynamic of nanoparticles under DEP needs to be performed in the three spatial dimensions. However, not many microscopy approaches offer such capability at fast frame rates (&gt;100fps) and high resolution. Here, we used widefield microscopy, to follow the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescently labelled polystyrene nanoparticles of 200 nm under positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions. This real-time 3D imaging technique allows for single particle tracking, enabling super-resolved reconstruction of the DEP force and electrokinetic flows with unprecedented detail. We compare the differences for positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions and rationalize these by direct comparison with dynamic modeling results. The framework shown here shows great promise to elucidate the frequency-dependent DEP behavior of nanoparticle, crucial for particle manipulation and sorting.</description>

      <title>Theory of hydrodynamic forces in electric double layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of the hydrodynamic forces in the drainage flow of an electrolyte between a sphere and a plane with charged surfaces. Our theory considers a thin electrolyte film which is at all times in local equilibrium across its thickness. In addition to the usual lubrication force, we explicit the electro-kinetic force due to the transport of the diffuse electrical charges as well as the diffusio-kinetic force due to the transport of the excess ion concentration in the Electrostatic Double Layers (EDLs). Our general formalism covers both the case of non-overlapping EDLs and of overlapping EDLs. We study more specifically the mechanical impedance induced by an oscillatory motion of small amplitude of the surfaces. Among our main results, we show that the increase in damping due to the electro-kinetic effect is not monotonic with the surface charge, and we predict a diffusio-kinetic stiffness with a long-range decay in power minus four of the sphere-plane gap susceptible to overcoming the stiffness of the equilibrium Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek force. The comparison of our results with experiments could allow one to confront the theories of electrolyte transport in the Electrostatic Double Layers without adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Networking using Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel field theoretical approach towards modelling dynamic networking in complex systems is presented. An equilibrium networking formalism which utilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can bind and unbind from one another. Here, \textit{networking} refers to the introduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not necessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By combining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a weighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The networking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the Langevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible configurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple example of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another demonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in a collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the dynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average number of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for each type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is introduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above a minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate that this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied to a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical predictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Computational Models of Bacterial Interactions in the simulation of Biofilm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of elongated particle interaction models, traditionally used in liquid crystal phase research, in the context of early bacterial biofilm development. Through computer simulations, using an agent based model, of the repulsive and attractive of Kihara models and Hertz interaction model, we investigate the possibilities and limitations for modelling biofilm formation and growth. Our approach focuses on understanding how mechanical forces due to the interaction between cells, in addition to growth and diffusive parameters, influence the formation of complex bacterial communities. By comparing such force models, we evaluate their impact on the structural properties of bacterial microcolonies. The results indicate that, although the specific force model has some effect on biofilm properties, the intensity of the interaction between bacteria is the most important determinant. This study highlights the importance of properly selecting interaction strength in simulations to obtain realistic representations of biofilm growth, and suggests which adapted models of rod-shaped bacterial systems may offer a valid approach to study the dynamics of complex biofilms.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation in Mixtures of Nematic and Isotropic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures of nematic liquid crystals and isotropic fluids display a diverse range of phase behaviors, arising from the coupling between orientational order and concentration fluctuations. In this review, we introduce a simplified mathematical framework that integrates the Landau-de Gennes free energy for nematic ordering with the Cahn-Hilliard free energy for phase separation. We derive the corresponding governing equations and analyze the stability of uniform phases, along with the resulting interfacial phenomena. The review concludes with a brief discussion highlighting key differences in phase separation between mixtures of isotropic fluids with passive and active nematics.</description>

      <title>Renormalized mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of growing model protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of model protocells -- flexible quasispherical vesicles -- that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We identify an associated nonequilibrium morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. This transition emerges due to the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving. Further, using insights from stochastic thermodynamics we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law that remains robust even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Tunable macroscopic defect patterns induced by a low-frequency AC electric field in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulation of topological structures and pattern formation is attracting wide interest in the field of condensed matter. Liquid crystals (LCs) represent soft matter with a remarkable combination of fluidity and anisotropic properties. Topological defects may appear in confined LCs under external stimuli. Recently discovered ferroelectric nematics (NF) opened exceptional opportunities in technologies owing to high permittivity and polarisation. Polar properties of NF supply more variability to topological structures. In this research, we present tunable 2D topological defect arrays in NF compound, induced by an alternating (AC) electric field in simple sandwich cells without pre-patterning. The observed arrays of defects form pseudo-square lattices, which character and periodicity depend on the frequency of the applied field and partially on the cell thickness. The observed effect is explained to occur due to the competition between elastic and electrical forces. The proposed system can be useful to create reconfigurable spatially periodic polarisation structures.</description>

      <title>Ranked percolation model for the caking time of amorphous molecular powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or temperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting the formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over time, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to the formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and affects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous powders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and investigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation threshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate that a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold compared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems. Furthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion values and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into the role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous molecular powders</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of particulate composites derived from ultradense stealthy hyperuniform sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Insights of Domain Unfolding in Fibrin Mechanical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibrinogen, the monomeric unit of fibrin, the main constituent of blood clot, has a very complex structure. The fibrinogen builds the fibrin fiber and network through the half-staggered packing via knob-hole interaction and the $\alpha$C crosslinkers. Due to its rich structure, the elastic behavior also shows a unique nature of very high stretchability and multiple regimes in stress-strain behaviour, which is not yet fully understood. We develop an Unfolding-incorporated Coarse-Grained Polymer (UCGP) model for fibrinogen to study the effect of domain unfolding on the mechanical behavior of fibrin fiber and network. Our model captures the stretching behavior of fibrinogen as observed in AFM and all-atom simulations. We further extend our model to fibrin fiber to study the effect of molecular unfolding at the fiber and network level. We anticipate that our model will be able to account for the nonlinear mechanical behavior of crosslinked fibrin gel. It is possibly the first model of this sort to consider the precise, controllable knowledge of the effects of domain unfolding in crosslinked proteins. This model can also be used to model systems that have sacrificial bonds.</description>

      <title>Simulating cell populations with explicit cell cycle length -- implications to cell cycle dependent tumour therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a stochastic simulation model designed to explicitly incorporate cell cycle length, overcoming limitations associated with classical compartmental models. Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.</description>

      <title>Soil-mimicking microfluidic devices reveal restricted flagellar motility of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens under microconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.</description>

      <title>Meta-Ori: monolithic meta-origami for nonlinear inflatable soft actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear mechanical response of soft materials and slender structures is purposefully harnessed to program functions by design in soft robotic actuators, such as sequencing, amplified response, fast energy release, etc. However, typical designs of nonlinear actuators - e.g. balloons, inverted membranes, springs - have limited design parameters space and complex fabrication processes, hindering the achievement of more elaborated functions. Mechanical metamaterials, on the other hand, have very large design parameter spaces, which allow fine-tuning of nonlinear behaviours. In this work, we present a novel approach to fabricate nonlinear inflatables based on metamaterials and origami (Meta-Ori) as monolithic parts that can be fully 3D printed via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) commercial filaments. Our design consists of a metamaterial shell with cylindrical topology and nonlinear mechanical response combined with a Kresling origami inflatable acting as a pneumatic transmitter. We develop and release a design tool in the visual programming language Grasshopper to interactively design our Meta-Ori. We characterize the mechanical response of the metashell and the origami, and the nonlinear pressure-volume curve of the Meta-Ori inflatable and, lastly, we demonstrate the actuation sequencing of a bi-segment monolithic Meta-Ori soft actuator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technological transition from soft machines to soft robots necessarily passes through the integration of soft electronics and sensors. This allows for the establishment of feedback control systems while preserving the softness of the robot embodiment. Multistable mechanical metamaterials are excellent building blocks of soft machines, as their nonlinear response can be tuned by design to accomplish several functions. In this work, we present the integration of soft capacitive sensors in a multistable mechanical metamaterial, to enable proprioceptive sensing of state changes. The metamaterial is a periodic arrangement of 4 bistable unit cells. Each unit cell has an integrated capacitive sensor. Both the metastructure and the sensors are made of soft materials (TPU) and are 3D printed. Our preliminary results show that the capacitance variation of the sensors can be linked to state transitions of the metamaterial, by capturing the nonlinear deformation.</description>

      <title>Maximum spreading of impacting shear-thinning and shear-thickening drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum spreading of an impacting liquid drop is a key metric for characterizing the fundamental fluid process of drop impact. While extensively studied for Newtonian liquids, how far a non-Newtonian drop can spread upon impacting a solid substrate remains an open question. Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids. Our study addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding the impact dynamics of non-Newtonian drops, and provides valuable guidance for designing non-Newtonian liquids to achieve desired impact outcomes.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase transition.We further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately constant.This constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</description>

      <title>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09477v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Stability of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robot Arms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of variational principles for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is fixed and the other end is free, have received less attention in terms of their stability despite their prevalence. In this article, we establish stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional through the generalized Jacobi condition. This requires computing conjugate points determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to an end load. The rod deformations are modelled using Kirchhoff rod theory. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. The numerical examples highlight its dependence on the system parameters. These examples illustrate potential applications in the design of flexible soft robot arms and innovative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Don't look back: Ordering and defect cloaking in non-reciprocal lattice XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analytical and numerical examination, on square and triangular lattices, of the non-reciprocal planar spin model introduced in Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020). We show that the effect of lattice anisotropy should persist at large scales, leading to a ``mass'' for the angle field of the spins, and behaviour not in the ``Malthusian Toner-Tu'' universality class. Numerically, we find evidence of this mass at large values of our non-reciprocity parameter; for smaller values, we find power-law scaling of long-wavelength equal-time correlators in the polar-ordered phase of our lattice model over the system sizes and wavenumber range explored. Focussing on topological defects, we show numerically that defect interactions are highly anisotropic with respect to the mean ordering direction. In particular, the constituents of a $\pm 1$ pair are shielded from each other in a class of configurations, deferring their annihilation and allowing time for the nucleation of further defects. The result, we show numerically, is the destruction of the polarised phase via an aster apocalypse reminiscent of that found by Besse et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 268003 (2022), for the Malthusian Toner-Tu equation.</description>

Abstract: Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. We numerically investigate the dynamics of several WPEs and find that they self-organize into a bound cluster, akin to a nucleus. This active cluster exhibits various modes of collective excitations as the memory of the system is increased. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective potential indicating an analogy with the bag model of a nucleus. At high memory, the active cluster can destabilize and eject WPEs whose decay statistics follow exponential laws analogous to radioactive nuclear decay. Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs open up new directions to pursue, both experimentally and numerically, within the nascent field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs.</description>

Abstract: We reanalyze the hydrodynamic theory of "flocks" that is, polar ordered "dry" active fluids in two dimensions. For "Malthusian" flocks, in which birth and death cause the density to relax quickly, thereby eliminating density as a hydrodynamic variable, we are able to obtain two exact scaling laws relating the three scaling exponents characterizing the long-distance properties of these systems. We also show that it is highly plausible that such flocks display long-range order in two dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate that for "immortal" flocks, in which the number of flockers is conserved, the extra non-linearities allowed by the presence of an extra slow variable (number density) make it impossible to obtain any exact scaling relations between the exponents. We thereby demonstrate that several past published claims of exact exponents for Malthusian and immortal flocks are all incorrect.</description>

      <title>The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>

Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>

Abstract: The influence of monomer-monomer interactions on the scaling exponents and shape characteristics of a single polymer chain in a selective solvent is investigated using Langevin dynamics simulations. By systematically increasing the temperature of the solution, the effects of interactions between blocks on the conformational properties of the chain are explored. The results demonstrate that longer-range interactions cause a transition of a polymer similar to the transition for homopolymers; short-range repulsive interactions between different blocks have a negligible impact on the effective scaling exponents: they are the same regardless of the blocks being globule and coil or ideal and swollen coils.</description>

      <title>On the temperature, pressure and composition effects in the properties of water-methanol mixtures. I. Density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy, and self-diffusion coefficients from molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the temperature, pressure and composition dependence of some basic properties of model liquid water-methanol mixtures. For this purpose the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations are employed. Our principal focus is on the united atom non-polarizable UAM-I-EW model for methanol which was recently parametrized the paper by Garcia-Melgarejo et al. [J. Mol. Liq., 2021, 323, 114576], combined with the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water model. In perspective, the methanol model permits a convenient extension for other monohydric alcohols mixed with water. The behavior of density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy are described. Partial mixing properties are interpreted. Besides, we explored the trends of behavior of self-diffusion coefficients of the species of a mixture. The quality of predictions of the model is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Various results are novel and provide new insights into the behavior of the mixtures in question at different temperatures and at high pressures. An improvement of the modelling necessary for further research is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Experimentally determined empirical formulae for the concentration dependent relative permittivity of aqueous solutions of MgCl$_{2}$ and NiCl$_{2}$ are utilized to calculate the osmotic coefficient and the mean activity coefficient of these salts for a range of concentrations. The systems are modelled using the primitive model of electrolytes and analyzed using the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the mean spherical approximation, and the Monte Carlo simulations. Generally, the mean spherical approximation and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory reproduce the benchmark simulation data well up to $\sim $1.6 mol/dm$^{3}$ or more in many instances, while the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann results show discrepancies starting from $\sim $0.25 mol/dm$^{3}$. Both the simulations and the theories tend to deviate from the corresponding experimental results beyond $\sim $1 mol/kg.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis reveals universality classes of stochastic spiking neuron networks</title>

Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuits may operate close to ``critical points'' -- boundaries between different phases of collective activity. This has been argued to have functional benefits for neural computation. Studies investigating whether neural circuits are poised near critical points have largely relied on establishing power laws in neural data, while a fundamental understanding of critical phenomena requires a renormalization group (RG) analysis. However, neural activity is typically non-Gaussian, nonlinear, and non-local, rendering models that capture all of these features difficult to study using standard statistical physics techniques. We overcome these issues and adapt the non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) to provide the first RG analysis of networks of stochastic spiking neurons. We show that neural populations can belong to at least two important universality classes: 1) in networks with an absorbing state there is a transition between sustained and extinguished activity that belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and 2) in spontaneously active networks there is a continuous transition between high and low firing rate states that belongs to the Ising model universality class. We verify our theoretical results by simulating the network model on lattices in $2$ and $3$ dimensions, recovering known exponents, and then investigate critical phenomena in networks of sparsely-connected excitatory neurons and densely-connected inhibitory neurons. Depending on the amount of inhibitory feedback, these networks may display mean-field exponents or anomalous exponents close to -- but potentially not equal to -- lattices of the same effective dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated, primarily due to their occurrence at extremely small spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we employ a functional approach to computationally investigate the impact of relatively slow Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we demonstrate that delayed Pi-release significantly enhances energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our simulation results, obtained through parameter variation, successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in machine learning have made its application to anomalous diffusion analysis both essential and inevitable. This review systematically introduces the integration of machine learning techniques for enhanced analysis of anomalous diffusion, focusing on two pivotal aspects: single trajectory characterization via machine learning and representation learning of anomalous diffusion. We extensively compare various machine learning methods, including both classical machine learning and deep learning, used for the inference of diffusion parameters and trajectory segmentation. Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted. On the other hand, we outline three primary strategies for representing anomalous diffusion: the combination of predefined features, the feature vector from the penultimate layer of neural network, and the latent representation from the autoencoder, analyzing their applicability across various scenarios. This investigation paves the way for future research, offering valuable perspectives that can further enrich the study of anomalous diffusion and advance the application of artificial intelligence in statistical physics and biophysics.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>

      <title>Simultaneous active and diffusive behaviour of asymmetric microclusters in a photophoretic trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active and diffusive motion in Brownian particles are regularly observed in fluidic environments, albeit at different time scales. Here, we experimentally study the dynamics of highly asymmetric microclusters trapped in air employing photophoretic forces generated from a loosely focused laser beam, where the trapped particles display active and diffusive dynamics simultaneously in orthogonal spatial directions. Thus, particle motion in the longitudinal direction ($z$) is enslaved to irregular kicks that naturally arise from an interplay of gravitational and photophoretic forces. This leads to a bimodal nature of the probability distribution function with a near-ballistic scaling of mean-squared displacement in the $z$ direction demonstrating active like dynamics, while the dynamics along the transverse ($x$) direction displays diffusive behaviour with a strong dependence on the motion along $z$. To explain these unique characteristics, we developed a 2D-Langevin model of a confined elliptic particle experiencing an additional stochastic force along $z$ to account for the arbitrary jumps. The numerical results show excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Our findings should pave the way for the design of high-efficiency Brownian engines in air, besides stimulating new research in the emerging field of photophoretic trapping.</description>
