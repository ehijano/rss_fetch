      <title>Materials and Design Strategies of Fully 3D Printed Biodegradable Wireless Devices for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) printing of bioelectronics offers a versatile platform for fabricating personalized and structurally integrated electronic systems within biological scaffolds. Biodegradable electronics, which naturally dissolve after their functional lifetime, minimize the long-term burden on both patients and healthcare providers by eliminating the need for surgical retrieval. In this study, we developed a library of 3D-printable, biodegradable electronic inks encompassing conductors, semiconductors, dielectrics, thereby enabling the direct printing of fully functional, multi-material, customizable electronic systems in a single integrated process. Especially, conjugated molecules were introduced to improve charge mobility, energy level alignment in semiconducting inks. This ink platform supports the fabrication of passive/active components and physical/chemical sensors making it suitable for complex biomedical applications. Versatility of this system was demonstrated through two representative applications: (i) wireless pressure sensor embedded within biodegradable scaffolds, (ii) wireless electrical stimulators that retain programmable electrical functionality in vivo and degrade post-implantation. This work establishes a foundation of modules for autonomous, biodegradable bioelectronic systems fabricated entirely via 3D printing, with implications for personalized diagnostics, therapeutic interfaces, and transient medical devices.</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for brain tumor classification using MRI images, leveraging quantum computing for enhanced computational efficiency. A dataset of 3,264 MRI images, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was utilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an oversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model consists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with a filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two models were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor presence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The binary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing, while the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after oversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass model faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit limitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging applications, particularly in binary classification. However, further refinements, including optimized quantum circuit architectures and hybrid classical-quantum approaches, are necessary to enhance multiclass classification accuracy and improve QCNN applicability in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Toward a robust lesion detection model in breast DCE-MRI: adapting foundation models to high-risk women</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis, especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80 \pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model embeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and generalizable breast MRI analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights Into How Rewiring and Bifurcation Angle Affect DK-Crush Stent Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Double Kissing Crush (DKC) is a preferred two-stent technique for complex coronary bifurcation lesions. Proximal cell rewiring is routinely recommended to reduce technical failure, and DKC is considered effective across various bifurcation angles. However, it remains unclear whether this standard approach is optimal for all patients. This study investigates the interaction between bifurcation angle and rewiring configuration to identify anatomy-specific strategies. Methods Computational modeling of the DKC procedure was used to simulate 12 DKC procedures across three left main bifurcation angles (45{\deg}, 70{\deg}, and 100{\deg}) and four rewiring configurations: proximal-proximal (P-P), proximal-distal (P-D), distal-proximal (D-P), and distal-distal (D-D). Evaluation metrics included stent malapposition, side branch ostium clearance, arterial wall stress, low time-averaged endothelial shear stress, and high shear rates. Results DKC performed in wide bifurcations (100{\deg}) resulted in worse outcomes, with malapposition reaching 18%, side branch clearance down to 23%, and up to twice the exposure to adverse high shear rates compared to narrower angles. In contrast, intermediate (70{\deg}) and narrow (45{\deg}) angles generally resulted in more favorable outcomes, though optimal rewiring varied by angle. Proximal strategies, i.e. P-P and P-D, were most effective at 70{\deg}, while D-D performed best at 45{\deg}. No single strategy was consistently superior across all bifurcation angles. Conclusions DKC outcomes depend on bifurcation angle and can be optimized by tailoring rewiring strategies, challenging the current clinical understanding. These findings support anatomy-specific procedural planning and intravascular imaging to guide rewiring. This study provides a mechanistic rationale to improve clinical decision-making and tailor bifurcation interventions.</description>

      <title>Towards a 384-channel magnetoencephalography system based on optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM-MEG) is gaining significant traction as a neuroimaging tool, with the potential for improved performance and practicality compared to conventional instrumentation. However, OPM-MEG has so far lagged conventional-MEG in terms of the number of independent measurements of magnetic field that can be made across the scalp (i.e. the number of channels). This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is &gt;0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices. This represents a significant step on the path towards OPMs becoming the sensor of choice for MEG measurement.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Monte Carlo simulations with gMicroMC: reactive species build-up promotes radical-radical reactions at Flash dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high dose rate irradiations to water indicate an enhancement of radical-radical reactions, which could potentially correlate with the Flash effect. The purpose of this work was to extend gMicroMC to support multiple pulse simulations and Flash dose rates, and to investigate, in a pure water model, the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of radical-radical reactions under Flash conditions. gMicroMC, a GPU-based Monte Carlo track-structure algorithm, was extended to simulate multiple pulses. Pure water was exposed to multiple 70 MeV protons pulses delivering up to 20 Gy. The pulse dose rate was set to 2*10^5 and 10^6 Gy/s, while the average dose rate ranged from 0.01 to 100000 Gy/s. The G-values of H2O2 were used to monitor the influence of dose rate on radical-radical reactions. The multiple pulse extension of gMicroMC was validated against Kinetiscope. Multiple pulse simulations indicated an average dose rate threshold. Below it, complete radical depletion occurred within the pulses, leading to constant G-values. Above it, reactive species accumulated throughout the irradiation, resulting in an increase of radical-radical reactions and thus the G-values of H2O2. The average dose rate thresholds were in the order of 10 and 100 Gy/s for pulse dose rates of 2*10^5 and 10^6 Gy/s, respectively. At ultra-high dose rates, the brief intervals between pulses led to a reactive species build-up, which enhanced radical-radical reactions. This build-up is more likely to promote radical-radical reactions than the inter-track mechanism. The advancements in gMicroMC provide a sophisticated tool to study chemical dose rate dependencies.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Colorimetric Sensing: Achieving over 5700-fold Accuracy Improvement via Full-Spectrum Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional colorimetric sensing methods typically rely on signal intensity at a single wavelength, often selected heuristically based on peak visual modulation. This approach overlooks the structured information embedded in full-spectrum transmission profiles, particularly in intensity-based systems where linear models may be highly effective. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that applying a forward feature selection strategy to normalized transmission spectra, combined with linear regression and ten-fold cross-validation, yields significant improvements in predictive accuracy. Using food dye dilutions as a model system, the mean squared error was reduced from over 22,000 with a single wavelength to 3.87 using twelve selected features, corresponding to a more than 5,700-fold enhancement. These results validate that full-spectrum modeling enables precise concentration prediction without requiring changes to the sensing hardware. The approach is broadly applicable to colorimetric assays used in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and industrial analysis, offering a scalable pathway to improve sensitivity and reliability in existing platforms.</description>

      <title>Image-Guided Surgery: Technology, Quality, Innovation, and Opportunities for Medical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The science and clinical practice of medical physics has been integral to the advancement of radiology and radiation therapy for over a century. In parallel, advances in surgery - including intraoperative imaging, registration, and other technologies within the expertise of medical physicists - have advanced primarily in connection to other disciplines, such as biomedical engineering and computer science, and via somewhat distinct translational paths. This review article briefly traces the parallel and convergent evolution of such scientific, engineering, and clinical domains with an eye to a potentially broader, more impactful role of medical physics in research and clinical practice of surgery. A review of image-guided surgery technologies is offered, including intraoperative imaging, tracking / navigation, image registration, visualization, and surgical robotics across a spectrum of surgical applications. Trends and drivers for research and innovation are traced, including federal funding and academic-industry partnership, and some of the major challenges to achieving major clinical impact are described. Opportunities for medical physicists to expand expertise and contribute to the advancement of surgery in the decade ahead are outlined, including research and innovation, data science approaches, improving efficiency through operations research and optimization, improving patient safety, and bringing rigorous quality assurance to technologies and processes in the circle of care for surgery. Challenges abound but appear tractable, including domain knowledge, professional qualifications, and the need for investment and clinical partnership.</description>

      <title>MR sequence design to account for non-ideal gradient performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MRI systems are traditionally engineered to produce close to idealized performance, enabling a simplified pulse sequence design philosophy. An example of this is control of eddy currents produced by gradient fields; usually these are compensated by pre-emphasizing demanded waveforms. This process typically happens invisibly to the pulse sequence designer, allowing them to assume achieved gradient waveforms will be as desired. Whilst convenient, this requires system specifications exposed to the end-user to be substantially down-rated, since pre-emphasis adds an extra overhead to the waveforms. This strategy is undesirable for lower performance or resource-limited hardware. Instead, we propose an optimization-based method to design pre-compensated gradient waveforms that: (i) explicitly respect hardware constraints and (ii) improve imaging performance by correcting k-space samples directly. Gradient waveforms are numerically optimized by including a model for system imperfections. This is investigated in simulation using an exponential eddy current model, then experimentally using an empirical gradient system transfer function on a 7T MRI system. Our proposed method discovers solutions that produce negligible reconstruction errors while satisfying gradient system limits, even when classic pre-emphasis produces infeasible results. Substantial reduction in ghosting artefacts from EPI imaging was observed, including an average reduction of 77% in ghost amplitude in phantoms. This work demonstrates numerical optimization of gradient waveforms, yielding substantially improved image quality when given a model for system imperfections. While the method as implemented has limited flexibility, it could enable more efficient hardware usage, and may prove particularly important for maximizing performance of lower-cost systems.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Demagnetizing Tensors in Arbitrary Orientations of General Ellipsoid: Implications for MRI Safety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the behaviour of demagnetizing tensors for general ellipsoids under arbitrary rotations in homogeneous magnetic fields. The work is motivated by the concerns in magnetic resonance imaging safety and their practical evaluation in clinical environments. Whereas demagnetizing tensor is a well-defined concept in the principal axes, its transformation under three-dimensional reorientation is often overlooked - a justifiable omission for solutions derived from Poisson equation, where the tensor can be directly rotated. However, this does not hold for common approximations, where such tensor is not explicitly defined. This work demonstrates the validity of directly rotating the orthogonal basis solutions, derived from Poissons equation, and uses the procedure to evaluate a practical approximation, based on orthogonal area-projections. The tensor rotation approach is also applied to generalize force and torque calculations for ellipsoids under three-dimensional re-orientation. The results show an exact match for translation force and torque when compared to the standard single axis rotation. Additionally, a unique connection to the well-known MRI magic angle is found as the point of convergence for prolate spheroid aspect ratios while solving the corresponding saturation field magnitudes. Finally, the evaluated approximate method was demonstrated to perform fairly across prolate and oblate spheroids. Similar approximations might extend to irregular shapes, but numerical validation would likely remain preferable due to the complexity of internal field distributions.</description>
