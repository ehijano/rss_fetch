      <title>Moving Matter: Using a Single, Simple Robot to Reconfigure a Connected Set of Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement and evaluate different methods for the reconfiguration of a connected arrangement of tiles into a desired target shape, using a single active robot that can move along the tile structure. This robot can pick up, carry, or drop off one tile at a time, but it must maintain a single connected configuration at all times.
  Becker et al. (CCCG 2025) recently proposed an algorithm that uses histograms as canonical intermediate configurations, guaranteeing performance within a constant factor of the optimal solution if the start and target configuration are well-separated. We implement and evaluate this algorithm, both in a simulated and practical setting, using an inchworm type robot to compare it with two existing heuristic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Escher Tile Deformation via Closed-Form Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time deformation method for Escher tiles -- interlocking organic forms that seamlessly tessellate the plane following symmetry rules. We formulate the problem as determining a periodic displacement field. The goal is to deform Escher tiles without introducing gaps or overlaps. The resulting displacement field is obtained in closed form by an analytical solution. Our method processes tiles of 17 wallpaper groups across various representations such as images and meshes. Rather than treating tiles as mere boundaries, we consider them as textured shapes, ensuring that both the boundary and interior deform simultaneously. To enable fine-grained artistic input, our interactive tool features a user-controllable adaptive fall-off parameter, allowing precise adjustment of locality and supporting deformations with meaningful semantic control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various examples, including photo editing and shape sculpting, showing its use in applications such as fabrication and animation.</description>

      <title>Passage-traversing optimal path planning with sampling-based algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e., passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths' traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed, enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check. All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.</description>

      <title>$C_4$-free subgraphs of high degree with geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zarankiewicz problem, a cornerstone problem in extremal graph theory, asks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,s}$. While the problem remains widely open in the case of general graphs, the past two decades have seen significant progress on this problem for various restricted graph classes -- particularly those arising from geometric settings -- leading to a deeper understanding of their structure.
  In this paper, we develop a new structural tool for addressing Zarankiewicz-type problems. More specifically, we show that for any positive integer $k$, every graph with average degree $d$ either contains an induced $C_4$-free subgraph with average degree at least $k$, or it contains a $d$-vertex subgraph with $\Omega_k(d^2)$ edges. As an application of this dichotomy, we propose a unified approach to a large number of Zarankiewicz-type problems in geometry, obtaining optimal bounds in each case.</description>

      <title>Linear Layouts of Graphs with Priority Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear layout of a graph consists of a linear ordering of its vertices and a partition of its edges into pages such that the edges assigned to the same page obey some constraint. The two most prominent and widely studied types of linear layouts are stack and queue layouts, in which any two edges assigned to the same page are forbidden to cross and nest, respectively. The names of these two layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the linear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single stack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts have been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue for storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted graphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page are stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show that there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority queues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout with a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an efficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority queues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the pathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of treewidth two. Finally, we prove that determining the minimum number of priority queues is NP-complete if the linear ordering of the vertices is fixed.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received growing attention. While estimating Betti numbers is a central task in TDA, general complexity theoretic limitations restrict the possibility of quantum speedups. To address this, we explore quantum algorithms under a more structured input model. We show that access to additional topological information enables improved quantum algorithms for estimating Betti and persistent Betti numbers. Building on this, we introduce a new approach based on homology tracking, which avoids computing the kernel of combinatorial Laplacians used in prior methods. This yields a framework that remains efficient even when Betti numbers are small, offering substantial and sometimes exponential speedups. Beyond Betti number estimation, we formulate and study the homology property testing problem, and extend our approach to the cohomological setting. We present quantum algorithms for testing triviality and distinguishing homology classes, revealing new avenues for quantum advantage in TDA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study an extension of the notion of the VC-dimension of a hypergraph and apply it to establish a Tverberg type theorem for unions of convex sets. We also prove a new Radon type theorem for unions of convex sets,
  vastly improving the estimates in an earlier result of B\'ar\'any and Kalai.</description>
