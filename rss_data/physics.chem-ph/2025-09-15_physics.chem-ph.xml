      <title>Assessing the Limits of Graph Neural Networks for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium Prediction: A Cryogenic Mixture Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and fast thermophysical models are needed to embed vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations in design, optimization, and control loops for cryogenic mixtures. This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving. An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted coverage near phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer Corrections in Condensed-Phase Ring Polymer Surface Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring-polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a unique mixed quantum-classical dynamics method that seamlessly incorporates nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into non-adiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our results show that the RPSH-CA method, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, reliably captures NQEs and remains robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and non-adiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Conversely, adding DBOC to the conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method was found to over-damp the dynamics significantly and reduce accuracy, especially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the adiabatic reaction regime and at high temperature. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. As such, RPSH-BA is not recommended for including NQEs in condensed-phase non-adiabatic dynamics simulations despite its early successful reports in 1D scattering models. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to non-adiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.</description>

      <title>Artificial Thermalization in Ring-Polymer Molecular Dynamics: The Breakdown of RPMD for Gas-Phase Reactions with Pre-Reactive Complexes and How to Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) has become a popular method for describing chemical reactions due to its ability to simultaneously capture tunneling, zero-point energy, anharmonicity and recrossing. Here we highlight that despite its many successes, great care must be taken when applying RPMD to study gas-phase reactions at low pressure. We show that for bimolecular reactions that proceed via pre-reactive complexes, RPMD predicts spuriously large rates at low temperatures and pressures. Using the rigorous connection of RPMD and semiclassical instanton theory, we demonstrate that this breakdown can be understood in terms of an intrinsic problem with RPMD: artificial thermalization. In the present context, this opens up reactive channels below the reactant asymptote that should be energetically inaccessible, resulting in erroneously large rates. We discuss practical strategies to overcome this problem by combining the steepest-descent inverse Laplace transform with Bleistein's uniform approximation to calculate the thermal rate given an appropriate lower energy bound.</description>

      <title>Reactive Chemistry at Unrestricted Coupled Cluster Level: High-throughput Calculations for Training Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling chemical reactions at the atomistic level requires high-level electronic structure theory due to the presence of unpaired electrons and the need to properly describe bond breaking and making energetics. Commonly used approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) frequently fail for this task due to deficiencies that are well recognized. However, for high-fidelity approaches, creating large datasets of energies and forces for reactive processes to train machine learning interatomic potentials or force fields is daunting. For example, the use of the unrestricted coupled cluster level of theory has previously been seen as unfeasible due to high computational costs, the lack of analytical gradients in many computational codes, and additional challenges such as constructing suitable basis set corrections for forces. In this work, we develop new methods and workflows to overcome the challenges inherent to automating unrestricted coupled cluster calculations. Using these advancements, we create a dataset of gas-phase reactions containing energies and forces for 3119 different organic molecules configurations calculated at the gold-standard level of unrestricted CCSD(T) (coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples). With this dataset, we provide an analysis of the differences between the density functional and unrestricted CCSD(T) descriptions. We develop a transferable machine learning interatomic potential for gas-phase reactions, trained on unrestricted CCSD(T) data, and demonstrate the advantages of transitioning away from DFT data. Transitioning from training to DFT to training to UCCSD(T) datasets yields an improvement of more than 0.1 eV/{\AA} in force accuracy and over 0.1 eV in activation energy reproduction.</description>

      <title>Predictive Free Energy Simulations Through Hierarchical Distillation of Quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining the free energies of condensed phase chemical reactions remains computationally prohibitive for high-level quantum mechanical methods. We introduce a hierarchical machine learning framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge from a small number of high-fidelity quantum calculations into increasingly coarse-grained, machine-learned quantum Hamiltonians. By retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or their uncertainties. Our work demonstrates a path to condensed phase simulations of reaction free energies at the highest levels of accuracy with converged statistics.</description>

      <title>Taylor series perspective on ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations with Fermi-Dirac statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem constitutes a fundamental computational bottleneck across a plethora of research fields in physics, quantum chemistry and related disciplines. Recently, it has been suggested to alleviate the sign problem in \emph{ab initio} path integral Molecular Dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculations based on the simulation of fictitious identical particles that are represented by a continuous quantum statistics variable $\xi$ [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This idea facilitated a host of applications including the interpretation of an x-ray scattering experiment with strongly compressed beryllium at the National Ignition Facility [\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. In the present work, we express the original isothermal $\xi$-extrapolation method as a special case of a truncated Taylor series expansion around the $\xi=0$ limit of distinguishable particles. We derive new PIMC estimators that allow us to evaluate the Taylor coefficients up to arbitrary order and we carry out extensive new PIMC simulations of the warm dense electron gas to systematically analyze the sign problem from this new perspective. This gives us important insights into the applicability of the $\xi$-extrapolation method for different levels of quantum degeneracy in terms of the Taylor series radius of convergence. Moreover, the direct PIMC evaluation of the $\xi$-derivatives, in principle, removes the necessity for simulations at different values of $\xi$ and can facilitate more efficient simulations that are designed to maximize compute time in those regions of the full permutation space that contribute most to the final Taylor estimate of the fermionic expectation value of interest.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of isotope exchange between aqueous solutions and barite in low-temperature geochemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing view that solid-state diffusion is negligible at low temperatures is challenged by rapid sulfur and barium isotope exchange between natural barite crystals and aqueous solutions in laboratory experiments. This assumption relies on diffusivities extrapolated from high-temperature experiments. Here, isotope exchange rates were measured in solutions enriched with 137Ba and 32S at 50 and 80 oC for less than 10,360 hours. SIMS depth profiles revealed 137Ba enrichment to ~75 nm, with shapes characteristic of classical diffusion. Isotope disequilibrium between the barite surface and aqueous solution implies a continuous supply from the interior. These results indicate that defects and vacancies in barite and similar low-temperature minerals enable effective solid-state diffusion, with profound implications for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, materials science, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical modulation of vibrational strong coupling in ReCl(CO)$_3$(2,2-bipyridine)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons - hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of a bright molecular transition with a confined photonic mode - may offer new opportunities for optical control of molecular behavior. Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has been reported to impact ground-state chemical reactivity, but its influence on electronic excited-state dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we take a first step towards excited-state VSC by demonstrating optical modulation of the ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy), (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex under VSC using femtosecond ultraviolet (UV)-pump/infrared (IR)-probe spectroscopy. We establish ground-state VSC of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) in a microfluidic Fabry-P\'erot cavity equipped with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated mirrors. ITO is effectively dichroic as it is reflective in the IR and transmissive in the UV-visible and therefore minimizes optical interference. Excitation with UV pump light drives ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) into a manifold of electronic excited states which subsequently undergo non-radiative relaxation dynamics. We probe the transient response of the strongly-coupled system in the mid-IR, observing both Rabi contraction and cavity-filtered excited state absorption signatures. We reconstruct the intrinsic response of intracavity molecules from the transient cavity transmission spectra to enable quantitative comparison with extracavity control experiments. We report no changes in the excited-state dynamics of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) under ground-state VSC. However, we do observe significant amplification of transient vibrational signals due to classical cavity-enhanced optical effects. This effort lays the groundwork to pursue direct excited-state VSC aimed at modulating photochemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Excited states in auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the calculation of excited states in quantum chemistry using auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Symmetry allows targeting of the lowest triplet excited states in AFQMC based on restricted open-shell determinants, effectively as a ground-state calculation. For open-shell singlet states, excited state calculations can be stabilized with the appropriate trial states, but their quality can have a larger effect on the accuracy in AFQMC. We find that active space-based configuration interaction trial states are often not sufficient to obtain accurate results. We instead use truncated equation of motion coupled cluster with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) as trial states. We benchmark the performance of these calculations on a set of small and medium molecules and polyacenes, focusing on predominantly single excitations. We find that the AFQMC results, obtained at a per-sample cost scaling of $O(N^6)$, are systematically more accurate than those obtained using EOM-CCSD, reducing excitation energy errors by approximately half for open-shell singlets. In regimes where EOM-CC triples are impractical, these results position AFQMC as a scalable, higher-accuracy complement for low-lying excited states.</description>

      <title>Cluster Models for Next-Generation, Machine-Learning-Based Energy Functions for Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy functions for pure and heterogenous systems are one of the backbones for molecular simulation of condensed phase systems. With the advent of machine learned potential energy surfaces (ML-PESs) a new era has started. Statistical models allow the representation of reference data from electronic structure calculations for chemical systems of almost arbitrary complexity at unprecedented detail and accuracy. Here, kernel- and neural network-based approaches for intramolecular degrees of freedom are combined with distributed charge models for long range electrostatics to describe the interaction energies of condensed phase systems. The main focus is on illustrative examples ranging from pure liquids (dichloromethane, water) to chemically and structurally heterogeneous systems (eutectic liquids, CO on amorphous solid water), reactions (Menshutkin), and spectroscopy (triatomic probes for protein dynamics). For all examples, small to medium-sized clusters are used to represent and improve the total interaction energy compared with reference quantum chemical calculations. Although remarkable accuracy can be achieved for some systems (chemical accuracy for dichloromethane and water), it is clear that more realistic models are required for van der Waals contributions and improved water models need to be used for more quantitative simulations of heterogeneous chemical and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Swarm Intelligence for Chemical Reaction Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction optimisation is essential for synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical development, demanding the extensive exploration of many reaction parameters to achieve efficient and sustainable processes. We report $\alpha$-PSO, a novel nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that augments canonical particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with machine learning (ML) for parallel reaction optimisation. Unlike black-box ML approaches that obscure decision-making processes, $\alpha$-PSO uses mechanistically clear optimisation strategies through simple, physically intuitive swarm dynamics directly connected to experimental observables, enabling practitioners to understand the components driving each optimisation decision. We establish a theoretical framework for reaction landscape analysis using local Lipschitz constants to quantify reaction space "roughness", distinguishing between smoothly varying landscapes with predictable surfaces and rough landscapes with many reactivity cliffs. This analysis guides adaptive $\alpha$-PSO parameter selection, optimising performance for different reaction topologies. Systematic evaluation of $\alpha$-PSO across pharmaceutically relevant reaction benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimisation methods, while two prospective high-throughput experimentation (HTE) campaigns showed that $\alpha$-PSO identified optimal reaction conditions more rapidly than Bayesian optimisation. $\alpha$-PSO combines the predictive capability of advanced black-box ML methods with interpretable metaheuristic procedures, offering chemists an effective framework for parallel reaction optimisation that maintains methodological clarity while achieving highly performant experimental outcomes. Alongside our open-source $\alpha$-PSO implementation, we release $989$ new high-quality Pd-catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig and Suzuki reactions.</description>

      <title>Moments-based quantum computation of the electric dipole moment of molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid progress being made in the development of platforms for quantum computation, there has been considerable interest in whether present-day and near-term devices can be used to solve problems of relevance. A commonly cited application area is the domain of quantum chemistry. While most experimental demonstrations of quantum chemical calculations on quantum devices have focused on the ground-state electronic energy of the system, other properties of the ground-state, such as the electric dipole moment, are also of interest. Here we employ the quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on an IBM Quantum superconducting quantum device. The noise-mitigated results agree with full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations to within 0.03 $\pm$ 0.007 debye (2% $\pm$ 0.5%), compared to direct expectation value determination (i.e. VQE) with errors on the order of 0.07 debye (5%), even when the VQE calculation is performed without noise. This demonstrates that moments-based energy estimation techniques can be adapted to noise-robust evaluation of non-energetic ground-state properties of chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Online simplex-structured matrix factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a common task encountered in signal processing and machine learning. Minimum-volume constrained unmixing (MVCU) algorithms are among the most widely used methods to perform this task. While MVCU algorithms generally perform well in an offline setting, their direct application to online scenarios suffers from scalability limitations due to memory and computational demands. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an approach which can build upon any off-the-shelf MVCU algorithm to operate sequentially, i.e., to handle one observation at a time. The key idea of the proposed method consists in updating the solution of MVCU only when necessary, guided by an online check of the corresponding optimization problem constraints. It only stores and processes observations identified as informative with respect to the geometrical constraints underlying SSMF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach when analyzing synthetic and real datasets, showing that it achieves estimation accuracy comparable to the offline MVCU method upon which it relies, while significantly reducing the computational cost.</description>

Abstract: Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function. Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simulations of Two Miscible Fluids in Small Scale Turbulent Mixers Using a Variational Multiscale Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent mixers have been widely used in industrial settings for chemical production and increasingly for therapeutic nanoparticle formulation by antisolvent precipitation. The quality of the product is closely related to the fluid and mixing dynamics inside the mixers. Due to the rapid time scales and small sizes of many turbulent mixing geometries, computational fluid dynamics simulations have been the primary tool used to predict and understand fluid behavior within these mixers. In this study, we used the residual-based variational multiscale finite element method to perform high-fidelity turbulent simulations on two commonly used turbulent mixers: the multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) and the confined impinging jets mixer (CIJM). We simulated two geometric variations, two-inlets and four-inlets, of the MIVM and two different inflow ratios of the CIJM. Through detailed turbulence results, we identify differences in turbulence onset, total energy, and mixing performance of the two MIVM configurations. With the CIJM results, we demonstrate the effect of the flow rate ratio on the impingement behavior, and as a result, on the mixing performance and turbulence. The cross-comparison between the two mixers shows key differences in turbulence and mixing behaviors, such as the turbulence onset, the energy decay, and the output mixing index. This study demonstrates the importance of a high-accuracy numerical scheme in simulating the turbulent mixers and understanding the similarities and differences among mixers. Furthermore, the results show potential for optimizing the operating conditions to achieve the best mixing performance.</description>

      <title>Predicting Structural Relaxation in Supercooled Small Molecules via Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Microscopic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of small organic molecules is critical for applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy and food preservation. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials.</description>

      <title>Large Differences Between Stochastic and Deterministic Kinetics in a Simple Autocatalytic Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In small systems, quantitative discrepancies between stochastic and deterministic descriptions of chemical kinetics can be significant, with their magnitude depending on the specific reaction network. Here, we study the Finke-Watzky model-an irreversible autocatalysis, A + B -- &gt; 2B, supplemented by an irreversible first-order process, A -- &gt; B. This model has been used to describe the formation of transition metal nanoparticles and protein misfolding and aggregation, but it may also serve as a minimal model for the spread of a non-fatal but incurable disease. We show that, for certain parameter values, exceptionally large deviations can arise between stochastic and deterministic kinetics of the Finke-Watzky model. Moreover, its stochastic time evolution may be highly sensitive to initial conditions. These properties are retained in the generalization of the model to reversible reactions. To quantify the differences between the predictions of deterministic and stochastic kinetics, we derive the explicit analytical solution of the Chemical Master Equation for the Finke-Watzky model. This solution also allows us to derive analogous solutions for two related reaction networks: A + A -- &gt; A + B, A -- &gt; B, and A + A -- &gt; A + B, A + B -- &gt; 2B. Our findings may have implications for modeling epidemics and intracellular chemical processes, and more broadly for models of population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network Potential with explicit dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of incorporating explicit dispersion interactions in the functional form of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), particularly in the Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network potential for accurate modeling of liquid carbon tetrachloride, methane, and toluene. We show that explicit incorporation of dispersion interactions via D2 and D3 corrections significantly improves the accuracy of MLIPs when the cutoff radius is set to a commonly used value of 5 -- 6 \r{A}. We also show that for carbon tetrachloride and methane, a substantial improvement in accuracy can be achieved by extending the cutoff radius to 7.5 \r{A}. However, for accurate modeling of toluene, explicit incorporation of dispersion remains important. Furthermore, we find that MLIPs incorporating dispersion interactions via D2 reach a close level of accuracy to those incorporating D3, and D2 is suitable for accurate modeling of the systems in the study, while being less computationally expensive. We evaluated the accuracy of MLIPs in dimer binding curves compared to ab initio data and in predicting density and radial distribution functions compared to experiments.</description>

      <title>A deep learning model for chemical shieldings in molecular organic solids including anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts are powerful probes of local atomic and electronic structure that can be used to resolve the structures of powdered or amorphous molecular solids. Chemical shift driven structure elucidation depends critically on accurate and fast predictions of chemical shieldings, and machine learning (ML) models for shielding predictions are increasingly used as scalable and efficient surrogates for demanding ab initio calculations. However, the prediction accuracies of current ML models still lag behind those of the DFT reference methods they approximate, especially for nuclei such as $^{13}$C and $^{15}$N. Here, we introduce ShiftML3.0, a deep-learning model that improves the accuracy of predictions of isotropic chemical shieldings in molecular solids, and does so while also predicting the full shielding tensor. On experimental benchmark sets, we find root-mean-squared errors with respect to experiment for ShiftML3.0 that approach those of DFT reference calculations, with RMSEs of 0.53 ppm for $^{1}$H, 2.4 ppm for $^{13}$C, and 7.2 ppm for $^{15}$N, compared to DFT values of 0.49 ppm, 2.3 ppm, and 5.8 ppm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multi-head committees enable direct uncertainty prediction for atomistic foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials have become a standard tool for atomistic materials modelling. While models continue to become more generalisable, an open challenge relates to efficient uncertainty predictions for active learning and robust error analysis. In this work, we utilise MACE and its multi-head mechanism to implement a committee neural network potential for message-passing architectures, where the committee comprises multiple output modules attached to the same atomic environment descriptors. As with traditional committees of independent networks, the standard deviation of the predictions functions as an estimate of the model's uncertainty. We show for a range of datasets in custom-build models that the uncertainty of the force predictions correlates well with the true errors. We subsequently apply this concept to foundation models, specifically MACE-MP-0, where we train only the newly attached output heads while keeping the remaining part of the model fixed. We use this approach in an active learning workflow to condense the training set of the foundation model to just 5\% of its original size. The foundation model multi-head committee trained on the condensed training set enables reliable uncertainty estimation without any substantial decrease in prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>MolErr2Fix: Benchmarking LLM Trustworthiness in Chemistry via Modular Error Detection, Localization, Explanation, and Revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Coarse Graining Photo-Isomerization Reactions: Thermodynamic Consistency and Implications for Molecular Ratchets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals that their design and optimization should prioritize molecular properties governing the information ratchet mechanism, rather than those influencing energetic bias.</description>
