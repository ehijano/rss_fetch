      <title>Learning mechanical systems from real-world data using discrete forced Lagrangian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven method for learning the equations of motion of mechanical systems directly from position measurements, without requiring access to velocity data. This is particularly relevant in system identification tasks where only positional information is available, such as motion capture, pixel data or low-resolution tracking. Our approach takes advantage of the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle and the forced discrete Euler-Lagrange equations to construct a physically grounded model of the system's dynamics. We decompose the dynamics into conservative and non-conservative components, which are learned separately using feed-forward neural networks. In the absence of external forces, our method reduces to a variational discretization of the action principle naturally preserving the symplectic structure of the underlying Hamiltonian system. We validate our approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to baseline methods. In particular, we apply our model to (1) measured human motion data and (2) latent embeddings obtained via an autoencoder trained on image sequences. We demonstrate that we can faithfully reconstruct and separate both the conservative and forced dynamics, yielding interpretable and physically consistent predictions.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Control Improves Residential Building Energy and EV Management when PV Capacity is High but Battery Capacity is Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches (Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions, early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full electricity system and its decarbonization.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Distributed P2P Energy Trading via Spatial-Temporal Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mandates an escalating coupling between the physical power network and communication network, necessitating high-frequency sharing of real-time data among prosumers. However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. {The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading via Hybrid Secure Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers' volatile energy power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed privacy-preserving approach.</description>

      <title>On Kernel Design for Regularized Volterra Series Identification of Wiener-Hammerstein Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been increasing interests on the Volterra series identification with the kernel-based regularization method. The major difficulties are on the kernel design and efficiency of the corresponding implementation. In this paper, we first assume that the underlying system to be identified is the Wiener-Hammerstein (WH) system with polynomial nonlinearity. We then show how to design kernels with nonzero off-diagonal blocks for Volterra maps by taking into account the prior knowledge of the linear blocks and the structure of WH systems. Moreover, exploring the structure of the designed kernels leads to the same computational complexity as the state-of-the-art result, i.e., $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the sample size, but with a significant difference that the proposed kernels are designed in a direct and flexible way. In addition, for a special case of the kernel and a class of widely used input signals, further exploring the separable structure of the output kernel matrix can lower the computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(N\gamma^2)$, where $\gamma$ is the separability rank of the output kernel matrix and can be much smaller than $N$. We finally run Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the proposed kernels and the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Existence and Design of Target Output Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target output controllers aim at regulating a system's target outputs by placing poles of a suitable subsystem using partial state feedback, where full state controllability is not required. This paper establishes existence conditions for such controllers using input and partial state data, where the system dynamics are unknown. The approach bypasses traditional system identification steps and leverages the intrinsic structure of historical data to certify controller existence and synthesize a suitable feedback gain. Analytical characterizations are provided, ensuring that the resulting closed-loop system satisfies desired performance objectives such as pole placement or stabilization. Data-driven algorithms are then proposed to design target output controllers directly from data without identifying system parameters, where controllers with the order matching the number of target outputs and with minimum-order augmented target outputs are both addressed. Furthermore, a separation principle is revealed, decoupling the design of target output controllers from state observers. This enables the development of data-driven observer-based controllers that integrate estimation and control. Numerical examples validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Cross-Domain Predictive Control of Tapered Amplifier Thermal Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally induced laser noise poses a critical limitation to the sensitivity of quantum sensor arrays employing ultra-stable amplified lasers, primarily stemming from nonlinear gain-temperature coupling effects in tapered amplifiers (TAs). To address this challenge, we present a robust intelligent control strategy that synergistically integrates an encoder-decoder physics-informed gated recurrent unit (PI-GRU) network with a model predictive control (MPC) framework. Our methodology incorporates physical soft constraints into the neural network architecture, yielding a predictive model with enhanced physical consistency that demonstrates robust extrapolation capabilities beyond the training data distribution. Leveraging the PI-GRU model's accurate multi-step predictive performance, we implement a hierarchical parallel MPC architecture capable of real-time thermal instability compensation. This hybrid approach achieves cross-domain consistent thermal stabilization in TAs under diverse laser power operations. Remarkably, while trained exclusively on low-power operational data, our system demonstrates exceptional generalization, improving prediction accuracy by 58.2% and temperature stability by 69.1% in previously unseen high-power operating regimes, as experimentally validated. The novel synchronization of physics-informed neural networks with advanced MPC frameworks presented in this work establishes a groundbreaking paradigm for addressing robustness challenges in cross-domain predictive control applications, overcoming conventional modeling limitations.</description>

      <title>Effective Fixed-Time Control for Constrained Nonlinear System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the state transformation problem in non-strict full state-constrained systems by introducing an adaptive fixed-time control method, utilizing a one-to-one asymmetric nonlinear mapping auxiliary system. Additionally, we develop a class of multi-threshold event-triggered control strategies that facilitate autonomous controller updates, substantially reducing communication resource consumption. Notably, the self-triggered strategy distinguishes itself from other strategies by obviating the need for continuous real-time monitoring of the controller's state variables. By accurately forecasting the subsequent activation instance, this strategy significantly optimizes the efficiency of the control system. Moreover, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the semi-global practical fixed-time stability (SPFTS) criterion guarantees both tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability under state constraints, with convergence time independent of initial conditions. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed method significantly decreases the frequency of control command updates while maintaining tracking accuracy.</description>

      <title>Research on a Two-Layer Demand Response Framework for Electric Vehicle Users and Aggregators Based on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased the importance of demand response in smart grids. This paper proposes a two-layer demand response optimization framework for EV users and aggregators, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to balance electricity supply and demand and optimize energy utilization during EV charging. The upper-layer model, focusing on the aggregator, aims to maximize profits by adjusting retail electricity prices. The lower-layer model targets EV users, using LLMs to simulate charging demands under varying electricity prices and optimize both costs and user comfort. The study employs a multi-threaded LLM decision generator to dynamically analyze user behavior, charging preferences, and psychological factors. The framework utilizes the PSO method to optimize electricity prices, ensuring user needs are met while increasing aggregator profits. Simulation results show that the proposed model improves EV charging efficiency, alleviates peak power loads, and stabilizes smart grid operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, there is a necessity for advanced technologies that can provide reliable situational awareness and communication. Conventional systems are often inadequate due to unreliable infrastructure, power grid failures, high investment costs and scalability challenges. This paper explores the potential of ad-hoc mesh joint radar and communication (JRC) networks as a scalable, resilient, energy-efficient solution for disaster management that can operate independently of conventional infrastructure. The proposed JRC network enhances disaster response by integrating target detection (such as identifying vital signs, hazardous leaks, and fires) with communication capabilities to ensure efficient information dissemination under intense clutter conditions. Key performance metrics, including data rate, Signal-to-Clutter and Noise Ratio (SCNR), probability of detection, and false alarm rate, are used to assess performance. An optimization approach is proposed to provide an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. The results show the performance of ad-hoc mesh JRC systems, underscoring their potential to enhance disaster management efforts by addressing unique operational challenges.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Process Control Using Multi-Task Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, process systems engineering must adapt to digital transformation. While reinforcement learning offers a model-free approach to process control, its applications are limited by the dependence on accurate digital twins and well-designed reward functions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with multi-task learning for data-driven, multi-mode control design. Using historical closed-loop data as expert demonstrations, IRL extracts optimal reward functions and control policies. A latent-context variable is incorporated to distinguish modes, enabling the training of mode-specific controllers. Case studies on a continuous stirred tank reactor and a fed-batch bioreactor validate the effectiveness of this framework in handling multi-mode data and training adaptable controllers.</description>

      <title>Output Regulation of Linear Systems with Non-periodic Non-smooth Exogenous Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the output regulation problem of linear systems with non-smooth and non-periodic exogenous signals. Specifically, we first formulate and solve the full-information problem by designing a state-feedback controller. We study the solvability of the regulator equations, providing a new non-resonance condition. We then focus on the error-feedback problem, for which we design a (non-robust) internal model leveraging the concept of canonical realisation and applying a high-gain method for the stabilisation of the closed-loop system under the minimum-phase assumption. Finally, we study the regulation problem involving model parameter uncertainties. Drawing ideas from both hybrid and time-varying (smooth) output regulation, we propose two methods to establish an internal model that is robust to uncertainties. The first method is an extension of the hybrid internal model, while the second relies on a new concept of immersion. In this non-smooth case, the immersion is established based on integrals rather than derivatives. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is illustrated by a circuit regulation example.</description>

      <title>Active Learning-Enhanced Dual Control for Angle-Only Initial Relative Orbit Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate relative orbit determination is a key challenge in modern space operations, particularly when relying on angle-only measurements. The inherent observability limitations of this approach make initial state estimation difficult, impacting mission safety and performance. This work explores the use of active learning (AL) techniques to enhance observability by dynamically designing the input excitation signal offline and at runtime. Our approach leverages AL to design the input signal dynamically, enhancing the observability of the system without requiring additional hardware or predefined maneuvers. We incorporate a dual control technique to ensure target tracking while maintaining observability. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating the initial relative state of the chaser and target spacecrafts and its robustness to various initial relative distances and observation periods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry-Based Performance Evaluation for LEO Satellite-Assisted Space Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve the Internet of Things (IoT) vision,Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising technology aimed at providing low-latency computing services to user equipment (UE). However, terrestrial MEC network struggles to provide service to UEs in remote and maritime region. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks have the potential to overcome geographical restrictions and provide seamless global coverage for UEs. In this paper, we provide the first attempt to use stochastic geometry to investigate the performance of implementing space caching with LEO satellites (SATs) in the MEC network. We study a LEO satellite-assisted space caching MEC network, and LEO SATs can be equipped with servers to enable space caching, with the advantage of seamless coverage to assist terrestrial CSs for serving UEs in remote or maritime reigon. Using stochastic geometry and queuing theory, we establish an analytical framework for this MEC network. Meanwhile, we develop association strategies for UEs to connect with LEO SATs or CSs and utilize stochastic geometry to derive uplink and downlink coverage probabilities, considering the diversity of task and service types. On this basis, we employ the queuing theory to calculate the average delay to evaluate the system performance. Through Monte Carlo simulations and numerical results, the system performance is evaluated. The results show the potential of SAT spatial caching in improving the performance of the MEC network. Additionally, our results reveal useful insights such as the significant impact of the altitude and number of LEO SATs on the average delay of the network, providing helpful system-level recommendations for the design and configuration of the space-caching MEC network.</description>

      <title>Distributed equilibrium seeking in aggregative games: linear convergence under singular perturbations lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully-distributed algorithm for Nash equilibrium seeking in aggregative games over networks. The proposed scheme endows each agent with a gradient-based scheme equipped with a tracking mechanism to locally reconstruct the aggregative variable, which is not available to the agents. We show that our method falls into the framework of singularly perturbed systems, as it involves the interconnection between a fast subsystem - the global information reconstruction dynamics - with a slow one concerning the optimization of the local strategies. This perspective plays a key role in analyzing the scheme with a constant stepsize, and in proving its linear convergence to the Nash equilibrium in strongly monotone games with local constraints. By exploiting the flexibility of our aggregative variable definition (not necessarily the arithmetic average of the agents' strategy), we show the efficacy of our algorithm on a realistic voltage support case study for the smart grid.</description>

      <title>WiCAL: Accurate Wi-Fi-Based 3D Localization Enabled by Collaborative Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D localization is essential for realizing advanced sensing functionalities in next-generation Wi-Fi communication systems. This study investigates the potential of multistatic localization in Wi-Fi networks through the deployment of multiple cooperative antenna arrays. The collaborative gain offered by these arrays is twofold: (i) intra-array coherent gain at the wavelength scale among antenna elements, and (ii) inter-array cooperative gain across arrays. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of this approach, we develop WiCAL (Wi-Fi Collaborative Antenna Localization), a system built upon commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure equipped with uniform rectangular arrays. These arrays are driven by multiplexing embedded radio frequency chains available in standard access points or user devices, thereby eliminating the need for sophisticated, costly, and power-hungry multi-transceiver modules typically required in multiple-input and multiple-output systems. To address phase offsets introduced by RF chain multiplexing, we propose a three-stage, fine-grained phase alignment scheme to synchronize signals across antenna elements within each array. A bidirectional spatial smoothing MUSIC algorithm is employed to estimate angles of arrival (AoAs) and mitigate performance degradation caused by correlated interference. To further exploit inter-array cooperative gain, we elaborate on the synchronization mechanism among distributed URAs, which enables direct position determination by bypassing intermediate angle estimation. Once synchronized, the distributed URAs effectively form a virtual large-scale array, significantly enhancing spatial resolution and localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quasi Steady-State Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</description>

      <title>ZV-Sim: Probabilistic Simulation Framework for Pre-emergent Novel Zoonose Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ZV-Sim is an open-source, modular Python framework for probabilistic simulation and analysis of pre-emergent novel zoonotic diseases using pervasive sensing data. It incorporates customizable Human and Animal Presence agents that leverage known and simulated location data, contact networks, and illness reports to assess and predict disease origins and spread. The framework supports Monte Carlo experiments to analyze outcomes with various user-defined movement and probability models. Although initial models are basic and illustrative, ZV-Sim's extensible design facilitates the integration of more sophisticated models as richer data become available, enhancing future capabilities in zoonotic disease tracking. The source code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/jmaff/zv-sim}{\underline{\textit{here}}}.</description>

      <title>Stability of two-dimensional SISO LTI system with bounded feedback gain that has bounded derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional SISO LTI system closed by uncertain linear feedback. The feedback gain is time-varying, bounded, and has a bounded derivative (both bounds are known). We investigate the asymptotic stability of this system under all admissible behaviors of the gain. Note that the situation is similar to the classical absolute stability problem of Lurie--Aizerman with two differences: linearity and derivative constraint. Our method of analysis is therefore inspired by the variational ideas of Pyatnitskii, Barabanov, Margaliot, and others developed for the absolute stability problem. We derive the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for a function describing the "most unstable" of the possible portraits of the closed-loop system. A numerical method is proposed for solving the equation. Based on the solution, sufficient conditions are formulated for the asymptotic stability and instability. The method is applied to an equation arising from the analysis of a power electronics synchronization circuit.</description>

      <title>Numerical estimation of the lock-in domain of a DC/AC inverter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the lock-in domain of the origin of a current control system which is used in common DC/AC inverter designs. The system is a cascade connection of a 4-dimensional linear system (current controller, CC) followed by a two-dimensional nonlinear system (phase-locked loop, PLL). For the PLL, we construct a Lyapunov function via numerical approximation of its level curves. In combination with the quadratic Lyapunov function of the CC, it forms a vector Lyapunov function (VLF) for the overall system. A forward-invariant set of the VLF is found via numerical application of the comparison principle. By LaSalle's invariance principle, convergence to the origin is established.</description>

      <title>Robot Operation of Home Appliances by Reading User Manuals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and (iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured, symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model reduction simplifies complex dynamical systems while preserving essential properties. This paper revisits a recently proposed system-theoretic framework for least squares moment matching. It interprets least squares model reduction in terms of two steps process: constructing a surrogate model to satisfy interpolation constraints, then projecting it onto a reduced-order space. Using tools from output regulation theory and Krylov projections, this approach provides a new view on classical methods. For illustration, we reexamine the least-squares model reduction method by Lucas and Smith, offering new insights into its structure.</description>

      <title>Collision-free Control Barrier Functions for General Ellipsoids via Separating Hyperplane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel collision avoidance method for general ellipsoids based on control barrier functions (CBFs) and separating hyperplanes. First, collision-free conditions for general ellipsoids are analytically derived using the concept of dual cones. These conditions are incorporated into the CBF framework by extending the system dynamics of controlled objects with separating hyperplanes, enabling efficient and reliable collision avoidance. The validity of the proposed collision-free CBFs is rigorously proven, ensuring their effectiveness in enforcing safety constraints. The proposed method requires only single-level optimization, significantly reducing computational time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Numerical simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: An unmanned deformable vehicle is a wheel-legged robot transforming between two configurations: vehicular and humanoid states, with different motion modes and stability characteristics. To address motion stability in multiple configurations, a center-of-mass adjustment mechanism was designed. Further, a motion stability hierarchical control algorithm was proposed, and an electromechanical model based on a two-degree-of-freedom center-of-mass adjustment mechanism was established. An unmanned-deformable-vehicle vehicular-state steady-state steering dynamics model and a gait planning kinematic model of humanoid state walking were established. A stability hierarchical control strategy was designed to realize the stability control. The results showed that the steady-state steering stability in vehicular state and the walking stability in humanoid state could be significantly improved by controlling the slider motion.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Partitioning with Probabilistic Feasibility and Performance Guarantees for Chance-Constrained Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel distribution-free scheme to solve optimization problems where the goal is to minimize the expected value of a cost function subject to probabilistic constraints. Unlike standard sampling-based methods, our idea consists of partitioning the uncertainty domain in a user-defined number of sets, enabling more flexibility in the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that our approximated problem is feasible for the original stochastic program, in terms of chance constraint satisfaction. In addition, we perform a rigorous performance analysis, by quantifying the distance between the optimal values of the original and the approximated problem. We show that our approach is tractable for optimization problems that include model predictive control of piecewise affine systems, and we demonstrate the benefits of our approach, in terms of the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity, on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A domain adaptation neural network for digital twin-supported fault diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins offer a promising solution to the lack of sufficient labeled data in deep learning-based fault diagnosis by generating simulated data for model training. However, discrepancies between simulation and real-world systems can lead to a significant drop in performance when models are applied in real scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), which enables knowledge transfer from simulated (source domain) to real-world (target domain) data. We evaluate the proposed framework using a publicly available robotics fault diagnosis dataset, which includes 3,600 sequences generated by a digital twin model and 90 real sequences collected from physical systems. The DANN method is compared with commonly used lightweight deep learning models such as CNN, TCN, Transformer, and LSTM. Experimental results show that incorporating domain adaptation significantly improves the diagnostic performance. For example, applying DANN to a baseline CNN model improves its accuracy from 70.00% to 80.22% on real-world test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain adaptation in bridging the sim-to-real gap.</description>

      <title>Robustness to Model Approximation, Model Learning From Data, and Sample Complexity in Wasserstein Regular MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies the robustness properties of discrete-time stochastic optimal control under Wasserstein model approximation for both discounted cost and average cost criteria. Specifically, we study the performance loss when applying an optimal policy designed for an approximate model to the true dynamics compared with the optimal cost for the true model under the sup-norm-induced metric, and relate it to the Wasserstein-1 distance between the approximate and true transition kernels. A primary motivation of this analysis is empirical model learning, as well as empirical noise distribution learning, where Wasserstein convergence holds under mild conditions but stronger convergence criteria, such as total variation, may not. We discuss applications of the results to the disturbance estimation problem, where sample complexity bounds are given, and also to a general empirical model learning approach, obtained under either Markov or i.i.d. learning settings.</description>

      <title>Designing RF-Powered Battery-Less Electronic Shelf Labels With COTS Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a preliminary study exploring the feasibility of designing batteryless electronic shelf labels (ESLs) powered by radio frequency wireless power transfer using commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed ESL design is validated through a dedicated testbed and involves a detailed analysis of design choices, including energy consumption, energy conversion, and storage solutions. A leaded aluminium electrolytic capacitor is selected as the primary energy storage element, balancing cost and performance while maintaining compactness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that an ESL can update its display within 4 to 120 minutes, depending on input power and RF frequency, with harvester efficiencies reaching up to 30 %. Challenges such as low harvester efficiency, extended update times, and hardware constraints are identified, highlighting opportunities for future optimizations. This work provides valuable insights into system design considerations for RF-powered ESLs and establishes a foundation for further research in energy-neutral Internet of Things applications.</description>

      <title>A Control-Oriented Simplified Single Particle Model with Grouped Parameter and Sensitivity Analysis for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in transportation, energy storage, and consumer electronics, driving the need for reliable battery management systems (BMS) for state estimation and control. The Single Particle Model (SPM) balances computational efficiency and accuracy but faces challenges in parameter estimation due to numerous parameters. Current SPM models using parabolic approximation introduce intermediate variables and hard to do parameter grouping. This study presents a control-oriented SPM reformulation that employs parameter grouping and parabolic approximation to simplify model parameters while using average and surface lithium-ion concentrations as model output. By parameter grouping, the original 17 parameters were reduced to 9 grouped parameters. The reformulated model achieves a reduced-order ordinary differential equation form while maintaining mathematical accuracy equivalent to the pre-grouped discretized SPM. Through Sobol sensitivity analysis under various current profiles, the grouped parameters were reduced from 9 to 6 highly sensitive parameters. Results demonstrate that estimating these 6 parameters achieves comparable practical accuracy to estimating all 9 parameters, with faster convergence. This control-oriented SPM enhances BMS applications by facilitating state estimation and control while reducing parameter estimation requirements.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Prediction Model for Time Series Characterized by GARCH via Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GARCH-type time series (characterized by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) exhibit pronounced volatility, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>DeepCEE: Efficient Cross-Region Model Distributed Training System under Heterogeneous GPUs and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing training systems focus on a single region. In contrast, we envision that cross-region training offers more flexible GPU resource allocation and yields significant potential. However, the hierarchical cluster topology and unstable networks in the cloud-edge-end (CEE) environment, a typical cross-region scenario, pose substantial challenges to building an efficient and autonomous model training system. We propose DeepCEE, a geo-distributed model training system tailored for heterogeneous GPUs and networks in CEE environments. DeepCEE adopts a communication-centric design philosophy to tackle challenges arising from slow and unstable inter-region networks. It begins with a heterogeneous device profiler that identifies and groups devices based on both network and compute characteristics. Leveraging device groups, DeepCEE implements compact, zero-bubble pipeline parallelism, automatically deriving optimal parallel strategies. To further adapt to runtime variability, DeepCEE integrates a dynamic environment adapter that reacts to network fluctuations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepCEE achieves 1.3-2.8x higher training throughput compared to widely used and SOTA training systems.</description>

      <title>Full LTL Synthesis over Infinite-state Arenas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, interest has increased in applying reactive synthesis to richer-than-Boolean domains. A major (undecidable) challenge in this area is to establish when certain repeating behaviour terminates in a desired state when the number of steps is unbounded. Existing approaches struggle with this problem, or can handle at most deterministic games with B\"uchi goals. This work goes beyond by contributing the first effectual approach to synthesis with full LTL objectives, based on Boolean abstractions that encode both safety and liveness properties of the underlying infinite arena. We take a CEGAR approach: attempting synthesis on the Boolean abstraction, checking spuriousness of abstract counterstrategies through invariant checking, and refining the abstraction based on counterexamples. We reduce the complexity, when restricted to predicates, of abstracting and synthesising by an exponential through an efficient binary encoding. This also allows us to eagerly identify useful fairness properties. Our discrete synthesis tool outperforms the state-of-the-art on linear integer arithmetic (LIA) benchmarks from literature, solving almost double as many syntesis problems as the current state-of-the-art. It also solves slightly more problems than the second-best realisability checker, in one-third of the time. We also introduce benchmarks with richer objectives that other approaches cannot handle, and evaluate our tool on them.</description>

      <title>A Concentration Bound for TD(0) with Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a concentration bound of the type `for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become popular for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model and uses constraint tightening to account for model mismatch. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</description>

      <title>Policy Design for Two-sided Platforms with Participation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-sided platforms (e.g., video streaming or e-commerce), viewers and providers engage in interactive dynamics: viewers benefit from increases in provider populations, while providers benefit from increases in viewer population. Despite the importance of such "population effects" on long-term platform health, recommendation policies do not generally take the participation dynamics into account. This paper thus studies the dynamics and recommender policy design on two-sided platforms under the population effects for the first time. Our control- and game-theoretic findings warn against the use of the standard "myopic-greedy" policy and shed light on the importance of provider-side considerations (i.e., effectively distributing exposure among provider groups) to improve social welfare via population growth. We also present a simple algorithm to optimize long-term social welfare by taking the population effects into account, and demonstrate its effectiveness in synthetic and real-data experiments. Our experiment code is available at https://github.com/sdean-group/dynamics-two-sided-market.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$-diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth Poincar\'{e} conjecture.</description>

      <title>Radar Network for Gait Monitoring: Technology and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, radar-based devices have emerged as an alternative approach for gait monitoring. However, the radar configuration and the algorithms used to extract the gait parameters often differ between contributions, lacking a systematic evaluation of the most appropriate setup. Additionally, radar-based studies often exclude motorically impaired subjects, leaving it unclear whether the existing algorithms are applicable to such populations. In this paper, a radar network is developed and validated by monitoring the gait of five healthy individuals and three patients with Parkinson's disease. Six configurations and four algorithms were compared using Vicon as ground-truth to determine the most appropriate solution for gait monitoring. The best results were obtained using only three nodes: two oriented towards the feet and one towards the torso. The most accurate stride velocity and distance in the state of the art were obtained with this configuration. Moreover, we show that analyzing the feet velocity increases the reliability of the temporal parameters, especially with aged or motorically impaired subjects. The contribution is significant for the implementation of radar networks in clinical and domestic environments, as it addresses critical aspects concerning the radar network configuration and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-stage deep learning framework for the inverse design of rectangular patch antennas. Our approach leverages generative modeling to learn a latent representation of antenna frequency response curves and conditions a subsequent generative model on these responses to produce feasible antenna geometries. We further demonstrate that leveraging search and optimization techniques at test-time improves the accuracy of the generated designs and enables consideration of auxiliary objectives such as manufacturability. Our approach generalizes naturally to different design criteria, and can be easily adapted to more complex geometric design spaces.</description>
