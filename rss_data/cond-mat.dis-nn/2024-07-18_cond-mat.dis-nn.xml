      <title>Topological effect on the Anderson transition in chiral symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of an emergent quasi-localized phase in chiral symmetry classes, where wave function along a spatial direction with weak topology is delocalized but exponentially localized along the other directions. The Anderson transition in 2D chiral symmetry classes is induced by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs of a U(1) phase degree of freedom, while the weak topology endows the pair with the Berry phase. We argue that the Berry phase induces spatial polarizations of the pairs along the topological direction through the quantum interference effect, and the proliferation of the polarized vortex pairs results in the quasi-localized phase.</description>

      <title>Quenches in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is a prototype of a complex non-convex energy landscape. Dynamical processes evolving on such landscapes and locally aiming to reach minima are generally poorly understood. Here, we study quenches, i.e. dynamics that locally aim to decrease energy. We analyse the energy at convergence for two distinct algorithmic classes, single-spin flip and synchronous dynamics, focusing on greedy and reluctant strategies. We provide precise numerical analysis of the finite size effects and conclude that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the reluctant algorithm is compatible with converging to the ground state energy density, while the greedy strategy is not. Inspired by the single-spin reluctant and greedy algorithms, we investigate two synchronous time algorithms, the sync-greedy and sync-reluctant algorithms. These synchronous processes can be analysed using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), and a new backtracking version of DMFT. Notably, this is the first time the backtracking DMFT is applied to study dynamical convergence properties in fully connected disordered models. The analysis suggests that the sync-greedy algorithm can also achieve energies compatible with the ground state, and that it undergoes a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Long-time properties of generic Floquet systems are approximately periodic with the driving period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Floquet quantum system is governed by a Hamiltonian that is periodic in time. Consider the space of piecewise time-independent Floquet systems with (geometrically) local interactions. We prove that for all but a measure zero set of systems in this space, starting from a random product state, many properties (including expectation values of observables and the entanglement entropy of a macroscopically large subsystem) at long times are approximately periodic with the same period as the Hamiltonian. Thus, in almost every Floquet system of arbitrarily large but finite size, discrete time-crystalline behavior does not persist to strictly infinite time.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Shot Noise in a Dirty Marginal Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study shot noise in a two-dimensional, disordered marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) driven out of equilibrium. We consider electrons with Planckian dissipation on the Fermi surface coupled to quantum-critical bosons in the presence of disorder. In the non-interacting and strong electron-boson drag limits, MFL effects disappear and our theory reproduces known results. For the case where the bosons remain in equilibrium, inelastic scattering strongly suppresses the noise by dissipating the injected energy. Interestingly, we find that MFL effects do play a role in this regime, and give a weak enhancement on top of the otherwise strong suppression. Our results suggest that shot noise can be strongly suppressed in quantum-critical systems, and this scenario may be relevant to recent measurements in a heavy-fermion strange metal.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>
