      <title>Spectral statistics of the Laplacian on random covers of a closed negatively curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,g)$ be a closed, connected surface, with variable negative curvature. We consider the distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on random covers $X_n\to X$ of degree $n$. We focus on the ensemble variance of the smoothed number of eigenvalues of the square root of the positive Laplacian $\sqrt{\Delta}$ in windows $[\lambda-\frac 1L,\lambda+\frac 1L]$, over the set of $n$-sheeted covers of $X$. We first take the limit of large degree $n\to +\infty$, then we let the energy $\lambda$ go to $+\infty$ while the window size $\frac 1L$ goes to $0$. In this ad hoc limit, local energy averages of the variance converge to an expression corresponding to the variance of the same statistic when considering instead spectra of large random matrices of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). By twisting the Laplacian with unitary representations, we are able to observe different statistics, corresponding to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) when time reversal symmetry is broken. These results were shown by F. Naud for the model of random covers of a hyperbolic surface.
  For an individual cover $X_n\to X$, we consider spectral fluctuations of the counting function on $X_n$ around the ensemble average. In the large energy regime, for a typical cover $X_n\to X$ of large degree, these fluctuations are shown to approach the GOE result, a phenomenon called ergodicity in Random Matrix Theory. An analogous result for random covers of hyperbolic surfaces was obtained by Y. Maoz.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for $C^2$ long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a complete stationary scattering theory for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge 2$, with $C^2$ long-range potentials. This extends former results in the literature, in particular [Is1, Is2, II, GY], which all require a higher degree of smoothness. In this sense the spirit of our paper is similar to [H\"o2, Chapter XXX], which also develops a scattering theory under the $C^2$ condition, however being very different from ours. While the Agmon-H\"ormander theory is based on the Fourier transform, our theory is not and may be seen as more related to our previous approach to scattering theory on manifolds [IS1,IS2,IS3]. The $C^2$ regularity is natural in the Agmon-H\"ormander theory as well as in our theory, in fact probably being `optimal' in the Euclidean setting. We prove equivalence of the stationary and time-dependent theories by giving stationary representations of associated time-dependent wave operators. Furthermore we develop a related stationary scattering theory at fixed energy in terms of asymptotics of generalized eigenfunctions of minimal growth. A basic ingredient of our approach is a solution to the eikonal equation constructed from the geometric variational scheme of [CS]. Another key ingredient is strong radiation condition bounds for the limiting resolvents originating in [HS]. They improve formerly known ones [Is1, Sa] and considerably simplify the stationary approach. We obtain the bounds by a new commutator scheme whose elementary form allows a small degree of smoothness.</description>

      <title>Low energy resolvent asymptotics of the multipole Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute low energy asymptotics for the resolvent of the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles for both integer and non-integer total fluxes. For integral total flux we reduce to prior results in black-box scattering while for non-integral total flux we build on the corresponding techniques using an appropriately chosen model resolvent. The resolvent expansion can be used to obtain long-time wave asymptotics for the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles. An interesting phenomenon is that if the total flux is an integer then the scattering resembles even-dimensional Euclidean scattering, while if it is half an odd integer then it resembles odd-dimensional Euclidean scattering. The behavior for other values of total flux thus provides an `interpolation' between these.</description>

      <title>From resolvent expansions at zero to long time wave expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a general abstract theorem deducing wave expansions as time goes to infinity from resolvent expansions as energy goes to zero, under an assumption of polynomial boundedness of the resolvent at high energy. We give applications to obstacle scattering, to Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonians, to scattering in a sector, and to scattering by a compactly supported potential.</description>

      <title>Entropy of logarithmic modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.13528v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, boundaryless, Riemannian manifold whose geodesic flow on its unit sphere bundle is Anosov. Consider the (semiclassical) Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$. Let $\epsilon &gt;0$.
  We study the semiclassical measures $\mu_{sc}$ of quasimodes spectrally supported in intervals of width $\epsilon \frac{h}{|\log h|}$, a critical-type regime when considering ``delocalization". We derive a lower bound for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of $\mu_{sc}$ that depends explicitly on $\epsilon$, in the spirit of that given by Ananthamaran-Koch-Nonnenmacher.</description>
