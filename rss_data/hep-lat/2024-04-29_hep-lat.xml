      <title>Flow-based Nonperturbative Simulation of First-order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a flow-based method for simulating and calculating nucleation rates of first-order phase transitions in scalar field theory on a lattice. Motivated by recent advancements in machine learning tools, particularly normalizing flows for lattice field theory, we propose the ``partitioning flow-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (PFMCMC) sampling" method to address two challenges encountered in normalizing flow applications for lattice field theory: the ``mode-collapse" and ``rare-event sampling" problems. Using a (2+1)-dimensional real scalar model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PFMCMC method in modeling highly hierarchical order parameter probability distributions and simulating critical bubble configurations. These simulations are then used to facilitate the calculation of nucleation rates. We anticipate the application of this method to (3+1)-dimensional theories for studying realistic cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Detailed derivation of the $\mathbf{^3P_0}$ strong decay model applied to baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-detail derivation through the $^3P_0$ pair creation model of the transition matrix for a baryon decaying into a meson-baryon system. The meson's analysis was conducted in Ref. [1] and we extend the same formalism to the baryon sector, focusing on the $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ strong decay width because all hadrons involved in the reaction are very well established, the two hadrons in the final state are stable, avoiding further analysis, all quarks are light and so equivalent, and the decay width of the process is relatively well measured. Taking advantage of a Gaussian expansion method for the hadron's radial wave functions, the expression of the invariant matrix element can be related with the mean-square radii of hadrons involved in the decay. We use their experimental measures in such a way that only the strength of the quark-antiquark pair creation from the vacuum is a free parameter. This is then taken from our previous study of strong decay widths in the meson sector, obtaining a quite compatible result with experiment for the calculated $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ decay width.</description>

      <title>Exact symmetry conservation and automatic mesh refinement in discrete initial boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel solution procedure for initial boundary value problems. The procedure is based on an action principle, in which coordinate maps are included as dynamical degrees of freedom. This reparametrization invariant action is formulated in an abstract parameter space and an energy density scale associated with the space-time coordinates separates the dynamics of the coordinate maps and of the propagating fields. Treating coordinates as dependent, i.e. dynamical quantities, offers the opportunity to discretize the action while retaining all space-time symmetries and also provides the basis for automatic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The presence of unbroken space-time symmetries after discretization also ensures that the associated continuum Noether charges remain exactly conserved. The presence of coordinate maps in addition provides new freedom in the choice of boundary conditions. An explicit numerical example for wave propagation in $1+1$ dimensions is provided, using recently developed regularized summation-by-parts finite difference operators.</description>

      <title>QCD Anderson transition with overlap valence quarks on a twisted-mass sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we probe the QCD Anderson transition by studying spectral distributions of the massless overlap operator on gauge configurations created by the twisted mass at finite temperature collaboration (tmfT) with 2+1+1 flavors of dynamical quarks and the Iwasaki gauge action. We assess finite-size and discretization effects by considering two different lattice spacings and several physical volumes, and mimic the approach to the continuum limit through stereographic projection. Fitting the inflection points of the participation ratios of the overlap Dirac eigenmodes, we obtain estimates of the temperature dependence of the mobility edge, below which quark modes are localized. We observe that it is well-described by a quadratic polynomial and systematically vanishes at temperatures below the pseudocritical one of the chiral transition. In fact, our best estimates within errors overlap with that of the chiral phase transition temperature of QCD in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Solving the left-hand cut problem in lattice QCD: $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ from finite volume energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a novel effective-field-theory-based approach for extracting two-body scattering information from finite volume energies, serving as an alternative to L\"uscher's method. By explicitly incorporating one-pion exchange, we overcome the challenging left-hand cut problem in L\"uscher's method and can handle finite volume energy levels both below and above the left-hand cut. Applied to the lattice data for $DD^*$ scattering at a pion mass of 280 MeV, as an illustrative example, our results reveal the significant impact of the one-pion exchange on P-wave and S-wave phase shifts. The pole position of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ state, extracted from the finite-volume energy levels at this pion mass while taking into account left-hand cut effects, range corrections and partial-wave mixing, is consistent with a near-threshold resonance. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that two-body scattering information can be reliably extracted from lattice spectra including the left-hand cut.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the $D_s^{*}$ radiative decay with (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a lattice calculation on the radiative decay of $D_s^*$ using the (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover gauge ensembles generated by CLQCD collaboration. A method allowing us to calculate the form factor with zero transfer momentum is proposed and applied to the radiative transition $D_s^*\rightarrow D_s\gamma$ and the Dalitz decay $D_s^*\rightarrow D_s e^+e^-$. After a continuum extrapolation using three lattice spacings, we obtain $\Gamma(D_s^*\rightarrow D_s \gamma)=0.0549(54)$ keV, where the error is purely statistical. The result is consistent with previous lattice calculations but with a error reduced to only a fifth of the before. The Dalitz decay rate is also calculated for the first time and the ratio with the radiative transition is found to be $R_{ee}=0.624(3)\%$. A total decay width of $D_s^*$ can then be determined as 0.0587(54) keV taking into account the experimental branching fraction. Combining with the most recent experimental measurement on the branching fraction of the purely leptonic decay $D_s^{+,*}\rightarrow e^+\nu_e$, we obtain the quantity $f_{D_s^*}|V_{cs}|=(190.5^{+55.1}_{-41.7_{\textrm{stat.}}}\pm 12.6_{\textrm{syst.}})$ MeV, where the stat. is only the statistical error from the experiment, and syst. results from the experimental systematic uncertainty and the lattice statistical error. Our result leads to an improved systematic uncertainty compared to $42.7_{\textrm{syst.}}$ obtained using previous lattice prediction of total decay width $0.070(28)$ keV as the input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently-established connection between Jarzynski's equality and the theoretical framework of Stochastic Normalizing Flows, we investigate a protocol relying on out-of-equilibrium lattice Monte Carlo simulations to mitigate the infamous computational problem of topological freezing. We test our proposal on $2d$ $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ models and compare our results with those obtained adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions proposed by M. Hasenbusch, obtaining comparable performances. Our work thus sets the stage for future applications combining our Monte Carlo setup with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Evaluating matrix power series with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cayley-Hamilton theorem is used to implement an iterative process for the efficient numerical computation of matrix power series and their differentials. In addition to straight-forward applications in lattice gauge theory simulations e.g. to reduce the computational cost of smearing, the method can also be used to simplify the evaluation of SU(N) one-link integrals or the computation of SU(N) matrix logarithms.</description>

      <title>Wegner's Ising gauge spins versus Kitaev's Majorana partons: Mapping and application to anisotropic confinement in spin-orbital liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent gauge theories take a prominent role in the description of quantum matter, supporting deconfined phases with topological order and fractionalized excitations. A common construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, first introduced by Wegner, involves Ising gauge spins placed on links and subject to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauss law constraint. As shown by Kitaev, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories also emerge in the exact solution of certain spin systems with bond-dependent interactions. In this context, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is constructed from Majorana fermions, with gauge constraints given by the parity of Majorana fermions on each site. In this work, we provide an explicit Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps between these two formulations on the square lattice, where the Kitaev-type gauge theory emerges as the exact solution of a spin-orbital (Kugel-Khomskii) Hamiltonian. We then apply our mapping to study local perturbations to the spin-orbital Hamiltonian, which correspond to anisotropic interactions between electric-field variables in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. These are shown to induce anisotropic confinement that is characterized by emergence of weakly-coupled one-dimensional spin chains. We study the nature of these phases and corresponding confinement transitions in both absence and presence of itinerant fermionic matter degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss how our mapping can be applied to the Kitaev spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions from Boosted Fields in the Coulomb Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to calculate parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice correlations of boosted quarks and gluons in the Coulomb gauge. Compared to the widely used gauge-invariant Wilson-line operators, these correlations greatly simplify the renormalization thanks to the absence of linear power divergence. Besides, they enable access to larger off-axis momenta under preserved 3D rotational symmetry, as well as enhanced long-range precision that facilitates the Fourier transform. We verify the factorization formula that relates this new observable to the quark PDF at one-loop order in perturbation theory. Moreover, through a lattice calculation of the pion valence quark PDF, we demonstrate the aforementioned advantage and features of the Coulomb gauge correlation and show that it yields consistent result with the gauge-invariant method. This opens the door to a more efficient way to calculate parton physics on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Entanglement R\'{e}nyi Negativity of Interacting Fermions from Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We conduct the first calculation of rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model and find that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>
