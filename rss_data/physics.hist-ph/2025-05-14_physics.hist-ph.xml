      <title>Revisiting the Einstein-de Haas experiment: the Amp{\`e}re Museum's hidden treasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unearthed in the Amp{\`e}re Museum near Lyon, France, a genuine version of the Einstein-de Haas experiment apparatus offers a rare glimpse into Einstein's experimental interests. This remarkable find not only connects us to a crucial epoch in history of science but also highlights Einstein's rare tangible legacy in the realm of experimental physics.</description>

      <title>Against Radical Relationalism: in Defense of the Ordinal Structure of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some authors in the quantum gravity community endorse, explicitly or implicitly, a radical relationalist view of time which states that the ordinal structure of time is not needed even in our classical theories, especially in general relativity. In this article I analyze this position and the arguments supporting it, and I argue that there are some serious concerns with some of the radical relationalists' arguments which make it an unattractive position. In this sense, I conclude that the chrono-ordinal structures of our theories play important theoretical and explanatory roles and that they can be taken to be part of the empirical content of our theories.</description>

      <title>Imagination and Understanding through Astrophysical Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific articles, for instance in the field of astrophysics, are often filled with a variety of images. In philosophical studies, these images are usually analyzed in terms of their function within the scientific argument presented in the article. However, not all images that can be found in astrophysical articles are relevant to the scientific argument, which prompts the question of why they are included in the first place. Using the example of the so-called Stellar Graveyard plot, I argue that the work of Letitia Meynell provides a valuable description of this kind of imagery. That is, there are images used in astrophysical literature that may not be necessary for the scientific argument, but function as an aide for the visual imagination of the reader. These kinds of aides can help with mentally visualizing certain spatial configurations and the causal relationships within them, ultimately furthering understanding of the discussed astrophysical concepts or models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Antikythera Mechanism s Central Front dial parts Division and Placement of the Zodiac Dial ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze, discuss and present the design of the Antikythera Mechanism s central front parts. Based on the aligned and of same scale visual images of Fragment C front/back face and the X-ray CT scacs, we designed and reconstructed in bronze, the four independent parts comprising the central front dial. We then correlated the zodiac dial ring with 365 equal subdivisions-days and we investigated the number of days per astronomical season and per zodiac month. Then, we adopted a specific number of equal subdivisions/days per each zodiac month and we engraved these on the bronze zodiac month ring. The different number of days per zodiac month created 12 unequal epicenter angles on the zodiac dial ring and therefore the solar anomaly and the unequal time span of the astronomical seasons were well represented on the Antikythera Mechanism. In this way, the functionality of the central front dial of the Mechanism was achieved by adopting the minimum number of hypotheses.</description>
