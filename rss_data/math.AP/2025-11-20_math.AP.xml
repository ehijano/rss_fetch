      <title>Yang-Mills instanton on a four dimensional wormhole: asymptotic stability in the energy space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills field propagating in the $4+1$ dimensional wormhole spacetime. Assuming the spherically symmetric magnetic ansatz the problem reduces to a one dimensional non linear wave equation. This equation posses a degree one solution (instanton) which is odd in space. We consider small, odd perturbations of the instanton and show that it is conditionally asymptotically stable in the odd energy space.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary equations with state-dependent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a contraction mapping argument for ordinary state-dependent delay differential equations to evolutionary partial differential equations in the sense of R. Picard, that is, to equations of the form $\bigl(\partial_{t} M(\partial_{t}) + A\bigr) u(t) = F\bigl(t,u_{(t)}\bigr)$, where $A$ is an $\mathrm{m}$-accretive (unbounded) linear operator and $M$ is a material law. We establish local well-posedness (in the sense of weak solutions) of generalized initial value problems that stem from a distributional formulation. We require prehistories in $H^{1}$ with bounded derivative, a regularity increasing right-hand side and a consistency condition. We showcase the viability of our results by applying them to classical examples (heat, wave and Maxwell's equations), examples from semigroup theory, port-Hamiltonian systems, as well as equations featuring fractional derivatives and convolutions (in time) with bounded operators.</description>

      <title>A strong quantitative form of the fractional isoperimetric inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a strong version of the fractional quantitative isoperimetric inequality, in which the isoperimetric deficit controls not only the Fraenkel asymmetry but also a sort of oscillation of the boundary. This generalizes the local result by Fusco and Julin in \cite{FJ}. The proof follows a regularization process as in \cite{FJ} but it is quite different in its spirit. Then, as a consequence of the quantitative inequality, we prove some stability estimates for a fractional Cheeger inequality.</description>

      <title>A Liouville theorem for convex functions with periodic Monge-Amp\`ere measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu \not\equiv 0$ be a nonnegative locally finite periodic Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show that any convex solution to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation \[ \det D^2 u = \mu \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^n \] admits a unique decomposition (up to addition of constants) as the sum of a quadratic polynomial and a periodic function. This result extends, in full generality, the earlier works for the case $\mu=f(x)\,\mathrm{d} x$: when $\log f \in C^\alpha$, it was established by Caffarelli and Li; and when $\log f$ is merely bounded, it was proved by Li and Lu. Our result thus answers a question raised by Li and Lu. A key ingredient in the proof is a new dichotomous Harnack-type inequality for linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations with nonnegative periodic measures.</description>

      <title>The existence and instability of blowing-up steady states for the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto competition model with cross-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and instability of a class of blowing-up positive steady states arising in a shadow system of the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) two-species competition model, as well as in the corresponding perturbed SKT model with a sufficiently large cross-diffusion coefficient and bounded random diffusion parameters. In their classical work (Lou-Ni, 1999), it was shown that, under the limit where one cross-diffusion parameter tends to infinity, coexistence steady states of the SKT model are characterized by three types of shadow systems. In a previous study (Kuto, 2015), the first author analyzed one of these shadow systems in one space dimension (the second shadow system) and proved that a component of a bifurcating branch blows up as the bifurcation parameter approaches the first positive Neumann eigenvalue of $-\Delta$. In the present paper, using a new approach based on suitable transformations and the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, we derive the existence and detailed asymptotic structure of several branches of positive steady states near blow-up points for shadow systems with one or two cross-diffusion terms, in both one- and multi-dimensional domains. We further show that all such large-amplitude steady state branches are spectrally unstable. Moreover, by means of perturbation arguments, we establish the existence and instability of corresponding branches of perturbed positive steady states for the original SKT model when one cross-diffusion coefficient is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Global Gevrey solution of 3D anisotropic Navier-Stokes system in a strip domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible anisotropic Navier-Stokes system with dissipation only in the horizontal variables, posed in a strip domain. To overcome the difficulties arising from the boundary terms and the absence of vertical dissipation, we impose a Gevrey-class regularity condition in the vertical direction. For the remaining directions, we prove that the solution exhibits space-time analytic or Gevrey-class regularization. Furthermore, the solution is shown to possess an enhanced Gevrey regularity in the direction of strong diffusion, which is unconstrained by boundaries.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to subcritical Choquard systems with double couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Choquard system with both linear and nonlinear couplings
  $-\Delta u + \mu_1 u =\lambda_1 ( I_\alpha * |u|^{r_1} ) |u|^{r_1-2} u + \beta p( I_\alpha * |v|^q)|u|^{p-2} u + \kappa v,$
  $-\Delta v + \mu_2 v =\lambda_2 ( I_\alpha * |v|^{r_2} ) |v|^{r_2-2} v + \beta q( I_\alpha * |u|^p)|v|^{q-2} v + \kappa u , $
  $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2 = \rho_1^2\, , \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} v^2 = \rho_2^2,$ where $N \in \{3,4\}$, $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \beta, \kappa, \rho_1,\rho_2 &gt; 0$, $2_{\alpha,*} :=\frac{N+\alpha}{N} &lt;p,q , r_1, r_2 &lt;2_\alpha^*:=\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}$ and $p+q\leq 2r_1 \leq 2r_2$ . We investigate a classification result as the parameters $p+q$, $2r_1$ and $2r_2$ vary across the ranges $(\frac{2N+2\alpha}{N},\frac{2N+2\alpha+4}{N})$,
  $\{\frac{2N+2\alpha+4}{N}\}$, and $(\frac{2N+2\alpha+4}{N},\frac{2N+2\alpha}{N-2})$. Employing variational methods, we demonstrate the existence of a normalized ground state for the system in the mass subcritical, critical, and supercritical cases.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-magnetic Fields and Effective Dynamics in Strained Honeycomb Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain offers a straightforward and effective method for generating pseudo-magnetic fields in optical and acoustic materials, thereby enabling precise manipulation of wave propagation. In this article, we investigate and justify wave packet dynamics localized near Dirac points in strained honeycomb-structured media. We develop a novel approach based on spectral analysis to control the error from second-order differential residue terms caused by the strain. The analysis yields a two-dimensional Dirac equation with nontrivial gauge fields governing the envelope dynamics, which is proved to well approximate the true solution in a long but finite time. These results contribute to the mathematical understanding of pseudo-magnetic effects in strained honeycomb structures and pave the way to systems with general higher-order perturbation terms.</description>

      <title>Sharp $L^4$ Strichartz estimate for Hyperbolic Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the sharp $L^4$ Strichartz estimate without derivative loss for the hyperbolic Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$, \begin{equation} \|e^{it (\partial_{x_{1}}^2-\partial_{x_{2}}^2)} \phi\|_{L^4_{t,x_{1},x_{2}}([0,1]\times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T})}\lesssim \|\phi\|_{L_{x_{1},x_{2}}^2(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T})}, \end{equation} which serves as the hyperbolic analogue of the classical result of Takaoka-Tzvetkov \cite{takaoka20012d}. The proof is based on the combination of a robust kernel decomposition method with precise measure estimates for semi-algebraic sets. As an immediate application, we establish the global well-posedness for the cubic hyperbolic Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$ in the $L^2$-critical space with sufficiently small initial data.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow-up analysis for the generalized Proudman-Johnson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized Proudman-Johnson equation posed on the torus. In the critical regime where the parameter $a$ is close to and slightly greater than 1, we establish finite time blow-up of smooth solutions to the inviscid case. Moreover, we show that the blow-up is asymptotically self-similar for a class of smooth initial data. In contrast, when the parameter $a$ lies slightly below 1, we prove the global in time existence for the same initial data. In addition, we demonstrate that inviscid Proudman-Johnson equation with H\"{o}lder continuous data also develops a self-similar blow-up. Finally, for the viscous case with $a&gt;1$, we prove that smooth initial data can still lead to finite time blow-up.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and time-asymptotic of Boltzmann equations for monatomic and polyatomic mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a system of Boltzmann equations modelling the mixture of monatomic and polyatomic gases in an $L^{2}-L^{\infty}$ perturbation theory around global modified Maxwellians accounting for the internal energy of the mixture in the whole space and the torus. We investigate the pointwise decay in velocity and internal energy of the linearized Boltzmann operators in the four types of collisions. A novel approach is developed to deal with the additional internal energy variable $I\in \mathbb{R}_+$ and the loss of symmetry due to dissimilar masses of the mixture components. Subsequently, we carry out a classical $L^2-L^\infty$ method to establish the well-posedness theory of the system. The optimal polynomial time decay rate on the whole space is obtained accordingly based on the spatial Fourier's study of the linearized system. The analysis shows the structure of a perturbed Euler-type model for the solution's macroscopic quantities: density, bulk velocity, and temperature, near the steady state, which gives a potential application to investigate fluid limit problems. In addition, this work proves exponential time decay in the torus and fills the gap of classical multi-species Boltzmann in the whole space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the problem on Runge pairs for Sobolev solutions of strongly uniformly parabolic systems in non-cylindrical domains of a special kind. We prove that if the coefficients of a parabolic operator are constant, then two domains with sufficiently smooth boundaries, no parts of which are parallel to the plane $t=0$, form a Runge pair if and only if the complements of any section of the larger domain to the section of the smaller domain by planes $t = const$, have no compact components in the larger section.</description>

      <title>Solving Newell-Whitehead-Segel and Allen-Cahn Equations Employing Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis with Spline Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) by using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The Newell-Whitehead-Segel (NWS) equation and the Allen-Cahn equation belong to fundamental PDEs used mostly in various scientific disciplines. Different methods, including analytical and numerical approaches, have been proposed for solving these equations alongside the recently introduced PINN method. This study provides a detailed and comprehensive comparison between the developed PINN method and the state-of-the-art spline numerical solution for the NWS and Allen-Cahn equation. Furthermore, the computational time of the trained PINN models is evaluated to determine their computational efficiency. The findings show that PINN is significantly better than spline methods in solving both problems.</description>

      <title>On the Long Time Existence of a Fractional KdV-BBM Type Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a fractional Korteweg de Vries-Benjamin Bona Mahony (KdV-BBM) type equation including both fractional dispersive terms of fractional KdV and fractional BBM equations. We aim to enhance the existence time of solutions with small initial data $|| u_0||_{H^{N+\alpha/2}}= \epsilon$ from $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ to $\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$. The proof relies on the combination of a modified energy method with Fourier techniques. In addition, the long time existence issues are investigated numerically. Numerical observations of the lifespan give an evidence of existence of solutions beyond the hyperbolic time scale. This study provides a detailed analysis from both analytical and numerical aspects for the existence of smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>A Wave Front Tracking Scheme for Flux Reconstruction in $2\times 2$ Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel wave front tracking framework for reconstructing unknown flux functions in $2\times 2$ hyperbolic conservation laws, extending beyond the well-studied scalar case. By analyzing Riemann solutions at fixed observation times, we develop explicit reconstruction formulas that handle arbitrary combinations of shock and rarefaction waves through a unified equivalent shock concept. Our method constructs piecewise quadratic $C^1$ flux approximations with rigorous convergence guarantees: the approximation errors decrease quadratically with the discretization parameters for function values and linearly for derivatives under $C^{1,1}$ regularity, with enhanced cubic and quadratic convergence respectively under $C^3$ regularity. Applications to the isentropic Euler equations and the mathematically equivalent p-system in compressible fluid dynamics demonstrate the method's capability to identify complete equations of state from limited dynamic measurements, providing a systematic approach to a fundamental inverse problem in continuum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Normalized Solutions for the $(2,q)$-Laplacian Operator Between Mass-Critical Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence of normalized solutions to a class of $(2,q)$-Laplacian equations with a power type nonlinearity in the intermediate regime between the two mass critical exponents $2(1+2/N)$, $q(1+2/N)$. More precisely, we prove the existence of solutions with negative energy obtained through a global minimization procedure, and of solutions with positive energy established via a local minimization technique and a mountain-pass argument. Furthermore, we derive both existence and nonexistence results for the zero-mass case $\lambda = 0$, highlighting the role of the mixed diffusion in determining the qualitative behavior of solutions. Specifically, this paper's novelty lies in providing a comprehensive understanding of the intermediate cases that arise when the non-homogeneous $(2,q)$-Laplacian operator appears. Our analysis combines variational methods, compactness arguments, and delicate energy estimates adapted to the nonhomogeneous nature of the $(2,q)$-Laplacian operator.</description>

      <title>The Rabinowitz continuum of subcritical Gelfand problems and free boundary-type equations arising in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The qualitative behavior of the Rabinowitz unbounded continuum of subcritical Gelfand problems is well known on balls in any dimension. We don't know of any such sharp and detailed description otherwise, which is our motivation to look for a new approach to the problem. The underlying idea is to describe solutions of Gelfand problems via suitably defined constrained problems of free boundary-type arising in plasma physics and to replace the usual $L^\infty$ norm of the solution with the energy of the plasma. Toward this goal, we first solve a long standing open problem of independent interest about the uniqueness of solutions of Grad-Shafranov type equations. Thus, we exploit these unique solutions to detect a curve containing both minimal and non minimal solutions of the associated Gelfand problem. In other words we come up with a new global parametrization of the Rabinowitz continuum, the monotonicity of the energy along the branch providing a meaningful generalization of the classical pointwise monotonicity property of minimal solutions, suitable to describe non minimal solutions as well. On a ball in any dimension, we come up as expected with a bell-shaped profile of the full branch of solutions of the Gelfand problem.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Resource Distribution in a One-Dimensional Logistic Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the optimization of resource distributions in a one-dimensional logistic diffusive model. The goal is to determine a distribution on a bounded one-dimensional domain that maximizes the total population at equilibrium. Previous works have shown that optimal resources are bang-bang, and in one dimension, a sufficiently large dispersal rate forces the optimal resource to be concentrated. For general dispersal rates, however, the analysis becomes more difficult because the equilibrium population may behave irregularly, and the optimal resource may be fragmented. To address this, we introduce a block decomposition that reduces fragmented resources to a collection of concentrated blocks. We then define an advantage function, which measures the gain in the equilibrium population obtained by allocating resources on a fixed interval and is used to analyze the contribution of each block to the total population. This function also allows us to reformulate the optimization problem as a convexity analysis of the advantage function. We prove the superlinearity of this function when the total resource is small enough, and this property leads to an explicit characterization of the optimal control with sufficiently small total resource.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of planar entropy wave for 3-d Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-time asymptotic behavior toward the planar entropy wave for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates, considering two types of initial perturbations -- with and without the assumption that the integral of the initial perturbation is zero. Generic perturbations generate diffusion waves, and structural conditions fail for multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates. These two aspects have posed significant challenges and left the problem unresolved for years. On one hand, since \cite{LX}, the study of the entropy wave has been based on the left-right structural conditions. Without these structural conditions, the decay rates of lower-order terms become too slow to close the {\it a priori} assumption. On the other hand, the presence of diffusion waves yields problematic error terms in the perturbation system. In this work, we introduce a new transformation to ensure that both left-right structural conditions hold for the perturbation system. Additionally, using the fact that the derivative of the entropy wave maintains a fixed sign, we employ well-designed weighted energy estimates to control the slowly decaying terms. This enables us to establish asymptotic stability and derive the optimal decay rate. Furthermore, we address the case of initial perturbations with the zero mass condition and obtain the optimal decay rate by additionally developing a Poincar\'e type inequality and a key cancellation.</description>

      <title>On Moffatt's magnetic relaxation for 2D and 2.5D flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Moffatt's magnetic relaxation equation with Darcy-type regularization for the constitutive law. This is a topology-preserving dissipative equation, whose solutions are conjectured to converge in the infinite time limit towards equilibria of the incompressible Euler equations. Our goal is to prove this conjectured property for various equilibria in various domains. The first result concerns a class of non-constant shear flows in a 2D periodic channel. In the second result, by adopting a geometric approach, we address a class of 2.5D equilibria in $\Omega\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ can be a periodic channel or any bounded domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a unified treatment of the local well-posedness for the wave kinetic equation in almost critical weighted $L^r$ spaces with $2 \leq r \leq \infty.$ The proof builds on ideas from our earlier works \cite{AmLe24, AmLemain25}. Our approach is based solely on kinetic tools, with no appeal to Fourier theory.</description>

      <title>Kinetic and mean-field modeling of muscular dystrophies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new class of models for assessing the cell dynamics characterising muscular dystrophies. The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-differential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle fibers and immune cells implicated in muscle inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach presented here has the potential to offer new insights into the balance between degeneration and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>A Green's function approach to linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations in divergence form and application to singular Abreu type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish local and global regularity estimates for linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations in divergence form via critical Lorentz space estimates for the Green's function of the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere operator and its gradient. These estimates hold under suitable conditions on the data and the convex Monge-Amp\`ere potential is assumed to have Hessian determinant bounded between two positive constants. As an application, we obtain the solvability in all dimensions of the second boundary value problem for a class of singular fourth-order Abreu type equations that arise from the approximation analysis of variational problems subject to convexity constraints.</description>

      <title>Singular limit for a class of nonlocal conservation laws via compensated compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal conservation laws modeling traffic flows, given by $ \partial_t u_\varepsilon + \partial_x(V(u_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon) u_\varepsilon) = 0$, with a rescaled convolution kernel $\gamma_\varepsilon(\cdot) := \varepsilon^{-1}\gamma(\cdot/\varepsilon)$. We establish the strong $\mathrm L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}$-convergence of weak solutions $u_\varepsilon$ toward the entropy-admissible solution of the corresponding local conservation law as the kernel $\gamma_\varepsilon$ concentrates to a Dirac delta distribution when $\varepsilon \searrow 0$. In contrast to previous literature, we obtain compactness of the family $\{u_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$ without relying on total variation bounds or Ole\u{\i}nik-type estimates. Instead, we establish $\mathrm L^2$-type bounds on its entropy production and use the theory of compensated compactness, assuming that the initial datum merely belongs to $\mathrm L^1\cap \mathrm L^\infty$. Our results are twofold. First, we establish the nonlocal-to-local limit for the piecewise constant kernel $\gamma(\cdot) := {1}_{[-1,0]}(\cdot)$ combined with the affine velocity function from Greenshields' traffic model. Second, we prove the limit for strictly monotone kernels along with decreasing velocity functions. These results settle a long-standing open problem concerning the nonlocal-to-local convergence for non-convex kernels.</description>

      <title>Spatial scale separation and emergent patterns in coupled diffusive-nondiffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems with both diffusive and nondiffusive components, establishing the existence of far-from-equilibrium patterns and providing necessary and sufficient conditions for diffusion-driven instability (DDI). In particular, we prove the existence of far-from-equilibrium patterns exhibiting branch-switching and discontinuities in the nondiffusive components, which cannot occur in classical reaction-diffusion equations. While previous work has linked DDI to instability in the purely nondiffusive subsystem -- thereby destabilizing all regular Turing patterns -- we show that DDI can also arise from subsystems involving nondiffusive and slow-diffusive components. This leads to simple sufficient conditions for DDI in systems with arbitrary numbers of components. Further, we fully classify all possible sources of DDI in the case of two diffusive and one nondiffusive component, illustrating our results with a receptor-based model supported by numerical bifurcation analysis and simulations. These findings extend the theoretical foundations of pattern formation, demonstrating how coupling between diffusive and nondiffusive dynamics can generate patterns beyond the reach of the classical reaction-diffusion framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions for the nonlinear scalar field equation $$-\Delta u - \frac{(N-2)^2}{4|x|^2} u = g(u), \quad \mbox{in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\},$$ where the potential $-\frac{(N-2)^2}{4|x|^2}$ is the critical Hardy potential and $N \geq 3$. The nonlinearity $g$ is continuous and satisfies general subcritical growth assumptions of the Berestycki-Lions type. The problem is approached using variational methods within a non-standard functional setting. The natural energy functional associated with the equation is defined on the space $X^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$, which is the completion of $H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with respect to the norm induced by the quadratic part of the functional. We establish the existence of a nontrivial solution $u_0 \in X^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ that satisfies the Poho\v{z}aev constraint $\mathcal{M}$ and minimizes the energy functional on $\mathcal{M}$. Furthermore, assuming $g$ is odd, we prove the existence of at least one non-radial solution.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of the JKO Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $\eta&gt;0$ a sequence of probability distributions $\rho_k^\eta$ that approximate to first order in $\eta$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $\lambda$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $\eta$. We show that $\rho_k^\eta$ are approximated to order $\eta^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \emph{modified} energy \[ J^{\eta}(\rho) = J(\rho) - \frac{\eta}{4}\int_M \Big\lVert \nabla_g \frac{\delta J}{\delta \rho} (\rho) \Big\rVert_{2}^{2} \,\rho(dx), \] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $\eta/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $\eta$ a \textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{\"a}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^\eta$ we study \emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^\eta$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling limit behavior of a family of conservative SPDEs as the fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki dynamics. Precisely, we show that there exists a sequence of the one-dimensional rescaled fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki equation converges to the solution of the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation. This solves a simple version of the conjecture concerning the nonlinear fluctuation phenomenon, proposed by [Giacomin, Lebowitz, Presutti; Math. Surveys Monogr., 1999]. Furthermore, we prove a multi-scale dynamical large deviations in a small noise regime. Finally, we show the $\Gamma$-convergence of the rate function for the rescaled fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki equation to the rate function of the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the high-frequency Helmholtz equation using semiclassical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the numerical solution of high-frequency scattering problems modeled by the Helmholtz equation with a bounded obstacle. Although the analysis of this problem dates back at least 50 years, over the past decade or so, tools and techniques from $\textit{semiclassical analysis}$ have provided a new perspective and been used to settle several long-standing open problems in this area. Semiclassical analysis works in phase space (i.e., position and frequency) and describes rigorously the extent to which solutions of high-frequency PDEs are dictated by the properties of the corresponding geometric-optic rays.
  The goals of the article are to (i) give a introduction to semiclassical analysis aimed at non-experts and (ii) showcase some of the numerical-analysis results about finite-element methods, boundary-element methods, and domain-decomposition methods obtained using semiclassical techniques.</description>

Abstract: We consider the rescaled flow associated with a mean curvature flow that develops a compact singularity of multiplicity one. We prove that the ``decay order'' of such a rescaled flow is uniformly bounded. As a consequence, we prove a unique continuation result.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Route to Isoperimetric Inequalities via Heat Flow and Entropy Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic approach to isoperimetric inequalities based on entropy dissipation under heat flow. By viewing diffusion as a noisy information channel, we measure how mutual information about set membership decays over time. This decay rate is shown to be determined by the boundary measure of the set, leading to a new proof of the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality with its sharp constant. The method extends to Riemannian manifolds satisfying curvature-dimension conditions, yielding Levy-Gromov and Gaussian isoperimetric results within a single analytic principle. Quantitative and stability bounds follow from refined entropy inequalities linking information loss to geometric rigidity. The approach connects geometric analysis and information theory, revealing how entropy dissipation encodes the geometry of diffusion and boundary.</description>

      <title>Optimal Neumann boundary and distributed control of the Westervelt equation with time-fractional attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control of nonlinear acoustic waves is relevant in many medical ultrasound technologies, ranging from cancer therapy to targeted drug delivery, where it can help guide the precise deposition of acoustic energy. In this work, we study Neumann boundary and distributed control problems for tracking a prescribed pressure field governed by the Westervelt equation with time-fractional dissipation. This model captures nonlinear ultrasonic wave propagation in biological media and accounts for the experimentally observed power-law attenuation. We begin by extending the existing well-posedness theory for time-fractional equations to include inhomogeneous Neumann boundary data used as control inputs, which requires constructing an appropriate data extension and regularization. Using these analytical results for the forward problem, we prove the existence of globally optimal controls and analyze the stability of the optimization problem with respect to perturbations in the target pressure field and to vanishing regularization parameters. Finally, we investigate the associated adjoint equation, which has state-dependent coefficients, and use it to derive first-order necessary optimality conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several concepts of generalized differentiation in Wasserstein space have been proposed in order to deal with the intrinsic nonsmoothness arising in the context of optimization problems in Wasserstein spaces. In this paper we introduce a concept of admissible variation encompassing some of the most popular definitions as special cases, and using it to derive a comparison principle for viscosity solutions of an Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation following from an optimal control of a multiagent systems.</description>

      <title>A Critical Drift-Diffusion Equation: Intermittent Behavior via Geometric Brownian Motion on $ \textbf{SL}(n)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the so-called diffusion in the curl of the 2d Gaussian free field, and its generalization to higher dimensions $n \geq 2$, building on the scale-by-scale homogenization approach developed recently by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang [13]. It begins by reformulating the approximation scheme of that work in terms of SDEs in the length scale $L$. This exposes an unexpected connection with a certain geometric Brownian motion on the special linear group $\textbf{SL}(n)$. The analysis of this process sheds light on the original problem, particularly as it pertains to intermittent behavior exhibited by the (averaged) Lagrangian coordinate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a branched transport problem with weakly imposed boundary conditions. This problem arises as a reduced model for pattern formation in type-I superconductors. For this model, it is conjectured that the dimension of the boundary measure is non-integer. We prove this conjecture in a simplified 2D setting, under the (strong) assumption of Ahlfors regularity of the irrigated measure. This work is the first rigorous proof of a singular behaviour for irrigated measures resulting from minimality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the inverse problem for determining an unknown time-dependent source coefficient in a semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation with variable coefficients and Neumann boundary condition. This unknown source term is recovered from the integral measurement over the domain $\Omega$. Based on Rothe's method, the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution, under suitable assumptions on the data, is established. A numerical time-discrete scheme for the unique weak solution and the unknown source coefficient is designed, and the convergence of the approximations is proven. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical results. Noisy data is handled through polynomial regularisation.</description>

      <title>Weighted Orlicz-Sobolev and variable exponent Morrey regularity for fully nonlinear parabolic PDEs with oblique boundary conditions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we establish global weighted Orlicz-Sobolev and variable exponent Morrey-Sobolev estimates for viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear parabolic equations subject to oblique boundary conditions on a portion of the boundary, within the following framework: \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{rclcl} F(D^2u,Du,u,x,t) - u_{t} &amp;=&amp; f(x,t) &amp; \text{in} &amp; \Omega_{\mathrm{T}}, \\ \beta \cdot Du + \gamma u &amp;=&amp; g(x,t) &amp; \text{on} &amp; \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{T}}, \\ u(x, 0) &amp;=&amp; 0 &amp; \text{on} &amp; \Omega_{0}, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*}
  where \(\Omega_{\mathrm{T}} = \Omega \times (0,\mathrm{T})\) denotes the parabolic cylinder with spatial base \(\Omega\) (a bounded domain in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), \(n \geq 2\)) and temporal height \(\mathrm{T} &gt; 0\), \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{T}} = \partial \Omega \times (0,\mathrm{T})\), and \(\Omega_{0} = \Omega \times \{0\}\). Additionally, \(f\) represents the source term of the parabolic equation, while the boundary data are given by \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), and \(g\). Our first main result is a global weighted Orlicz-Sobolev estimate for the solution, obtained under asymptotic structural conditions on the differential operator and appropriate assumptions on the boundary data, assuming that the source term belongs to the corresponding weighted Orlicz space. Leveraging these estimates, we demonstrate several applications, including a density result within the fundamental class of parabolic equations, regularity results for the related obstacle problem, and weighted Orlicz-BMO estimates for both the Hessian and the time derivative of the solution. Lastly, we derive variable exponent Morrey-Sobolev estimates for the problem via an extrapolation technique, which are of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <title>On the weak flocking of the kinetic Cucker-Smale model in a fully non-compact support setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergent behaviors of the weak solutions to the kinetic Cucker-Smale (in short, KCS) model in a non-compact spatial-velocity support setting. Unlike the compact support situation, non-compact support of a weak solution can cause a communication weight to have zero lower bounds, and position difference does not have a uniformly linear growth bound. These cause the previous approach based on the nonlinear functional approach for spatial and velocity diameters to break down. To overcome these difficulties, we derive refined estimates on the upper bounds for the second-order spatial-velocity moments and show the uniqueness of the weak solution using the estimate on the deviation of particle trajectories. For the estimate of emergent dynamics, we consider two classes of distribution functions with decaying properties (an exponential decay or polynomial decay) in phase space, and then verify that the second moment for the velocity deviation from an average velocity tends to zero asymptotically, while the second moment for spatial deviation from the center of mass remains bounded uniformly in time. This illustrates the robustness of the mono-cluster flocking dynamics of the KCS model even for fully non-compact support settings in phase space and generalizes earlier results on flocking dynamics in a compact support setting.</description>

      <title>The effect of linear stratification on the stability of a rest state in the 2D inviscid Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate and quantify the effect of stratification on the stability time of a stably stratified rest state for the 2D inviscid Boussinesq system on $\mathbb{R}^2$. As an important consequence, we obtain stability of the steady state starting from an $\varepsilon$-sized initial perturbation of Sobolev regularity $H^{3^+}$ on a timescale $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4/3})$.
  In our setting, stratification induces dispersion and at the core of our approach are inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates used to control nonlinear contributions. This allows to keep only $L^2-$based regularity assumptions on the initial perturbation, whereas previous works impose additional localizations to achieve this timescale.
  We prove the analogous result for the related dispersive SQG equation.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we prove the existence of a positive and essentially bounded solution to a Lichnerowicz equation in the Einstein-scalar field theory on a closed manifold with non-constant mean curvature. In particular, the non-constant mean curvature gives rise to supercritical terms in the equation, on top of singular ones. We employ a recent fixed-point argument, which involves sub- and supersolutions. Additionally, we provide several conditions on the coefficients in the equation that prevent the existence of positive classical solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators are constructed on $p$-adic analytic manifolds using charts and transition maps from an atlas with connected nerve complex. In the compact case, an operator of Vladimirov-Taibleson type parametrised by a real parameter $s$ is defined. Its kernel function uses a geodetic-like distance function on the nerve complex of its atlas. The $L^2$-spectrum of this operator is established, and it is shown that it gives rise to a Feller semigroup. In this way, the Cauchy problem for the corresponding heat equation is solved in the positive by a transition function of a Markov process. The existence of a heat kernel function and a Green function in the case $s &gt; 1$ is proven. As an application, it is shown how to express the number of points on the reduction curve defined over the residue field of an elliptic curve with good reduction in terms of the eigenvalues of a Vladimirov-Taibleson-like operator. This provides for an alternative way of counting points on elliptic curves defined over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Observable sets for the free Schr\"odinger equation on combinatorial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study observability for the free Schr\"odinger equation $\partial_t u = i\Delta u$ on combinatorial graphs $G=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$. A subset $E\subset\mathcal{V}$ is observable at time $T&gt;0$ if there exists $C(T,E)&gt;0$ such that for all $u_0\in l^2(\mathcal{V})$, $$ \|u_0\|_{l^2(\mathcal{V})}^2 \le C(T,E)\int_0^T \|e^{it\Delta}u_0\|_{l^2(E)}^2\,\d t. $$
  On the one-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}$, we obtain a sharp threshold for thick sets: if $E\subset\mathbb{Z}$ is $\gamma$-thick with $\gamma\geq1/2$, then $E$ is observable at some time; conversely, for every $\gamma&lt;1/2$ there exists a $\gamma$-thick set that is not observable at any time. This critical threshold marks the exact point where the discrete lattice departs from the real line: on the lattice it must be attained, whereas on $\R$ any $\gamma$-thick set with $\gamma&gt;0$ already suffices.
  On $\mathbb{Z}^d$ we show that the complements of finite sets are observable at any time $T&gt;0$. This parallels the Euclidean setting $\R^d$: any set that contains the exterior of a finite ball is observable at any time.
  For finite graphs we give an equivalent characterization of observability in terms of the zero sets of Laplacian eigenfunctions. As an application, we construct unobservable sets of large density on discrete tori, in contrast with the continuous torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, where every nonempty open set is observable.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Adjoint-Optimized Neural PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks, which requires solving the inverse problem of learning neural network terms from observed data in order to approximate missing or unresolved physics in the PDE model. The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to the available ground truth data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent optimization method for training neural PDE models in the limit where both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to (i) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (ii) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem in the neural network function even in the infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neural network training cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit). The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem associated with the stochastic hyperbolic Keller-Segel (SHKS) equation featuring multiplicative noises on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. First, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of pathwise solutions to the SHKS equation within Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T}^d)$ for $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}+1$, under appropriate regularity conditions imposed on the nonlinear multiplicative noises. Subsequently, we explore two global results pertaining to noise-induced regularization: (1) The first result demonstrates that for polynomial-type nonlinear noises, when the noise intensity parameters meet specific threshold conditions, the SHKS equation possesses a unique pathwise solution for large initial data with probability one. This finding provides a partial answer to a question that has remained unresolved in the deterministic setting; (2) The second result reveals that, for small initial data, or equivalently when dealing with linear multiplicative noises with sufficiently large intensity (allowed to be negative), the SHKS equation admits a unique pathwise solution with high probability.</description>
