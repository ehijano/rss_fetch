      <title>Primordial Origin of Methane on Eris and Makemake Supported by D/H Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is a key tracer of the formation of the Solar System. Recent JWST observations have expanded the dataset of D/H ratios in methane on the KBOs Eris and Makemake, providing new insights into their origins. This study examines the elevated D/H ratios in methane on these KBOs in the context of protosolar nebula dynamics and chemistry, and proposes a primordial origin for the methane, in contrast to previous hypotheses suggesting abiotic production by internal heating. A time-dependent disk model coupled with a deuterium chemistry module was used to simulate the isotopic exchange between methane and hydrogen. Observational constraints, including the D/H ratio measured in methane in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, were used to refine the primordial D/H abundance. The simulations show that the observed D/H ratios in methane on Eris and Makemake are consistent with a primordial origin. The results suggest that methane on these KBOs likely originates from the protosolar nebula, similar to cometary methane, and was sequestered in solid form -- either as pure condensates or clathrates -- within their building blocks prior to accretion. These results provide a { simple} explanation for the high D/H ratios in methane on Eris and Makemake, without the need to invoke internal production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Moderate Albedo from Reflecting Aerosols on the Dayside of WASP-80 b Revealed by JWST/NIRISS Eclipse Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary eclipse observations of exoplanets at near-infrared wavelengths enable the detection of thermal emission and reflected stellar light, providing insights into the thermal structure and aerosol composition of their atmospheres. These properties are intertwined, as aerosols influence the energy budget of the planet. WASP-80 b is a warm gas giant with an equilibrium temperature of 825 K orbiting a bright late-K/early-M dwarf, and for which the presence of aerosols in its atmosphere have been suggested from previous HST and Spitzer observations. We present an eclipse spectrum of WASP-80 b obtained with JWST NIRISS/SOSS, spanning 0.68 to 2.83 $\mu$m, which includes the first eclipse measurements below 1.1 $\mu$m for this exoplanet, extending our ability to probe light reflected by its atmosphere. When a reflected light geometric albedo is included in the atmospheric retrieval, our eclipse spectrum is best explained by a reflected light contribution of $\sim$30 ppm at short wavelengths, although further observations are needed to statistically confirm this preference. We measure a dayside brightness temperature of $T_{\rm B}=811_{-70}^{+69}$ K and constrain the reflected light geometric albedo across the SOSS wavelength range to $A_{\rm g}=0.204_{-0.056}^{+0.051}$, allowing us to estimate a 1-$\sigma$ range for the Bond albedo of $0.148\lesssim A_{\rm B}\lesssim0.383$. By comparing our spectrum with aerosol models, we find that manganese sulfide and silicate clouds are disfavored, while cloud species with weak-to-moderate near-infrared reflectance, along with soots or low formation-rate tholin hazes, are consistent with our eclipse spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Role of Planetary-Scale Waves on the Stratospheric Superrotation in Titan's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze simulation results from the TitanWRF global circulation model to understand the mechanisms that maintain the equatorial superrotation in Titan's stratosphere. We find that the eddies associated with wave activities can transport angular momentum upgradient to zonal flow, leading to acceleration of the equatorial superrotation. The dominant wave modes identified in this study are consistent with previous studies, with zonal wavenumber 1 being the major contributor to the prograde acceleration. Despite the same conclusion of maintenance of equatorial superrotation via wave-mean interactions, we find that the way waves interact with the zonal flow in TitanWRF is slightly different from some other studies. We confirm our previous findings that in TitanWRF this occurs primarily during a dozen or so annual, short-duration (a few Titan sols) angular momentum "transfer events," which have a repeatable seasonal pattern but differ slightly in timing and magnitude between years. This is not the case in the Titan Atmosphere Model (TAM), which found milder angular momentum transfers that produced the strongest acceleration of superrotation around solstice in the upper stratosphere and more continuous year-around acceleration in the lower stratosphere. Despite differences in angular momentum transfer across models, we further find that, similar to the TAM wave analysis results, eddies generated by Rossby-Kelvin instabilities may be the major source of prograde angular momentum for the equatorial superrotation, although TitanWRF may also include contributions from the absorption of vertically propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. This differs from our previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for TitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.</description>

      <title>The Ambiguous Age and Tidal History for the Ultra-Hot Jupiter TOI-1937Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period (USP) planets are a rare but dynamically significant subset of the exoplanet sample, and understanding their dynamical histories and migration processes is necessary to build a complete picture of the outcomes of planet formation. In this work, we present an analysis of system age constraints and the impact of tidal evolution in the TOI-1937A system, a component of a large-separation stellar binary with an ambiguous age constraint that hosts a massive (&gt; 2 $M_{Jup}$) USP planetary companion. Through a suite of tidal evolution simulations and analysis of the transit timing variations present in the photometric data, we find that the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1937Ab is likely undergoing orbital decay driven by tidal interactions, and we place an observational upper limit on its decay rate of |$\dot{P}$| &lt; 0.09. We consider three different hypotheses for the system age based on three distinct methods of age estimation. These three age limits are complemented by indirect evidence of the age of the star that comes from our dynamical and transit timing analyses. We discuss the possibility that future data will provide more concrete constraints on the tidal parameters of TOI-1937Ab and its host star.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from \ce{CO2} or \ce{CO} and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in \ce{PO} and \ce{CO2}, various alternative compositions, including \ce{H2O}-,\ce{CO}-, \ce{PH3}-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>

      <title>A multi-model approach using XAI and anomaly detection to predict asteroid hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions. Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Prediction and observation of a stellar occultation by Haumea's satellite Namaka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar occultations are an ideal way to characterize the physical and orbital properties of trans-Neptunian binary systems. In this research note, we detail the prediction and observation of a stellar occultation observed with NASA's IRTF on March 16$^{\mathrm{th}}$, 2025 (UT), with drop-outs from both the dwarf planet Haumea and its smaller satellite Namaka. This occultation places a lower limit of 83 $\pm$ 2 km on Namaka's diameter. We also discuss the possibility that this detection could help to constrain the orbit of Namaka, measure Haumea's gravitational harmonics, and provide a path to measuring the internal structure of Haumea.</description>

      <title>Towards a definition of a meteor cluster: Detection of meteor clusters from meteor orbit databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of today, there is no official definition of a meteor cluster. It is usually identified as a large number of meteors sharing a similar radiant and velocity, all occurring within a few seconds. Only eight clusters have been reported so far, from single-camera or camera network observations. We aim to provide an overview of meteor clusters to help define what constitutes a cluster by potentially adding more to the already identified ones and determining their common parameters. A search for new clusters is performed in publicly available International Astronomical Union meteor databases with the DBSCAN algorithm. Then, a statistical significance method is applied to derive the most promising cluster candidates. However, the method still lacks a way to debias the atmospheric area surveyed by the cameras due to a lack of publicly available data. A set of 16 statistically significant potential clusters is identified, involving 4 to 7 fragments. The 90th percentile includes a duration of 8 seconds, a velocity difference of 2.2 km/s, and a radiant spread of nearly 4 degrees. The velocity difference may arise from the method used for orbit computation. Meteor clusters might be more frequent than currently reported. However, we recommend that future meteor orbit databases also include a way to estimate the surveyed area by the cameras involved in the detection. This would strengthen the veracity of the 16 identified cluster candidates and ultimately allow scientists to fully debias the number of clusters, and hence derive the physical lifetime expectancy of meteoroids, which is often overlooked due to the focus on collisional lifetime estimates only. We also recommend that any future cluster observation report includes the expected number of random occurrences and consider the event to be real if this value is below 0.1.</description>

      <title>The role of absorption and scattering in shaping ice bands. Spatially-resolved spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope now enables the spectral study of ices with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. Water ice plays a crucial role in the growth of grains and in planetary formation but its spatial distribution in protoplanetary disks is poorly constrained. To help the interpretation of future observations, we study here for the first time how the water ice band depends on the observer's perspective and the location where spectra are measured within protoplanetary disks. Based on a standard protoplanetary disk model around a T Tauri star, we used the radiative transfer code MCFOST to extract water-ice spectra and to measure the depth and central wavelength of the water-ice band at different locations in the disk. Even in the context of a spatially homogeneous ice mixture, the observed properties of water-ice bands depend on the inclination of the system as well as on the location in the disk from which the spectra are extracted. In particular, the wavelength of the band minimum can change by up to 0.17 {\mu}m comparable to the difference expected between amorphous and crystalline ices, for instance. This phenomenon stems from a balance between absorption and scattering and must be taken into account in detailed modeling of spatially-resolved infrared spectroscopy of ices, including CO and CO2.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary cores drove chondrule formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chondrules are small spherical objects that formed at high temperatures early in the history of the Solar System. The key compositional characteristics of chondrules may be well explained by high gas pressures in their formation environment (Galy et al. 2000; Alexander et al. 2008). However, such high gas pressures are widely considered astrophysically unreasonable (Ebel et al. 2023). Here, we propose that chondrules were formed via the processing of dust grains in the dust-rich envelopes of planetary embryos, before getting ejected via convective diffusion. We show that this scenario can explain many salient constraints on chondrule formation, including formation locations; mass and timescale of chondrule production; repeat chondrule heating events; heating timescales; and, most crucially, high prevailing gas pressures. Our work suggests that high gas pressures may indeed have prevailed during the formation of chondrules, reconciling previous analytical observations, experimental evidence, and theory. We suggest that chondrules are mostly the products rather than the precursors of planetary embryo formation - a result which would have important implications for our understanding of the early history of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>A Homogeneous Catalog of Oscillating Solar-Type Stars Observed by the Kepler Mission and a New Amplitude Scaling Relation Including Chromospheric Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous catalog of global asteroseismic parameters and derived stellar parameters for 765 Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars. The catalog was produced by re-analyzing all available Kepler DR25 short-cadence data using pySYD, an automated pipeline to extract global asteroseismic parameters. We find 50 new detections, seven of which are also planet candidate host stars. We find excellent agreement between our $\nu_{\text{max}}$ and $\Delta \nu$ measurements and literature values, with an average offset of $0.2 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=5\%$) and $0.2 \pm 0.7\%$ ($\sigma=2\%$), respectively. In addition, we derive stellar radii and masses with an average precision of $2.7\%$ and $10.4\%$, respectively, and find a median offset of $0.4 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=10\%$) between our radii derived with asteroseismology and those from Gaia parallaxes. Using spectroscopic $\log{R'_{\text{HK}}}$ activity measurements from Keck/HIRES, we derive a new amplitude scaling relation with an activity term for main-sequence and subgiant stars, which reduces the offset between expected and observed oscillation amplitudes from $9.3 \pm 1.6\%$ to $1.7 \pm 0.9\%$. Our work is the largest and most homogeneous asteroseismic catalog of Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars to date, including a total of 101 stars hosting planet candidates and 451 stars with measured rotation periods.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth rotates through the axisymmetric part of its own magnetic field, but a simple proof shows that it is impossible to use this to generate electricity in a conductor rotating with Earth.However, we previously identified implicit assumptions underlying this proof and showed theoretically that these could be violated and the proof circumvented. This requires using a soft magnetic material with a topology satisfying a particular mathematical condition and a composition and scale favoring magnetic diffusion, i.e. having a low magnetic Reynolds number Rm (C.F. Chyba, K.P. Hand, Electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field. Phys. Rev. Applied 6, 014017-1-18 (2016)). Here we realize these requirements with a cylindrical shell of manganese-zinc ferrite. Controlling for thermoelectric and other potentially confounding effects (including 60 Hz and RF background), we show that this small demonstration system generates a continuous DC voltage and current of the (low) predicted magnitude. We test and verify other predictions of the theory: voltage and current peak when the cylindrical shell's long axis is orthogonal to both Earth's rotational velocity v and magnetic field; voltage and current go to zero when the entire apparatus (cylindrical shell together with current leads and multimeters) is rotated 90 degrees to orient the shell parallel to v; voltage and current again reach a maximum but of opposite sign when the apparatus is rotated a further 90 degrees; an otherwise-identical solid MnZn cylinder generates zero voltage at all orientations; and a highRm cylindrical shell produces zero voltage. We also reproduce the effect at a second experimental location. The purpose of these experiments was to test the existence of the predicted effect. Ways in which this effect might be scaled to generate higher voltage and current may now be investigated.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the SATIRE-S irradiance reconstruction: Heritage of Mt Wilson magnetograms and Ca II K observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate information on long-term variations in solar irradiance, important for understanding the solar influence on Earth's climate, cannot be derived from direct irradiance measurements due to the comparatively short lifetimes of space-borne experiments. Models using measurements of the solar photospheric magnetic field as input can provide an independent assessment of the changes. The SATIRE-S model does just that. Unfortunately, the magnetogram archives used by SATIRE-S to recover irradiance variations are also relatively short-lived and have short mutual overlapping periods, making it difficult to evaluate their consistency. We improve SATIRE-S total solar irradiance (TSI) reconstruction by firstly incorporating magnetograms from the Mt Wilson Observatory as well as unsigned magnetograms reconstructed from Meudon, Rome, and San Fernando Ca II K data, and secondly, by re-analysing all periods of overlaps between the various archives. Our combined daily irradiance reconstruction from all eight input archives returns an excellent agreement with direct measurements of irradiance, in particular we find a correlation coefficient of 0.98 when comparing to TSIS1/TIM (Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor Total Irradiance Monitor) data. The minimum-to-minimum TSI difference between 1976 and 2019 is -0.2$\pm0.17$~Wm$^{-2}$, while the TSI difference between the 1986 and 2019 minima is statistically insignificant (-0.06$\pm0.13$~Wm$^{-2}$). Our analysis also sheds light on the trend shown by the TSI over the so-called ACRIM gap, disfavouring a hypothesised increasing trend in TSI in that period. By including more direct and indirect magnetogram time series, we have made the TSI reconstructed by SATIRE-S more robust and accurate. The new series shows a reduced trend of decreasing TSI over the last half century, which agrees well with most composites of measured TSI.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of exoplanets in face-on orbits using vortex filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to detect exoplanets based on their host star's intensity centroid after it passes thru a vortex filter. Based on our calculations with planets in face-on orbits, exoplanets with relative proximity to their host stars and with low mass ratios ($m_p/m_s$) can have discernible signals that can be amplified by the topological charge $\ell$ of the vortex filter. For exoplanets that have higher mass ratios and are far from their host stars, a clear signal can also be obtained but these are not affected by the value of $\ell$ and other planet detection methods may be more suitable. We present a simple table-top optical experiment to support our calculations. Our proposed method adds to the arsenal of techniques for astrometric exoplanet detection.</description>

      <title>Population-level Hypothesis Testing with Rocky Planet Emission Data: A Tentative Trend in the Brightness Temperatures of M-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres, and why, is a key goal for JWST. So far, emission observations of individual rocky exoplanets orbiting M stars (M-Earths) have not provided definitive evidence for atmospheres. Here, we synthesize emission data for M-Earths and find a trend in measured brightness temperatures (ratioed to its theoretical maximum value) as a function of instellation. However, the statistical evidence of this trend is dependent on the choice of stellar model and we consider its identification tentative. We show that this trend can be explained by either the onset of thin/tenuous (&lt;1 bar) CO2-rich atmospheres on colder worlds, or a population of bare rocks with stronger space weathering and/or coarser regolith on closer-in worlds. Such grain coarsening may be caused by sintering near the melting point of rock or frequent volcanic resurfacing. Furthermore, we highlight considerations when testing rocky planet hypotheses at the population level, including the choice of instrument, stellar modeling, and how brightness temperatures are derived. We also find that fresh (unweathered) fine-grained surfaces can serve as a false positive to the detection of moderate atmospheric heat redistribution through eclipse observations. However, we argue that such surfaces are unlikely given the ubiquity of space weathering in the Solar System, the low albedo of Solar System airless bodies, and the high stellar wind environments of M-Earths. Emission data from a larger sample of M-Earths will be able to confirm or reject this tentative trend and diagnose its cause through spectral characterization.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Stellar Flares on the Atmospheric Escape of Exoplanets orbiting M stars I: Insights from the AU Mic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-rays and Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) emission from M stars can drive the atmospheric escape on planets orbiting them. M stars are also known for their frequent emission of stellar flares, which will increase the high-energy flux received by their orbiting planets. To understand how stellar flares impact the primordial atmospheres of planets orbiting young M stars, we use UV spectroscopic data of flares from the Habitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time (HAZMAT) and Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) programs as a proxy to the XUV flare emission. Using the software package VPLanet, we simulate the young AU Mic planetary system composed of two Neptune-sized and one Earth-sized planet orbiting a 23-Myr-old M1 star. Our findings show that the Earth-sized planet AU Mic d should be in the process of losing completely its atmosphere in the next couple million years, solely due to the quiescent emission, with flares not significantly contributing to its atmospheric escape due to the small size of AU mic d and its close-in distance from the star. However, our results indicate that flares would play a crucial role for such planets further away, in the habitable zone (i.e. 0.2935 AU) of AU Mic-like stars during the post-saturation phase, accelerating the total atmospheric loss process by a few billion years. For planets between 0.365 AU and the HZ outer edge, the additional XUV from flares is necessary to deplete primordial atmospheres fully since the quiescent emission alone is insufficient.</description>

      <title>Bright Sungrazing Comets in a Great Historical Controversy and Prospects for Their Appearance in the Near Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Until the second half of the 19th century, two or more brief appearances of bright comets, such as the ones in 1668 and 1702, alike in aspect and motion, seen with a tail near the Sun, were almost universally believed to be periodic returns of a single object. It is likely that the exceptional story of Halley's comet was the compelling precedent for this school of thought. Application to sungrazers was discredited by the observed fragmentation of the nucleus of the giant sungrazer of 1882 shortly after perihelion. Generally, separations and orbital periods of the Kreutz comets are known to be governed in such events by the solar tidal force, while the range in the longitude of the nodal line is linked to the pyramidal architecture caused by nontidal, cascading fragmentation along the entire orbit and described by an updated contact-binary model. Perception of the sungrazer system was changed dramatically by coronagraphic imaging from space, which led to discovery of up to ten populations of dwarf comets. Past fragmentation patterns have been used to tentatively predict the arrivals of two bright Kreutz sungrazers -- a Population II member around 2027 (and before 2040) and a Population I member around 2050.</description>

      <title>How the CME on 21 April 2023 Triggered the First Severe Geomagnetic Storm of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first severe (G4) geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 25 occurred on 23-24 April 2023, following the arrival of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on 23 April. The characteristics of this CME, measured from coronagraphs (speed and mass), did not indicate that it would trigger such an intense geomagnetic storm. In this work, our aim is to understand why this CME led to such a geoeffective outcome. Our analysis spans from the source active region to the corona and inner heliosphere through 1 au using multiwavelength, multi-viewpoint remote sensing observations and in situ data. We find that rotation and possibly deflection of the CME resulted in an axial magnetic field nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane during the Earth encounter, which might explain the storm's severity. Additionally, we find that imaging away from the Sun-Earth line is crucial in hindcasting the CME Time-of-Arrival at Earth. The position (0.39 au) and detailed images from the SoloHI telescope onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, in combination with SOHO and STEREO images, helped decisively with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CME.</description>
