      <title>State-Selective Ionization and Trapping of Single H$_2^+$ Ions with (2+1) Multiphoton Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on efficient rovibrational state-selective loading of single H$_2^+$ molecular ions into a cryogenic linear Paul trap using (2+1) resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI). The H$_2^+$ ions are created by resonant two-photon excitation of H$_2$ molecules from the $X\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state to the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state, followed by non-resonant one-photon ionization. The H$_2^+$ ions are produced from residual gas and sympathetically cooled by a co-trapped, laser-cooled $^9$Be$^+$ ion. By tuning the wavelength of the REMPI laser, we observe the loading of single H$_2^+$ ions via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 0, 1, 2, 3$) rovibrational levels of the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ intermediate state. We measure the success probability for the production of H$_2^+$ in the ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 1$) state via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 1$) level to be 85(6)% by quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) of the hyperfine structure of this rovibrational state. Furthermore, we load an H$_2^+$ ion via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 2$) level and confirm its rovibrational state to be ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 2$) by QLS. We perform QLS probes on the ion over 19 h and observe no decay of the rotationally excited state. Our work demonstrates an efficient state-selective loading mechanism for single-ion, high-precision spectroscopy of hydrogen molecular ions.</description>

      <title>QED calculations of intra-$L$-shell doubly excited states in Be-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigorous QED approach is employed to calculate the energies of the $2p2p\,^3P_{0,1,2}$, $2p2p\,^1D_2$, and $2p2p\,^1S_0$ states of selected Be-like highly charged ions over a wide range of nuclear-charge numbers, $18 \leqslant Z \leqslant 92$. Combined with the previously reported energies of the $2s2p \, ^3P_{0,1,2}$ and $2s2p \, ^1P_1$ states [A. V. Malyshev et al., Phys. Rev. A 110, 062824 (2024)], the obtained results are used to study various intra-$L$-shell transition energies. Strong level mixing, caused by the proximity of states with the same symmetry, is overcome by means of the QED perturbation theory for quasi-degenerate levels. The applied approach merges a rigorous perturbative QED treatment up to the second order with the consideration of electron-electron correlation contributions of the third and higher orders evaluated within the Breit approximation. The higher-order screened QED effects are estimated using the model-QED-operator approach. The nuclear-recoil and nuclear-polarization effects are also taken into account. The obtained predictions represent the most accurate theoretical description of the electronic structure of Be-like ions to date and demonstrate good agreement with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Statistics of multi-electron states and $J$-levels in atomic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number and nature of atomic configurations are cornerstones of atomic spectroscopy, especially for the calculation of hot-plasma radiative properties. The knowledge of the distributions of magnetic quantum number $M$ and angular momentum $J$ for $N$ identical fermions in a subshell with half-integer spin $j$ is a prerequisite to the determination of the structure of such configurations. The problem is rather complicated, since the possible occurrence of a specific values of $J$ is governed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Several methods, such as generating functions, recurrence relations or algebraic number theory, for instance via Gaussian polynomials, have proven effective in addressing this issue. However, up to now, no general formula was known. In the present work, we present exact and compact explicit formulas for the number of atomic configurations and for the distributions of the total magnetic quantum number $M$ and angular momentum $J$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ytterbium-171 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{171}$Yb relevant to these applications. We emphasize experimental results and supplement these with theoretical estimates. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{171}$Yb (${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^1\mathrm{P}_1$, ${}^1\mathrm{S}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}\,$, ${}^3\mathrm{P}_{0,2}\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{S}_1$, and ${}^3\mathrm{P}_0\rightarrow{}^3\mathrm{D}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving fermionic $^{171}$Yb.</description>

      <title>A high-lying isomer in ^{92}Zr with lifetime modulated by the atomic charge states: a proposed approach for a nuclear gamma-ray laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclides ^{92}Zr are produced and transported by using a radioactive beam line to a lowbackground detection station. After a flight time of about 1.14 {\mu}s, the ions are implanted into a carbon foil, and four {\gamma} rays deexciting the 8+ state in ^{92}Zr are observed in coincidence with the implantation signals within a few nanoseconds. We conjecture that there exists an isomer located slightly above the 8^{+} state in ^{92}Zr. The isomeric lifetime in highly charged states is extended significantly due to the blocking of internal conversion decay channels, enabling its survival over the transportation. During the slowing-down process in the carbon foil, the ^{92}Zr ions capture electron and evolve toward neutral atoms, and consequently the lifetime is restored to a normal short value. Such a high-lying isomer depopulated by a low-energy transition may provide unique opportunity to develop nuclear {\gamma} laser.</description>

      <title>Coherent Two-State Oscillations in False Vacuum Decay Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent two-state oscillations are observed in numerical simulations of one-dimensional transverse- and longitudinal-field Ising model within the false vacuum decay regimes. Starting from the false vacuum state with all spins up, in moderate-sized systems with a small transverse field, we find conventional decay dynamics at resonance conditions $ h\approx 2J/n$ can change into coherent oscillations between the false vacuum and a symmetric resonant state, manifested by a sub-leading eigenstate overlap approaching $0.5$ and periodic vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. Notably, the oscillation frequency shows a superradiant-like $\sqrt{L}$ enhancement compared to the earlier Schrieffer-Wolff predictions. In larger systems, we find these oscillations persist for $n \gtrsim L/2$ (enabled by a bubble size blockade effect) or when long-range interactions lift multi-bubble degeneracies, revealing a robust many-body coherence mechanism transcending perturbative treatments and finite-size limitations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic magnetic field imaging with hot atoms via single-pixel imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, sensors based on hot atomic vapor cells have emerged as a compact and highly sensitive means of measuring magnetic fields. Such sensors have been deployed in the field for the measurement of, e.g. biological systems, representing a promising practical application of quantum technologies. However, it remains challenging to obtain high-resolution magnetic field images from these sensors, and in most cases the spatial resolution of the system is limited by the sensor size. Here, we demonstrate the combination of single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques with an atom vapor. Faraday magnetometer to achieve microscopic magnetic field imaging. We demonstrate magnetic field imaging with a spatial resolution of $\approx~62.5\mu m$, limited only by the resolution of our DMD projection system and the absence of magnetic shielding in our experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Observation of self-oscillating supersonic flow across an acoustic horizon in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics and stability of transonic flows in quantum fluids, especially for those beyond one spatial dimension, is an outstanding challenge, with applications ranging from nonlinear optics and condensed matter to analogue gravity. One intriguing possibility is that a system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, often lead to breakthroughs in the our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>Testing the Fifth Force on Lepton Spins through Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a fifth force mediated by a light vector boson that couples to lepton spins, characterized by axial-vector couplings to leptons and vector couplings to nucleons. This interaction generates a potential proportional to the inner product of the lepton spin vector and the nucleon-lepton relative velocity vector, a feature extensively explored with precision spin sensors. Employing weak symmetry, we show that left-handed charged lepton couplings naturally extend to left-handed neutrinos, enabling this fifth force to influence neutrino oscillations. For electron-nucleon couplings, we find that solar and reactor neutrino experiments provide comparable constraints to those from spin sensors and surpass them in the short-range fifth force region. For muon-nucleon couplings, neutrino oscillation experiments exclude the fifth force as a viable explanation for the muon $ g-2 $ anomaly in the context of a vector mediator, tightening the bounds by two orders of magnitude in coupling strength by solar and atmospheric neutrino data. Our results highlight the critical role of neutrino oscillations in probing fifth forces acting across all three generations of lepton spins.</description>
