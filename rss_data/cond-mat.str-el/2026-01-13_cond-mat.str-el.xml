      <title>Emergence of Kugel-Khomskii physics in quarter-filled bilayer correlated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the low-energy physics of a quarter-hole-filled two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model motivated by transition-metal bilayer systems with strong orbital-selective interlayer hybridization. By explicitly treating the strong interlayer bonding of dz2 orbitals within a molecular orbital basis and projecting out high-energy electronic states, we derive a low-energy effective Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian describing the interplay between electron spin and emergent layer pseudospin degrees of freedom. We map out a rich ground state phase diagram featuring diverse spin and charge ordered states. These include conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases with layer staggered charge densities, a layer-coherent phase characterized by spontaneous interlayer quantum coherence, and a novel maximally spin-layer-entangled phase with a hidden composite spin-layer order. We show that this exotic hidden ordered phase arises from the spontaneous breaking of an emergent O(4) symmetry down to a O(3), manifesting a unique excitation spectrum with three entangled gapless Goldstone modes. Our results uncover a geometrically driven mechanism for realizing composite entanglement in strongly correlated bilayer systems and provide a concrete theoretical framework relevant to bilayer nickelate superconductors and other multi-component correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in exactly solvable model: the Ising-Kondo lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet (AM), a recently identified class of collinear magnet, has garnered significant attention due to its unique combination of zero net magnetization and spin-split energy bands, leading to a variety of novel physical phenomena. Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Topological $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful numerical methods for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We extend DMRG to the case with the $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ symmetry with $N_c &gt; 2$, including two-dimensional systems. As a killer application, we simulate the ground state of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which can potentially be realised in cold atomic systems and solid state systems like $\alpha$-ZrCl$_3$. We keep up to 12800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ states equivalent to more than a million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states. This supermassive DMRG simulation reveals the quantum spin-orbital liquid ground state, which has been conjectured for more than a decade. The methodology developed here can be extended to any classical Lie groups, paving the way to a next-generation DMRG with a full symmetry implementation.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Insulator to Metal Transition in Non-Centrosymmetric Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance within the unit cell of bottom-up synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) represents a versatile tool for realizing custom-tailored quantum nanomaterials. The interaction between low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) not only contributes to frontier bands but can form the basis for magnetically ordered phases. Here, we present the bottom-up synthesis of a non-centrosymmetric GNR that places all ZMs on the majority sublattice sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal that strong electron-electron correlation drives the system into a ferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state featuring a sizeable band gap of Eg ~ 1.2 eV. At higher temperatures, a chemical transformation induces an insulator-to-metal transition that quenches the ferro-magnetic order. Tight-binding (TB) and first-principles density functional theory calculations corroborate our experimental observations. This work showcases how control over molecular symmetry, sublattice polarization, and ZM hybridization in bottom-up synthesized nanographenes can open a path to the exploration of many-body physics in rationally designed quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing altermagnetic Fermi surfaces with two Kondo impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the study of altermagnetism, or unconventional magnetism, and in the realization and manipulation of two-impurity Kondo physics in real materials, we propose a phase-sensitive method to explore unconventional magnetic symmetries. Our method can be implemented with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to study two-impurity Kondo phenomena on altermagnetic metals by varying the distance and orientation between magnetic impurities. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the spin splitting of the Kondo resonance, whose spatial distribution sensitively captures the symmetry of the underlying altermagnetic order. Furthermore, the impurity spin correlations reflects the anisotropy of the RKKY interaction due to the altermagnetic Fermi surface splitting. This work provides a framework for studying the competition between the Kondo effect, the RKKY interaction and altermagnetism, in the simplest possible system.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Charge and Magnetic Orders in SmNiC$_2$ Mediated by Electron-Phonon Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) instabilities and ferromagnetism in SmNiC$_2$ using diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering together with Raman spectroscopy. We identify a soft acoustic phonon driving the incommensurate CDW (I-CDW) and uncover a second Kohn anomaly at the wave vector of the commensurate CDW (C-CDW) stabilized in other $R$NiC$_2$ members ($R=$ rare earth). The marked softening of both phonons and their contrasting evolution with temperature reveal a competition between the two ordering tendencies. Alongside pronounced anomalies in the temperature dependence of the zone center and soft phonons, we observe the collective amplitude mode of the CDW, which collapses abruptly as ferromagnetism sets in. Surprisingly, the Kohn anomalies persist in the ferromagnetic state despite the degradation of Fermi-surface nesting conditions. Our experimental findings, supported by ab initio calculations, highlight the central role of the electron-phonon interaction in driving the CDW formation and tuning the balance between competing charge and magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnetic phase transitions and transport anomalies in GdAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials hosting non-zero Berry curvature have emerged as a focus of intensive research due to their exceptional magnetoelectric coupling phenomena and potential applications in next-generation spintronic devices. In this work, we successfully synthesized high-quality GdAlSi single crystals, a prototypical member of RAlX (R = rare earth elements; X = Si/Ge) family that has been theoretically predicted to sustain a non-trivial Weyl semimetal state. Through systematic investigations of magnetic and transport properties, we identified two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at critical temperatures TN1 31.9 K and TN2 31.1 K, as evidenced by temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. Notably, applied magnetic fields exceeding 8 T induce a third magnetic transition (TN3), generating a cascade of metamagnetic transitions that collectively form a dendritic phase diagram. This complex magnetic behavior is attributed to the interplay between localized Gd-4f moments and itinerant conduction electrons, possibly mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes. Our results not only establish GdAlSi as a rich platform for investigating correlated topological states, but also demonstrate its potential for engineering topological phase transitions through magnetic symmetry manipulation in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Role of Disorder in Governing the Magnetic Properties of Cu2IrO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is a honeycomb iridate which has been studied recently as a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Its magnetic ground state however, has been reported to be quantum disordered, spin glassy, or magnetically ordered depending on synthesis details. We have prepared a Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample with large antisite disorder and studied in detail its structure (global and local), charge states, and thermodynamic properties to try to quantify and characterize the disorder and its connection to the magnetic ground state. X-ray diffraction, Extended x-ray absorption fine structure(EXAFS) and X-ray pair distribution function analysis revealed a large site disorder ($\sim$25\%), while XPS and XANES reveal mixed valence of Cu and Ir following Cu$^{1+}$ + Ir$^{4+}$ $\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + Ir$^{3+}$. This combination of site disorder and charge redistribution generates competing antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic frustration, resulting in dynamically fluctuating AFM clusters near 80K that freeze below 29K. These results demonstrate the crucial role of synthesis dependent disorder in determining the magnetic ground state of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Sliding Charge Density Wave observed through Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An incommensurate CDW may have the ability to slide, i.e., to generate an excess of current when the system is submitted to an external field. Sliding phenomenon is closely related to deformation of the periodic lattice distortion associated to the CDW. In principle, however, the sliding state can also be observed through the band structure. Here we show that broken symmetry in k-space is observed by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) in the sliding regime of TbTe$_3$, which could be consistent with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Collinear $p$-wave magnetism and hidden orbital ferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, collinear magnets are classified as even-wave magnets, i.e., either ferro-, antiferro-, or altermagnets. It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders and excitations in a half-filled Hubbard model that continuously interpolates between the Lieb and kagome lattices. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Machine learning nonequilibrium phase transitions in charge-density wave insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Anderson-type lower bounds on the ground-state energy of the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct rigorous Anderson-type lower bounds on the ground-state energy of the spin-$S$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice. By formulating and optimizing a hierarchy of local cluster motifs ordered by size, we generate a sequence of increasingly tight bounds. A seven-site "hourglass" cluster composed of two corner-sharing tetrahedra furnishes an optimal lower bound that admits a closed-form expression for arbitrary spin $S$. We also derive exact lower bounds for generalized models with further-neighbor exchange, ring exchange, and scalar spin-chirality interactions. For $S=1/2$ and $S=1$, numerical optimization of an 18-site "crown" cluster containing a hexagonal loop yields rigorous lower bounds on the ground-state energy per site of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model with unit exchange, $e_\mathrm{GS} \geq -0.549832$ and $e_\mathrm{GS} \geq -1.632985$, respectively. We compare the resulting bounds with numerical ground-state energy estimates from the literature.</description>

      <title>Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality in critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${\mu_0H_c} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with ${\beta} + {\gamma} \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.</description>

Abstract: Interfaces in three-dimensional many-body systems can exhibit rich phenomena beyond the corresponding bulk properties. In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Topological phonons in anomalous Hall crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on few-layer graphene structures have reported indirect signatures of anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs), but the need for a top gate to stabilize the phase precludes direct imaging of the emergent electronic lattice. This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs.</description>

      <title>Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for dephasing of coupled systems: decoupling and IQP duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave in a correlated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) in a correlated regime, we employ the Green's functions formalism, as well as the Hubbard-I approximation, as a way to introduce the correlations into the problem, in the form of a repulsive Coulomb interaction $U$. In addition, we investigate the effects of second-nearest neighbor hopping $t_1$ on a pure CDW state. The analysis of the results show that, for small values of $t_1$, both CDW and superconducting gaps compete for the same region on the Fermi surface. The increase of $t_1$ decreases the competition and may lead the system to a coexistence regime. Effects of temperature in the coexistence regime, are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian qLDPC: TQFT Formalism, Addressable Gauging Measurement and Application to Magic State Fountain on 2D Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincar\'e CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Charged moir\'e phonons in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e phonons describe collective vibrations of a moir\'e superlattice produced by long-wavelength relative displacements of the constituent layers. Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moir\'e cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moir\'e materials at small twist angles.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Essentially No Energy Barrier Between Independent Fermionic Neural Quantum State Minima</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have proven highly effective in representing quantum many-body wavefunctions, but their loss landscape remains poorly understood and debated. Here, we demonstrate that the NQS loss landscape is more benign and similar to conventional deep learning than previously thought, exhibiting mode connectivity: independently trained NQS are connected by paths in parameter space with essentially no energy barrier. To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths. For the strongly interacting six-electron quantum dot modeled by a $1.6$M-parameter Psiformer, we find two independent minima with expected energy barrier $\sim10^{-5}$ times smaller than the system's overall energy scale and $\sim10^{-3}$ times smaller than the linear path's barrier. The path respects physical symmetry in addition to achieving low energy, with the angular momentum remaining well quantized throughout. Our work is the first to construct optimized paths between independently trained NQS, and it suggests that the NQS loss landscape may not be as pathological as once feared.</description>

Abstract: We present direct experimental evidence of a weakly coupled multiband superconducting state in the bilayer iron-based superconductor ACa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ (A = K, Cs) via ultrahigh-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Remarkably, the K-containing compound exhibits two distinct transition temperatures, corresponding to two separate sets of bilayer-split bands, as evidenced by temperature-dependent superconducting gap and spectral weight near the Fermi energy, while its Cs counterpart displays conventional single transition behavior. These experimental observations are well described by the weakly coupled two-band model of Eilenberger theory, which identifies suppressed interband pairing interactions between the bilayer-split bands as the key mechanism. By exploring quantum phenomena in the weak-coupling limit within a multiband system, our findings pave the way for engineering exotic superconductivity via band-selective pairing control.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable oxide nanoelectronics, enabled by conductive atomic force microscope (cAFM) lithography, have established complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for quantum engineering that harnesses emergent phenomena for advanced functionalities. However, this cAFM nanofabrication process can only occur in the air, with simultaneous device decay described under the "water-cycle" writing mechanism. These restrictions pose ongoing challenges for device optimization in the quantum regime at mK temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a "waterless" cAFM lithography approach that is compatible with vacuum and cryogenic environments. Through oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we have achieved nonvolatile and reconfigurable cAFM control of nanoscale interfacial polaron-electron liquid transition at mK temperatures with an ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm. Supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling, we show that tip-controlled oxygen vacancy electromigration plays a key role. This advancement bridges reconfigurable device fabrication and concurrent characterization in situ at mK temperatures, and establishes a versatile Hubbard toolbox for engineering programmable quantum phases in correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic anomalous Hall effect in distorted kagome GdTi3Bi4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological kagome magnets offer a rich landscape for exploring the intricate interplay of quantum interactions among geometry, topology, spin, and correlation. GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>From perovskite to infinite-layer nickelates: hole concentration from x-ray absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difficulty of determining cation concentrations and oxygen stoichiometry in infinite-layer nickelate thin films has so far prevented clear experimental identification of the nickel electron configuration in the superconducting phase. We used soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the successive changes in PrNiO$_x$ thin films at various intermediate stages of topotactic reduction with $x=2-3$. By comparing the Ni-$L$ edge spectra to single and double cluster ligand-field calculations, we find that none of our samples exhibit a pure $d^9$ configuration. Our quantitative analysis using the charge sum rule shows that even when films are maximally reduced, the averaged number of nickel $3d$ holes is 1.35. Superconducting samples have even higher values, calling into question the previously assumed limit of hole doping. Concomitant changes in the oxygen $K$-edge absorption spectra upon reduction indicate the presence of oxygen $2p$ holes, even in the most reduced films. Overall, our results suggest a complex interplay of hole doping mechanisms resulting from self-doping effects and oxygen non-stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Prediction of superconductivity in mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study density-balanced, mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers as a tunable platform for correlated quantum phases. With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.</description>

Abstract: A codimension-two spiral spin-liquid is a correlated paramagnetic state with one-dimensional ground state degeneracy hosted within a three-dimensional lattice. Here, via neutron scattering experiments and numerical simulations, we establish the existence of a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid in the effective honeycomb-lattice compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$, which demonstrates a novel path to spiral spin-liquids by overcoming the long-standing impediment of weak further-neighbor interactions. In the long-range ordered regime, competing spiral and spin density wave orders emerge as a function of applied magnetic field, among which a possible order-by-disorder transition is identified.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the normal state resistivity of cuprate superconductors Bi2201, Tl2201 and Hg1201</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar normal state resistivity data from two families of hole doped single layer cuprate superconductors $Bi2201$ (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) and $Tl2201$ (Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) are calculated using the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory (ECFL). This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures. The added case of $Bi2201$ is of particular interest since it was the original system where the almost linear in temperature resistivity was reported in 1990, and has been followed up by a systematic doping analysis only recently in 2022. The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconducting correlations in the Emery model and its connections to strange metallic transport and normal state coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for a superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear resistivity, the three-band model crosses the resistivity of the single-band model from above, indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. The enhanced conductivity is mainly contributed by a steep increase in the diffusivity of the three-band model at the crossover, suggesting that three-band transport is more coherent than single-band transport at lower temperatures. Below the same crossover temperature in the three-band model, the pair-field susceptibility increases more steeply than at higher temperatures or when compared to the single-band model. This suggests a possible connection between superconductivity and coherent transport, and further implies that coherent transport might be necessary for a model to capture the high-temperature superconductivity observed in hole-doped cuprates.</description>

Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description>

      <title>Emergent QED$_3$ at the bosonic Laughlin state to superfluid transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory of the stability of fractional Chern insulators based on the dipole picture of composite fermions (CFs). We construct CFs by binding vortices to Bloch electrons and derive a CF single-particle Hamiltonian that describes a Hofstadter problem in the enlarged CF Hilbert space, with the trace-condition term emerging naturally in the small-$q$ limit as part of the CF Hamiltonian. Going beyond the small-$q$ limit, we apply our theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ and calculate its CF band structures. The resulting CF phase diagram matches closely with that from exact diagonalization, and the projected many-body wavefunctions achieve exceptionally high overlaps with the latter. Our theory provides both a microscopic understanding and a computationally efficient tool for identifying fractional Chern insulators.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we place single-mode resonators or single-orbital artificial atoms at its vertices, edges and facets, and we devise near-neighbor hopping terms derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality maps of the simplicial complex of the triangulation. Regardless of the surface or its triangulation, these terms always lead to tight-binding Hamiltonians with large and clean topological spectral gaps, carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Ground states of a family of frustrated spin models for quasicrystals and their approximants</title>

Abstract: Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.</description>

      <title>Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear N\'eel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>

Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase should be ``kinematical'' singularities. We conjecture that the SMG interactions generate opposite-chirality bound states, which combine with the gapped elementary mirror states to form massive Dirac fermions. The propagator zeros can then be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we formulate a generalized no-go theorem which establishes the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. We also elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models. Finally, we compile a list of open questions which must be addressed in any SMG model in order to determine whether or not it is subject to the generalized no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <title>Irrational CFTs from coupled anyon chains with non-invertible symmetries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq3$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. Along the way, we characterize the phase diagram for $N=2$ coupled chains where we identify a weakly first-order phase transition as well as critical points that we are able to identify with known rational CFTs, except for one case. We also provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1&lt;c&lt;2.1$.</description>

      <title>Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</description>

      <title>Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Energy Reflection and Transmission of Interfaces in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \mu_L = c_R \mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of the group representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations were performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with wave vector q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 302 materials. Our method successfully identified the magnetic structures for 212 of these materials. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,900 magnetic materials. To demonstrate the utility of our database, we apply it to the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, leading to the identification of 1,070 and 392 instances, respectively.</description>
