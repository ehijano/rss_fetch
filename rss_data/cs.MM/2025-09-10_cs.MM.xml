      <title>A New Dataset and Benchmark for Grounding Multimodal Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of online misinformation videos poses serious societal risks. Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data, lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation (GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task, GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection.</description>

      <title>CommonVoice-SpeechRE and RPG-MoGe: Advancing Speech Relation Extraction with a New Dataset and Multi-Order Generative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech. Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research. Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.</description>

      <title>HuMo: Human-Centric Video Generation via Collaborative Multi-Modal Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text, reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control, we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

      <title>PianoVAM: A Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR) community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels, and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions, alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos. Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential applications.</description>

      <title>Memory-Anchored Multimodal Reasoning for Explainable Video Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address multimodal deepfake detection requiring both robustness and interpretability by proposing FakeHunter, a unified framework that combines memory guided retrieval, a structured Observation-Thought-Action reasoning loop, and adaptive forensic tool invocation. Visual representations from a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model and audio representations from a Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model retrieve semantically aligned authentic exemplars from a large scale memory, providing contextual anchors that guide iterative localization and explanation of suspected manipulations. Under low internal confidence the framework selectively triggers fine grained analyses such as spatial region zoom and mel spectrogram inspection to gather discriminative evidence instead of relying on opaque marginal scores. We also release X-AVFake, a comprehensive audio visual forgery benchmark with fine grained annotations of manipulation type, affected region or entity, reasoning category, and explanatory justification, designed to stress contextual grounding and explanation fidelity. Extensive experiments show that FakeHunter surpasses strong multimodal baselines, and ablation studies confirm that both contextual retrieval and selective tool activation are indispensable for improved robustness and explanatory precision.</description>

      <title>Hue4U: Real-Time Personalized Color Correction in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) affects nearly 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women worldwide. Existing color-correction methods often rely on prior clinical diagnosis and static filtering, making them less effective for users with mild or moderate CVD. In this paper, we introduce Hue4U, a personalized, real-time color-correction system in augmented reality using consumer-grade Meta Quest headsets. Unlike previous methods, Hue4U requires no prior medical diagnosis and adapts to the user in real time. A user study with 10 participants showed notable improvements in their ability to distinguish colors. The results demonstrated large effect sizes (Cohen's d &gt; 1.4), suggesting clinically meaningful gains for individuals with CVD. These findings highlight the potential of personalized AR interventions to improve visual accessibility and quality of life for people affected by CVD.</description>
