      <title>EFT strings and dualities in 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the states becoming light at perturbative limits of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ string and M-theory compactifications, identifying the different duality frames that emerge asymptotically and how they fit together in moduli space. These limits are characterized by the presence of EFT strings - a special class of axionic BPS strings whose tension, derived from the IR K\"ahler potential, vanishes in Planck units at infinite field distance. An intriguing integer scaling relation, $m \sim \mathcal{T}^w$ with $w = \{1,2,3\}$ in Planck units, connects the tension $\mathcal{T}$ of these strings to the mass scale $m$ of the leading tower of states along the string flow. We show that this relation also holds for the subleading towers below the species scale that generate the tower convex hull, implying that their associated $\vec\zeta = -\vec{\nabla} \log m$ vectors lie in a lattice generated by those of the EFT strings. This reveals a striking UV/IR interplay and offers organizing principles for the parametric hierarchies among the relevant UV scales in a given perturbative limit and the web of dualities governing 4d string vacua.</description>

      <title>A Nonperturbative Toolkit for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for demonstrating equivalences beyond the saddlepoint approximation between quantities in quantum gravity that are defined by the Euclidean path integral, without assumptions about holographic duality. The method involves three ingredients: (1) a way of resolving the identity with an overcomplete basis of microstates that is under semiclassical control, (2) a drastic simplification of the sum over topologies in the limit where the basis is infinitely overcomplete, and (3) a way of cutting and splicing geometries to demonstrate equality between two different gravitational path integrals even if neither can be explicitly computed. We illustrate our methods by giving a general argument that the thermal partition function of quantum gravity with two boundaries factorises. One implication of our results is that universes containing a horizon can sometimes be understood as superpositions of horizonless geometries entangled with a closed universe.</description>

      <title>Modified Microcausality from Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic microcausality is the statement that local field operators commute outside the light-cone. This condition is known to break down in low-energy effective theories, such as $P(X)$ models with a derivative interaction term of the ``wrong sign". Despite their Lorentz-invariant form, these theories can exhibit superluminal propagation on Lorentz-breaking backgrounds. We approach this phenomenon by computing the full operator-valued commutator in position space, perturbatively in interaction picture. After testing this formalism on a $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, we apply it to a $P(X)$ model. There, we show that the perturbative corrections to the free-theory commutator contain derivatives of delta functions with support on the standard Minkowski light cone. While these corrections vanish on Lorentz-invariant states, they become ``activated" on states where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken. In this case, they approximate the new ``sound-cone" by means of a Taylor expansion. By applying linear response theory to an extended source, we show that deviations from standard causality are already present at first order in this expansion. Finally, we try to understand what goes wrong with the standard argument according to which Lorentz invariance implies microcausality.</description>

      <title>Cosmology inside a black hole: adding matter on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Braneworlds inside an AdS black hole provide simple models where a closed cosmology can be encoded in a dual field theory. Previous studies have focused on pure-tension branes, where the only matter in the cosmology is that dual to the holographic bulk. We consider models with additional explicit matter fields on the brane. Both for perfect fluid matter and for an axion field on the brane, we show that this can avoid a self-intersection problem in the Euclidean construction of such geometries in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Geometrizing the Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently a manifestly gauge invariant formalism for calculating amplitudes in quantum electrodynamics was outlined in which the field strength, rather than the gauge potential, is used as the propagating field. To demonstrate the utility of this formalism we calculate the axial and gauge anomalies explicitly in theories with both electrically and magnetically charged particles. Usually the gauge anomaly is identified as an amplitude that (in certain theories) fails to be gauge invariant, so it seems particularly enlightening to understand it in a manifestly gauge invariant formalism. We find that the three photon amplitude is still anomalous in these same theories because it depends explicitly upon the choice of the Stokes surface needed to couple the field strength to sources, so the gauge anomaly arises from geometric considerations.</description>

      <title>Rotating axionic AdS$_4$ black hole dressed with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new four-dimensional axionic-charged rotating black hole with a scalar field, which is defined by a structural function coupling the axionic field and a scalar potential. This configuration is characterized by an integration constant and two parameters. The thermodynamic parameters are obtained via the Euclidean procedure, where the validity of the first law of thermodynamics is ensured. With the above information, we can see that this rotating configuration is a good laboratory from the perspective of the holographic superconductor, in which the angular parameter plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-Spin Currents and Flows in Auxiliary Field Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local, higher-spin conserved currents in integrable $2d$ sigma models that have been deformed via coupling to auxiliary fields. These currents generate integrability-preserving flows introduced by Smirnov and Zamolodchikov. For auxiliary field (AF) deformations of a free boson, we prove that local spin-$n$ currents exist for all $n$ and give recursion relations that characterize Smirnov-Zamolodchikov (SZ) flows driven by these currents. We then show how to construct spin-$2n$ currents in a unified class of auxiliary field sigma models with common structure -- including AF theories based on the principal chiral model (PCM), its non-Abelian T-dual, (bi-)Yang-Baxter deformations of the PCM, and symmetric space models -- for interaction functions of one variable, and describe SZ flows driven by any function of the stress tensor in these cases. Finally, we give perturbative solutions for spin-$3$ SZ flows in any member of our unified class of AF models with underlying $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra. Part of our analysis shows that the class of AF deformations can be extended by allowing the interaction function to depend on a larger set of variables than has previously been considered.</description>

      <title>The mass spectra in the Electroweak theory from the multiplicative Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, the nonstandard form of the Higgs Lagrangian constructed by the inverse problem of calculus of variations is applied to calculate the fermion mass spectra, the weak mixing angle, and $W/Z$ masses, where the SU(2) and U(1) gauge couplings are identical and all Yukawa couplings can be equal to the Higgs self couplings. In the large background field limit, all particles decouple and the Lagrangian itself remains renormalizable. We discuss the potential of the results in this work to incorporate with the quark mass matrix, the hierarchy problem and the one-loop effective potential.</description>

Abstract: We develop, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a method to compute correlation functions when the CFT is governed by the Lindblad equation for open quantum systems, via the AdS theory. Using a simple example in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we demonstrate that the predictions of the AdS theory based on our method match the direct computations in the dual CFT.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the microscopic derivation of the entropy and the holographic RG flow in 3D C-metric. We first discuss the case of a sector in BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black hole. By rescaling the Newton's constant we recover the area law of entropy of this sector by microstate counting. Then we apply this technique to all accelerating BTZ phases in 3D C-metric. Finally, for the boundary entropy in 3D C-metric, we study the monotonicity of the $g$-function of 3D C-metric in small acceleration limit and find that the $g$-theorem is satisfied only in $\rm I_{2}$.</description>

Abstract: We present a unified free field realization of representations for the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ with arbitrary levels, constructed using six free boson fields. This realization arises from a specialized factorization of the structure function within the defining relations of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$. Utilizing this free field realization, we further develop intertwining operators for the algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise a method recently introduced in the literature, that derives canonical differential equations, to multi-scale Feynman integrals with an underlying Calabi-Yau geometry. We start by recomputing a canonical form for the sunrise integral with all unequal masses. Additionally, we compute for the first time a canonical form for the three-loop banana integral with two unequal masses and for a four-loop banana integral with two unequal masses. For the integrals we compute, we find an $\epsilon$-form whose connection has at most simple poles. We motivate our construction by studying the Picard-Fuchs operators acting on the integrals considered. In the appendices, we give a constructive explanation for why our generalisation works.</description>

      <title>Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in ArXiv[2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in AdS5 where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by curvature : Analysis via non-perturbative 2PI Hartree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a classical background spacetime's curvature, via the 2 particle irreducible (2PI) non-perturbative effective action formalism. We use the standard Schwinger-DeWitt local expansion of the Feynman propagator, appropriate to probe the effect of spacetime curvature on the local or short scale physics. Recently it was shown using perturbative computations that such SSB is possible with a scalar with a quartic self interaction, positive rest mass squared and positive non-minimal coupling. Here we confirm in the two loop Hartree approximation that curvature can indeed induce SSB for such a theory. SSB for such a model is not possible in a flat spacetime. The 2PI technique does not only resum the self energy resulting in mass generation, but also resums, as we have discussed, curvature terms through such mass generation. We have explicitly discussed our results in the context of the de Sitter spacetime, although our calculations are valid for any non-singular curved spacetime. We show that, in contrast to the perturbative results, SSB is possible with a vanishing non-minimal coupling. These results are further extended to the case of an $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theory. Restoration of the broken symmetry in the thermal case is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constant-roll inflation is a distinctive class of phenomenological inflationary models in which the inflaton's rate of roll remains constant. It provides an exact solution that is compatible with the latest observational constraints and offers a natural framework for enhancing the curvature power spectrum, which is relevant to the formation of primordial black holes. In this paper, I review constant-roll inflation in memory of Alexei Starobinsky.</description>

      <title>Reduction of $\epsilon$-expanded Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Feynman integrals (FIs) at higher spacetime dimensions are free of infrared and collinear divergence--and their ultraviolet divergences can be systematically subtracted--this allows us to construct a wide range of locally finite Feynman integrals. Especially, we propose a method named $\bar{R}$-operation to subtract out ultraviolet divergences that at the same time preserves infrared and collinear safety of the original FI. By expressing these locally finite FIs in terms of master integrals and imposing constraints on their $\epsilon$-expanded forms, we reduce the $\epsilon$-expanded master integrals to a minimal basis. We provide an automated package to identify such constraints, offering a tool useful for high-order perturbative computations.</description>

      <title>Geodesic dynamics in brane-de Sitter wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamical analysis of the null and timelike geodesics around an asymptotically de Sitter wormhole in a Randall-Sundrum brane. In this framework, the wormhole throat is interpreted both as a photon sphere and as a fixed point of the associated dynamical system. The stability of this structure is evaluated using Lyapunov and Jacobi criteria with consistent results. A Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation is observed in the null-geodesic dynamics, highlighting critical changes in the behavior of light around the wormhole. Explicit solutions are derived for geodesics near the throat, providing insight into the optical appearance of the wormhole shadow. These results show qualitatively similar behavior for null and timelike orbits, suggesting universal features of geodesic dynamics in brane-de Sitter wormholes.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Study of QCD critical point with three-nucleon correlations in light nuclei yields ratios using PYTHIA8/Angantyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study utilizes the PYTHIA8 Angantyr model to systematically investigate the effects of three nucleons correlation $C_{n^2p}$ on the light nuclei yield ratio $N_tN_p/N_d^2$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV. The analysis explores this property across different rapidity ranges, collision centralities, and collision energies, while also examining the roles of multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) mechanisms. The results show that the light nuclei yield ratio remains stable with changes in rapidity coverage and collision centrality but slightly increases with rising collision energy. The impact of CR on the light nuclei yield ratio depends entirely on the presence of MPI; when MPI is turned off, CR has no effect. Additionally, the three-nucleon correlation, enhances the light nuclei yield ratio in both central and peripheral collisions. However, the non-monotonic energy dependence observed in experiments, the peak at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = $20\sim30$ GeV reported by the STAR experiment, cannot be explained by the Angantyr model due to its lack of key mechanisms related to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Nevertheless, the Angantyr model serves as an important baseline for studying collision behaviors in the absence of QGP effects.</description>

      <title>Global Gauge Symmetry Breaking in the Abelian Higgs Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to resolve the incompatibility between two extant gauge-invariant accounts of the Abelian Higgs mechanism: the first account uses global gauge symmetry breaking, and the second eliminates spontaneous symmetry breaking entirely. We resolve this incompatibility by using the constrained Hamiltonian formalism in symplectic geometry. First we argue that, unlike their local counterparts, global gauge symmetries are physical. The symmetries that are spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism are then the global ones. Second, we explain how the dressing field method singles out the Coulomb gauge as a preferred gauge for a gauge-invariant account of the Abelian Higgs mechanism. Based on the existence of this group of global gauge symmetries that are physical, we resolve the incompatibility between the two accounts by arguing that the correct way to carry out the second method is to eliminate only the redundant gauge symmetries, i.e. those local gauge symmetries which are not global. We extend our analysis to quantum field theory, where we show that the Abelian Higgs mechanism can be understood as spontaneous global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking in the $C^*$-algebraic sense.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitational waves from cosmological horizon radiation during de Sitter period: as zero-order approximation of inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the event horizon of the de Sitter universe can produce particles, and one can get sizable Hawking radiation by considering inflationary phases as de Sitter spacetimes with large Hubble rates. In this compact paper, we consider the graviton emission part of these radiations and assume that these graviton signals can exist in the current universe in the form of gravitational waves. We predict an energy density parameter of $\log_{10}(\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2) \sim \mathscr{O}(-25) - \mathscr{O}(-30)$ and its associated peak frequency $\log_{10}(f_{\rm peak}^0) \sim \mathscr{O}(6)-\mathscr{O}(5)$, depending on the reheating temperature. These signals occupy a frequency band below the ultrahigh-frequency regime and possess a detectable energy density, offering a promising target for future gravitational wave observatories. We believe that the detection of such signals would provide a compelling test of Hawking's radiation theory in a cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Atemporality from Conservation Laws of Physics in Lorentzian-Euclidean Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results have shown that singularities can be avoided from the general relativistic standpoint in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes by means of the transition from a Lorentzian to an Euclidean region where time loses its physical meaning and becomes imaginary. This dynamical mechanism, dubbed ``atemporality'', prevents the emergence of black hole singularities and the violation of conservation laws. In this paper, the notion of atemporality together with a detailed discussion of its implications is presented from a philosophical perspective. The main result consists in showing that atemporality is naturally related to conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r&gt;9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r&gt;2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model via relativistic Boltzmann equation in Isotropization Time Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0 $ in the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability.</description>

      <title>Pure Chromo-Natural Inflation: Signatures of Particle Production from Weak to Strong Backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \textit{Pure Natural Inflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom therein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field values, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-\'{a}-vis CMB observations than the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI). We show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the rolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production, invariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on the background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of both scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations may lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbifold/condensation completion procedure of defect topological quantum field theories can be seen as carrying out a lattice or state sum model construction internal to an ambient theory. In this paper, we propose a conceptual algebraic description of orbifolds/condensations for arbitrary tangential structures in terms of higher dagger structures and higher idempotents. In particular, we obtain (oriented) orbifold completion from (framed) condensation completion by using a general strictification procedure for higher dagger structures which we describe explicitly in low dimensions; we also discuss the spin and unoriented case. We provide several examples of higher dagger categories, such as those associated to state sum models, (orbifolds of) Landau--Ginzburg models, and truncated affine Rozansky--Witten models. We also explain how their higher dagger structures are naturally induced from rigid symmetric monoidal structures, recontextualizing and extending results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Extended Scalar Particle Solutions in Black String Spacetimes with Anisotropic Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar particle in a black string spacetime immersed in an anisotropic quintessence fluid surrounded by a cloud of strings, extending the analysis presented in our previous work. These novel solutions are dependent on the quintessence state parameter, $\alpha_{Q}$, and are now valid for a much larger domain of the radial coordinate. We investigate the cases when $\alpha_{Q} = 0,\,1/2,\,1$, encompassing both black hole and horizonless scenarios. We express the resulting radial wave functions using the confluent and biconfluent Heun functions, with special cases represented by Bessel functions. We derive restrictions on the allowed quantum energy levels by imposing constraints on the Heun parameters to ensure polynomial solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the emergence of "dark phases" associated with the radial wave function, focusing on the interesting case of $\alpha_{Q} = 1$. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics of scalar particles in this complex spacetime and the potential impact of dark energy on quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>From 5d Flat Connections to 4d Fluxes (the Art of Slicing the Cone)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Coulomb branch partition function of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector multiplet on closed simply-connected quasi-toric manifolds $B$. This includes a large class of theories, localising to either instantons or anti-instantons at the torus fixed points (including Donaldson-Witten and Pestun-like theories as examples). The main difficulty is to obtain flux contributions from the localisation procedure. We achieve this by taking a detour via the 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ vector multiplet on closed simply-connected toric Sasaki-manifolds $M$ which are principal $S^1$-bundles over $B$. The perturbative partition function can be expressed as a product over slices of the toric cone. By taking finite quotients $M/\mathbb{Z}_h$ along the $S^1$, the locus picks up non-trivial flat connections which, in the limit $h\to\infty$, provide the sought-after fluxes on $B$. We compute the one-loop partition functions around each topological sector on $M/\mathbb{Z}_h$ and $B$ explicitly, and then factorise them into contributions from the torus fixed points. This enables us to also write down the conjectured instanton part of the partition function on $B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the leading Wilson coefficient in type II string theory can take (almost) all values allowed by unitarity, crossing symmetry and maximal supersymmetry in D=10 and D=9 dimensions. This suggests that string theory might define the unique consistent quantum theory of gravity with maximal supersymmetry. We study the minima of the leading Wilson coefficient in D=6, 7 and 8 dimensions and find the global minimum at the point in moduli space with maximal symmetry. The minimum value turns out to always be negative for D&lt;8.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic soft graviton theorems from superrotation Ward identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft graviton theorems receive one-loop contributions that are logarithmic in the energy of the soft graviton, and which are closely related to tails of gravitational waveforms. We demonstrate that these logarithmic corrections are encoded in the Ward identity of superrotation symmetries, i.e. they follow from conservation of superrotation charge across spatial infinity $i^0$. Our proof relies on a careful analysis of the radiative phase space admitting such gravitational tails, and the determination of the fluxes through null infinity $\mathscr I$ that act as canonical generators of superrotations on both gravitational and matter fields. All logarithmic terms are derived from the fluxes through correlations of the supertranslation Goldstone mode, provided care is taken in manipulating gravitationally interacting (i.e. dressed) rather than free fields. In cases where massive particles take part in the scattering process, logarithmic corrections also partly arise from the superrotation charge generator at timelike infinity $i^\pm$.</description>

      <title>Gauging spacetime inversions in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacetime inversion symmetries such as parity and time reversal play a central role in physics, but they are usually treated as global symmetries. In quantum gravity there are no global symmetries, so any spacetime inversion symmetries must be gauge symmetries. In particular this includes $\mathcal{CRT}$ symmetry (in even dimensions usually combined with a rotation to become $\mathcal{CPT}$), which in quantum field theory is always a symmetry and seems likely to be a symmetry of quantum gravity as well. In this article we discuss what it means to gauge a spacetime inversion symmetry, and we explain some of the more unusual consequences of doing this. In particular we argue that the gauging of $\mathcal{CRT}$ is automatically implemented by the sum over topologies in the Euclidean gravity path integral, that in a closed universe the Hilbert space of quantum gravity must be a real vector space, and that in Lorentzian signature manifolds which are not time-orientable must be included as valid configurations of the theory. In particular we give an example of an asymptotically-AdS time-unorientable geometry which must be included to reproduce computable results in the dual CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general procedure for constructing an extended phase space for Yang-Mills theory at null infinity, capable of handling the asymptotic symmetries and construction of charges responsible for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems at all orders. The procedure is coordinate and gauge-choice independent, and can be fed into the calculation of both tree and loop-level soft limits. We find a hierarchy in the extended phase space controlled by the Bernoulli numbers arising in Todd genus computations. We give an explicit example of a calculation at tree level, in radial gauge, where we also uncover recursion relations at all orders for the equations of motion and charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some aspects of quantum field theory in a general (i.e. non inertial) frame of Minkowski spacetime are studied. Conditions for the presence of horizons as well as for the modification of the definition of positive energy solutions are examined. The standard wisdom is confirmed that none of these phenomena is generic. This corroborates that in the general case there is no natural way to define positive frequencies, which is the standard road to define particles. In that sense, (as well as in others) non inertial frames are similar to curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector in de Sitter space. We derive the full dynamics of the detector in the context of open quantum system, neither using Markovian or RWA approximations. We utilize quantum Fisher information (QFI) for Hubble parameter estimation, as a process function to distinguish the thermalization paths in detector Hilbert space, determined by its local properties, e.g., detector energy gap and its initial state preparation, or global spacetime geometry. We find that the non-Markovian contribution in general reduces the QFI comparing with Markovian approximated solution. Regarding to arbitrary initial states, the late-time QFI would converge to an asymptotic value. In particular, we are interested in the background field in the one parameter family of $\alpha$-vacua in de Sitter space. We show that for general $\alpha$-vacuum choices, the asymptotic values of converged QFI are significantly suppressed, comparing to previous known results for Bunch-Davies vacuum.</description>

We evaluated the propagators of the fermion and vector as well as the self energy and polarization and their dependence on the magnetic field. We also evaluated the temperature dependence of the Hall angle, no strange-metal behaviour is obtained, but the linear-$T$ resistivity is preserved under the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role. Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In analogy with the non-Abelian gauge helicities conserved in time for ``null fields", that we have defined previously, in this paper we first define non-Abelian fluid helicities and then total non-Abelian helicities for combined non-Abelian fluid and gauge fields. For a U(N) group the helicities considered are for both gluonic-type fluids, composed of particles in the adjoint representation, and quark-type fluids, in the $N$-dimensional Cartan subalgebra. We write down various Lagrangian formulations for the uncoupled and coupled systems. In each case we determine the equations of motion, symmetries, and a Hamiltonian formulation. Taking the velocity of the fluid in the adjoint representation, we find that in the case of the gluonic fluid, we can write a non-Abelian gluonic fluid Euler-Yang-Mills equation that conserves the defined helicities, and comes from a Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Vacua, Symmetries, and Higgsing of Chern-Simons Matter Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons Matter (CSM) theories typically preserve $ \mathcal{N}=3$ supersymmetry but can exhibit enhanced $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry under special conditions. A detailed understanding of the moduli space of CSM theories, however, has remained elusive. This paper addresses this gap by systematically analysing the maximal branches of the moduli space of $\mathcal{N}=3$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ CSM realised via Type IIB brane constructions. Firstly, for $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories with Chern-Simons levels equal $1$, the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ dualisation algorithm is employed to construct dual Lagrangian 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories without CS terms. This allows the full moduli space to be determined using quiver algorithms that compute Higgs and Coulomb branch Hasse diagrams and associated RG flows. Secondly, for $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories with CS-levels greater $1$, where $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ dualisation does not yield CS-free Lagrangians, a new prescription is introduced to derive two magnetic quivers, $\mathsf{MQ}_A $ and $\mathsf{MQ}_B$, whose Coulomb branches capture the maximal A and B branches of the original $\mathcal{N}=4$ CSM theory. Applying the decay and fission algorithm to $ \mathsf{MQ}_{A/B}$ then enables the systematic analysis of A/B branch RG flows and their geometric structures. Thirdly, for $\mathcal{N}=3$ CSM theories, one magnetic quiver for each maximal (hyper-K\"ahler) branch is derived from the brane system. This provides an efficient and comprehensive characterisation of these previously scarcely studied features.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we present a recursive method for $\ell$-loop planar integrands in colored quantum field theories. We start with the classical equation of motion and then pick out the comb component, which will help us to define the loop kernels. Then we construct the $\ell$-loop integrands based on some recursion rules for the $\ell$-loop kernels. Finally, we reach a recursion formula for the $\ell$-loop planar integrands. Our method can be easily generalized to general quantum field theories, even non-Lagrangian theories, to obtain the planar part of the whole $\ell$-loop integrands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</description>

Abstract: We have studied an $SO(4)$ gauged $O(5)$ Skyrmion on $\mathbb{R}^4$ which can be seen as a static soliton in $4+1$ dimension. This is a sequel of the known $SO(D)$ gauged $O(D+1)$ Skyrmions on $\mathbb{R}^D$ in $D=2$ and in $D=3$, with both of which its properties are compared. Two families of solutions are found, of these only one possessing a gauge decoupling limit. The curvatures of both of these solutions decay as $r^{-3}$, are bounded below by the topological charge, and are localised to an absolute scale. As such, they may have the potential of being interpreted as instantons.</description>

      <title>Viability of Boosted Light Dark Matter in a Two-Component Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boosted dark matter (BDM) scenario in a two-component model. We consider a neutrinophilic two-Higgs doublet model ($\nu$2HDM), which consists of one extra Higgs doublet and a light right-handed neutrino. This model is extended with a light ($\sim 10$~MeV) singlet scalar DM $\phi_3$, which is stabilized under an extra dark $Z_2^{\rm DM}$ symmetry and can only effectively annihilate through the CP even scalar $H$. Although oblique parameters put tight constraints on the model, introduction of vectorlike leptons (VLL) can potentially salvage the issue. The vectorlike doublet $N$ and singlet $\chi$ are also stabilized through dark $Z_2^{\rm DM}$ symmetry. The lightest vectorlike mass eigenstate ($\chi_1 \sim 100$~GeV) is the 2nd DM component of the model. The fermion DM is restricted in a narrow mass region while a somewhat broader mass region is allowed for the scalar DM. However, when two DM sectors are coupled, the annihilation channel $\chi_1 \chi_1 \to \phi_3 \phi_3$ opens up. As a result, the fermionic relic density decreases, and paves way for broader fermionic DM mass region with under-abundant relic: a region of $[30-65]$ GeV compared to a narrower $[40-50]$ GeV window for the single component case. On the other hand, the light DM $\phi_3$ acquires significant boost from the annihilation of $\chi_1$, causing a dilution in the resonant annihilation of $\phi_3$. This in turn increases the scalar DM relic, allowing for a smaller mass region compared to the individual case. The exact and underabundant relic is achievable in a significant parameter space of the two-component model where the total DM relic is mainly dominated by the fermionic DM contribution. The scalar DM is found to be sub-dominant or equally dominant ($\sim 30 \% - 80 \%$ of total DM) with significant boost which can be detected in experiments.</description>

      <title>Soft modes in hot QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral crossover of QCD at finite temperature and vanishing baryon density turns into a second order phase transition if lighter than physical quark masses are considered. If this transition occurs sufficiently close to the physical point, its universal critical behaviour would largely control the physics of the QCD phase transition. We quantify the size of this region in QCD using functional approaches, both Dyson-Schwinger equations and the functional renormalisation group. The latter allows us to study both critical and non-critical effects on equal footing, facilitating a precise determination of the scaling regime. We find that the physical point is far away from the critical region. Importantly, we show that the physics of the chiral crossover is dominated by soft modes even far beyond the critical region. While scaling functions determine all thermodynamic properties of the system in the critical region, the order parameter potential is the relevant quantity away from it. We compute this potential in QCD using the functional renormalisation group and Dyson-Schwinger equations and provide a simple parametrisation for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tests of quintessence in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on hilltop quintessence scenarios, able to satisfy theoretical constraints from quantum gravity. We discuss their realisation based on axions, their supersymmetric partners, and Higgs-like string constructions, including dynamical mechanisms to set up initial conditions at the hilltops. We also examine a specific parameterisation for dynamical dark energy suitable for hilltop quintessence. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature. However, all these constraints are sensitive to priors based on theoretical assumptions about viable regions of parameter space. Consequently, we discuss theoretical challenges in refining these priors, with the aim of maximizing the informative power of current and forthcoming cosmological datasets for testing dark energy scenarios in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Radiative Mass Mechanism: Addressing the Flavour Hierarchy and Strong CP Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of models based on the parity invariant Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), which incorporates the mechanism of radiative generation of fermion masses while simultaneously possessing the solution to the Strong CP problem. A flavour non-universal gauged abelian symmetry is imposed on top of LRSM, which helps in inducing the masses of second and first-generation fermions at one-loop and two-loop, respectively, and thereby reproduces the hierarchical spectrum of the masses. Parity invariance requires the vanishing of the strong CP parameter at the zeroth order, and the non-zero contribution arises at the two-loop level, which is in agreement with the experimental constraints. The minimal model predicts flavour symmetry breaking scale and the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry breaking scale at the same level. flavour non-universality of the new gauge interaction leads to various flavour-changing transitions both in quarks and leptonic sectors and, therefore, has various phenomenologically interesting signatures. The model predicts a new physics scale near $10^8$ GeV or above for phenomenological consistent solutions. This, in turn, restricts strong CP phase $\bar{\theta} \lesssim 10^{-14}$ as the parity breaking scale and flavour scale are related in the minimal framework.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with Skyrme Lyon (SLy)/Brussels-Montreal Skyrme functionals (BSk) class equations of state (EOSs), along with the M\"uller-Serot (MS2) EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Generalized Entropy onto Bardeen Black Hole Surrounded by Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic characteristics and geothermodynamics of a Bardeen black hole (BH) that interacts with a string cloud and is minimally connected to nonlinear electrodynamics. To avoid the singularities throughout the cosmic evolution, we consider an entropy function which comprises five parameters. In addition, by employing this entropy function for the specific range of parameters, we obtain the representations of BH entropy based on the holographic principle. Moreover, we employ this entropy function to investigate its impact on the thermodynamics of the BH by studying various thermodynamic properties like mass, temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy for numerous scalar charge and string cloud values. To support our investigation, we use various geothermodynamics formalisms to evaluate the stable behavior and identify different physical scenarios. Furthermore, in this analysis, we observe that only one entropy formalism provides us with better results regarding the thermodynamic behavior of the BH. Moreover, it is shown that one of the entropy models provides a thermodynamic geometric behavior compared to the other entropy models.</description>

      <title>Time Advance and Probability Conservation in $PT$-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does not obey $U^{\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not lost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different form. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due to $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must exist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\dagger}$, so that $V^{-1}U^{\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with decay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation. Thus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from the excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Stability of the Dark Energy Model from Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background, which play a crucial role in the field's dynamics. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [2].</description>
