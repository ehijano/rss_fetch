      <title>Enhancing Anomaly Detection in Financial Markets with an LLM-based Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework designed to enhance anomaly detection within financial market data, tackling the longstanding challenge of manually verifying system-generated anomaly alerts. The framework harnesses a collaborative network of AI agents, each specialised in distinct functions including data conversion, expert analysis via web research, institutional knowledge utilization or cross-checking and report consolidation and management roles. By coordinating these agents towards a common objective, the framework provides a comprehensive and automated approach for validating and interpreting financial data anomalies. I analyse the S&amp;P 500 index to demonstrate the framework's proficiency in enhancing the efficiency, accuracy and reduction of human intervention in financial market monitoring. The integration of AI's autonomous functionalities with established analytical methods not only underscores the framework's effectiveness in anomaly detection but also signals its broader applicability in supporting financial market monitoring.</description>

      <title>Risk exchange under infinite-mean Pareto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal decisions of agents who aim to minimize their risks by allocating their positions over extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) and possibly dependent losses. The loss distributions of our focus are super-Pareto distributions which include the class of extremely heavy-tailed Pareto distributions. For a portfolio of super-Pareto losses, non-diversification is preferred by decision makers equipped with well-defined and monotone risk measures. The phenomenon that diversification is not beneficial in the presence of super-Pareto losses is further illustrated by an equilibrium analysis in a risk exchange market. First, agents with super-Pareto losses will not share risks in a market equilibrium. Second, transferring losses from agents bearing super-Pareto losses to external parties without any losses may arrive at an equilibrium which benefits every party involved. The empirical studies show that extremely heavy tails exist in real datasets.</description>

      <title>Measuring Name Concentrations through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new deep learning approach for the quantification of name concentration risk in loan portfolios. Our approach is tailored for small portfolios and allows for both an actuarial as well as a mark-to-market definition of loss. The training of our neural network relies on Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling which we explicitly formulate for the CreditRisk${+}$ and the ratings-based CreditMetrics model. Numerical results based on simulated as well as real data demonstrate the accuracy of our new approach and its superior performance compared to existing analytical methods for assessing name concentration risk in small and concentrated portfolios.</description>
