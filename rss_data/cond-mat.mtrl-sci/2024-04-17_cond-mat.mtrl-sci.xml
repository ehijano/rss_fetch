      <title>Two-stage growth for highly ordered epitaxial C$_{60}$ films on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an organic semiconductor and a prototypical acceptor molecule in organic photovoltaics, C$_{60}$ has broad relevance to the world of organic thin film electronics. Although highly uniform C$_{60}$ thin films are necessary to conduct spectroscopic analysis of the electronic structure of these C$_{60}$-based materials, reported C$_{60}$ films show a relatively low degree of order beyond a monolayer. Here, we develop a generalizable two-stage growth technique that consistently produces single-domain C$_{60}$ films of controllable thicknesses, using Au(111) as an epitaxially well-matched substrate. We characterize the films using low-energy electron diffraction, low-energy electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We report highly oriented epitaxial film growth of C$_{60}$/Au(111) from 1 monolayer (ML) up to 20 ML films. The high-quality of the C$_{60}$ thin films enables the direct observation of the electronic dispersion of the HOMO and HOMO-1 bands via ARPES without need for small spot sizes. Our results indicate a path for the growth of organic films on metallic substrates with long-range ordering.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary metastability controls irradiation resistance in nanocrystalline metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline materials are powerful sinks for irradiation defects. While standard theories assume that the sink efficiency of a grain boundary is defined solely by its character before irradiation, recent evidence conclusively shows that the irradiation sink efficiency is a highly dynamic property controlled by the intrinsic metastability of GBs under far-from-equilibrium irradiation conditions. In this paper, we reveal that the denuded (i.e., defect-free) zone, typically the signature of a strong sink, can collapse as irradiation damage accumulates. We propose a radiation damage evolution model that captures this behavior based on the emergence of a series of irradiation defect-enabled metastable GB microstate changes that dynamically alter the ability of the GB to absorb further damage. We show that these microstate changes control further defect absorption and give rise to the formation of a defect network that manifests itself as a net Nye-tensor signal detectable via lattice curvature experiments.</description>

      <title>General theory for longitudinal nonreciprocal charge transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal nonreciprocal charge transport (NCT) in crystalline materials is a highly non-trivial phenomenon, motivating the design of next generation two-terminal rectification devices (e.g., semiconductor diodes beyond PN junctions). The practical application of such devices is built upon crystalline materials whose longitudinal NCT occurs at room temperature and under low magnetic field. However, materials of this type are rather rare and elusive, and theory guiding the discovery of these materials is lacking. Here, we develop such a theory within the framework of semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. By symmetry analysis, we classify the complete 122 magnetic point groups with respect to the longitudinal NCT phenomenon. The symmetry-adapted Hamiltonian analysis further uncovers a previously overlooked mechanism for this phenomenon. Our theory guides the first-principles prediction of longitudinal NCT in multiferroic \epsilon-Fe2O3 semiconductor that possibly occurs at room temperature, without the application of external magnetic field. These findings advance our fundamental understandings of longitudinal NCT in crystalline materials, and aid the corresponding materials discoveries.</description>

      <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US-DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data-Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing solid-state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid-state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high-performance solid-state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data-driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid-state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg-H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US-DOE).</description>

      <title>Lifetime predictions for virgin and recycled high-density polyethylene under creep conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recycling has become a predominant subject in industry and science due to a rising concern for the environment driven by high production volume of plastics. Replacement of virgin polymers with their recycled analogs is not always possible because recycled polymers cannot met the same property profiles as their virgin counterparts. To avoid deterioration of the mechanical properties, it is proposed to replace a virgin polymer with a recycled polymer of another grade whose characteristics (measured in tensile tests) are close to those of the virgin material. This approach opens a way for the use of recycled polymers in short-term application, but its suitability for long-term applications has not yet been assessed. A thorough experimental investigation is conducted of the mechanical response of virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) used for insulation of pipes and recycled HDPE manufactured from post-consumer plastic waste (their stiffness, strength and elongation to break adopt similar values). A model is presented in viscoelastoplasticity of semicrystalline polymers. Its parameters are determined by matching experimental data in short-term relaxation and creep tests. The lifetime of virgin and recycled HDPE under creep conditions is evaluated by means of numerical simulation. It is shown that the stress-time to failure diagrams for virgin and recycled HDPE practically coincide.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction over Cu-decorated Biphenylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction into value-added products is crucial for the green economy. Inspired by the recent synthesis of Biphenylene (BPH), we have systematically investigated pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH as an electrocatalyst for the CO$_2$ reduction reactions (CRR). Our first-principles calculations show the CO$_2$ molecules weakly interact with the pristine BPH surface while defective BPH facilitates the CO$_2$ adsorption with a binding energy ($E_b$) of -3.22 eV, indicating the detrimental process for the CRR on the surface of both systems. Furthermore, we have investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO$_2$ molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with $E_b$ of -0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial intermediate states, formate ($\mathrm{^*OCOH}$) and the carboxylic ($\mathrm{^*COOH}$) pathways. The formate pathway confirms the conversion of $\mathrm{^*OCOH}$ to $\mathrm{^*HCOOH}$ with the rate-limiting potential ($U_L$) of 0.57 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of $\mathrm{^*COH}$ to $\mathrm{^*CHOH}$ has $U_L$ of 0.49 eV for the production of CH$_3$OH. We have also investigated the effect of protons using charged hydrogen pseudopotential, which hints towards the possible formation of CH$_3$OH as fuel. Our findings propose Cu-BPH as an efficient single-atom catalyst for CO$_2$ conversion compared to the well-known Cu metal.</description>

      <title>A stochastic discrete slip approach to microplasticity: Application to submicron W pillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic discrete slip approach is proposed to model plastic deformation in submicron domains. The model is applied to the study of submicron pillar ($D~\leq~1\mu m$) compression experiments on tungsten (W), a prototypical metal for applications under extreme conditions. Slip events are geometrically resolved in the specimen and considered as eigenstrain fields producing a displacement jump across a slip plane. This novel method includes several aspects of utmost importance to small-scale plasticity, i.e. source truncation effects, surface nucleation effects, starvation effects, slip localization and an inherently stochastic response. Implementation on an FFT-spectral solver results in an efficient computational 3-D framework. Simulations of submicron W pillars ($D~\leq~1\mu m$) under compression show that the method is capable of capturing salient features of sub-micron scale plasticity. These include the natural competition between pre-existing dislocations and surface nucleation of new dislocations. Our results predict distinctive flow stress power-law dependence exponents as well as a size-dependence of the strain-rate sensitivity exponent. The results are thoroughly compared with experimental literature.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Stability of O-Sublattice in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently reported remarkably high radiation tolerance of $\gamma$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ double-polymorphic structure brings this ultrawide bandgap semiconductor to the frontiers of power electronics applications that are able to operate in challenging environments. Understanding the mechanism of radiation tolerance is crucial for further material modification and tailoring of the desired properties. In this study, we employ machine-learning-enhanced atomistic simulations to assess the stability of both the gallium (Ga) and oxygen (O) sublattices under various levels of damage. Our study uncovers the remarkable resilience and stability of the O-sublattice, attributing this property to the strong tendency of recovery of the O defects, especially within the stronger disordered regions. Interestingly, we observe the opposite behavior of the Ga defects that display enhanced stability in the same regions of increased disorder. Moreover, we observe that highly defective $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is able to transform into $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ upon annealing due to preserved lattice organization of the O-sublattice. This result clearly manifests that the ultrahigh stability of the O-sublattice provides the backbone for the exceptional radiation tolerance of the $\gamma$/$\beta$ double-polymorphic structure. These computational insights closely align with experimental observations, opening avenues for further exploration of polymorphism in Ga$_2$O$_3$ and potentially in analogous polymorphic families spanning a broad range of diverse materials of complex polymorphic nature.</description>

      <title>Efficient structural relaxation based on the random phase approximation: Applications to the water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an improved implementation for evaluating the analytical gradients of the random phase approximation (RPA) electron-correlation energy based on atomic orbitals and the localized resolution of identity scheme. The more efficient RPA force calculations allow us to relax structures of medium-size water clusters. Particular attention is paid to the structures and energy orderings of the low-energy isomers of (H$_2$O)$_n$ clusters with $n=21$, 22, and 25. It is found that the energy ordering of the low-energy isomers of these water clusters are rather sensitive to how their structures are determined. For the five low-energy isomers of (H$_2$O)$_{25}$, the RPA energy ordering based on the RPA geometries is quite different from that based on the geometries relaxed by lower-level theories, in contrast with the situation of small water clusters like the water hexamer. The standard RPA underbinds the water clusters, and this underbinding behavior gets more pronounced as the complete basis set (CBS) limit is approached. The renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction remedies this underbinding, giving rise to a noticeable overbinding behavior at finite basis sets. However, as the CBS limit is approached, RPA+rSE yields an accuracy for the binding energies that is comparable to the best available double hybrid functionals, as demonstrated for the WATER27 testset.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dynamical charges in two-dimensional ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity is commonly understood in terms of dynamical charges, which represent the dipole moments generated by atomic displacements or the forces induced by electric fields. In ferroelectrics with a high degree of symmetry, the dynamical charges are typically symmetric tensors, and can be visualized as ellipsoids. In van der Waals (vdW) materials which break centrosymmetry, a new type of ferroelectricity arises which differs greatly from conventional ferroelectrics. The polarization is purely electronic, arising from an interlayer charge transfer, and most of the polarization generated is perpendicular to atomic motion. We show that the unconventional properties of vdW ferroelectrics are manifested in their dynamical charges, which exhibit spatial modulation and intrinsic asymmetry. Dynamical charges in vdW ferroelectrics, and more generally, any strongly anisotropic ferroelectric, can be visualized as deformable, non-ideal ellipsoids dependent on the atomic configuration. Furthermore, we show that, due to the mixed electrostatic boundary conditions employed for two-dimensional materials, non-diagonal dynamical charges in 2D materials are always asymmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low symmetry and anistropic lattice of 1T$'$ WTe$_2$ is responsible for the existence of parallel one-dimensional channels in the moir\'e patterns of twisted bilayers. This gives the opportunity to explore moir\'e physics of a different nature to that widely observed in twisted bilayers of materials with hexagonal symmetries. Here, we combine plane-wave and linear-scaling density functional theory calculations to describe the electronic properties of twisted bilayer 1T$'$ WTe$_2$. For a small change in the lattice parameters of the constituent 1T$'$ WTe$_2$ monolayers, we find a substantial moir\'e-induced striped electrostatic potential landscape in the twisted bilayer, with a peak-to-trough magnitude $&gt;$200~meV.</description>

      <title>Electronic Properties of Electroactive Ferrocenyl-Functionalized MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attachment of redox active molecules to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, constitutes a promising approach for designing electrochemically switchable devices through the control of the material charge/spin transport properties by the redox state of the grafted molecule and thus the applied electrical potential. In this work, defective plasma treated MoS2 is functionalized by a ferrocene derivative and thoroughly investigated by various characterization techniques, such as Raman, photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemistry. Furthermore, in-plane and out-of-plane conductive-AFM measurements (I-V and first derivative dI/dV-V curves) are measured to investigate the effect of the chemical functionalization of MoS2 on the electron transport properties. While the conduction and valence bands are determined at +0.7 and -1.2 eV with respect of the electrode Fermi energy for pristineMoS2, additional states in an energy range of ca. 0.45 eV below the MoS2 conduction band are measured after plasma treatment, attributed to S-vacancies. For ferrocene functionalized MoS2, the S-vacancy states are no longer observed resulting from the defect healing. However, two bumps at lower voltages in the dI/dV-V indicate a contribution to the electron transport through ferrocene HOMO, which is located in the MoS2 band gap at ca. 0.4-0.6 eV below the Fermi energy. These results are in good agreement with theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements.</description>

      <title>Roles of band gap and Kane electronic dispersion in the THz-frequency nonlinear optical response in HgCdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with linear electronic dispersion often feature high carrier mobilities and unusually strong nonlinear optical interactions. In this work, we investigate the THz nonlinear dynamics of one such material, HgCdTe, with an electronic band dispersion heavily dependent on both temperature and stoichiometry. We show how the band gap, carrier concentration and band shape together determine the nonlinear response of the system. At low temperatures, carrier generation from Zener tunneling dominates the nonlinear response with a reduction in the overall transmission. At room temperature, quasi-ballistic electronic dynamics drive the largest observed nonlinear optical interactions, leading to a transmission increase. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of these nonlinear optical properties of narrow-gap materials to small changes in the electronic dispersion and carrier concentration.</description>

      <title>Arsenic diffusion in MOVPE-Grown GaAs/Ge epitaxial structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium is reemerging as a prominent material in the semiconductor field, particularly for electronic applications, photonics, photovoltaics and thermophotovoltaics. Its combination with III-V compound semiconductors through epitaxial growth by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) is instrumental and thus, the comprehension of the sequential stages in such epitaxial processes is of great importance. During the deposition of GaAs on p-type Ge, the formation of n/p junctions occurs when As diffuses into Ge. It is found that this formation begins in the so-called AsH3 preexposure where Ge substrate is firstly exposed to AsH3. Also important is the fact that both free carrier profiles and As profiles indicate that prolonged AsH3 preexposure times lead to deeper diffusion depths for the same process time. This effect is concomitant with the degradation of the Ge surface morphology, characterized by higher roughness as the AsH3 preexposure duration is extended. Contrary to ion-implanted As in germanium, which shows quadratic dependent diffusivity, our MOVPE investigation using AsH3 indicates a linear relationship, consistent with Takenaka et al.'s MOVPE study using TBAs. Analyzing As profiles alongside simulations, with and without subsequent GaAs epitaxy, suggests the generation of Ge vacancies during the process, contributing to deeper As diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a workhorse of modern atomistic simulations, and recently published universal MLIPs, pre-trained on large datasets, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy and generalizability. However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce ''Berry-dipole semimetals'', whose band degeneracies are characterized by quantized Berry dipoles. Through a two-band model constructed by Hopf map, we reveal that the Berry-dipole semimetals display a multitude of salient properties distinct from other topological semimetals. On the boundary, we find that the first-order Berry-dipole semimetal harbors anomalous paired Fermi arcs with the same spin polarization, even though the layer Chern number is zero, and the second-order Berry-dipole semimetal hosts dispersionless hinge arcs. In the bulk, we find that the low-energy Berry-dipole Hamiltonian near the band node has a quadratic energy dispersion and peculiar Berry curvature, which give rise to rather unique characteristics in the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, orbital magnetization and Landau levels. Our study shows that Berry-dipole semimetals are a class of topological gapless phases supporting rich intriguing physics.</description>

      <title>Superpolarized Electron-Hole Liquid and Multiferroicity in Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a many-body state termed superpolarized electron-hole liquid to explain the multiferroic properties observed in a recent experiment on rhombohedral pentalayer graphene by Han et al. [Nature 623, 41-47, 2023] . Superpolarization refers to a state where electrons and holes are fully polarized in opposite directions within the extended spin-valley space, resulting in a polarization per charge that exceeds the saturated value of one. This state exhibits multiferroic order, characterized by spontaneous spin, layer, and valley polarization. We demonstrate the independent control of valley polarization and orbital magnetization in this state through the application of electric-displacement field and weak magnetic fields. The large magnetoelectric effect observed in the experiment is attributed to the substantial Berry curvature concentrated near the band edge. The concept of superpolarization can be probed experimentally through magnetic oscillation and local current distribution measurements to determine the area of the Fermi surfaces and their magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>A strongly interacting, two-dimensional, dipolar spin ensemble in (111)-oriented diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of spins with strong dipolar interactions and controlled dimensionality enable new explorations in quantum sensing and simulation. In this work, we investigate the creation of strong dipolar interactions in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers generated via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on (111)-oriented diamond substrates. We find that diamond growth on the (111) plane yields high incorporation of spins, both nitrogen and NV centers, where the density of the latter is tunable via the miscut of the diamond substrate. Our process allows us to form dense, preferentially aligned, 2D NV ensembles with volume-normalized AC sensitivity down to $\eta_{AC}$ = 810 pT um$^{3/2}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$. Furthermore, we show that (111) affords maximally positive dipolar interactions amongst a 2D NV ensemble, which is crucial for leveraging dipolar-driven entanglement schemes and exploring new interacting spin physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are intriguing targets for exploring unconventional physical properties of massless fermions. Among them, nodal line or nodal ring semimetals have attracted attention for their unique one-dimensional band contact in momentum space and resulting nontrivial quantum phenomena. By field angular resolved magnetotransport measurements and theoretical calculations, we show that pressurized black phosphorus (BP) is an ideal nodal ring semimetal with weak spin-orbit coupling, which has a sole and carrier density-tunable nodal ring isolated from other trivial bands. We also revealed that the large magnetoresistance effect and its field-angular dependence in semimetallic BP are due to highly anisotropic relaxation time. Our results establish pressurized BP as an elemental model material for exploring nontrivial quantum properties unique to the topological nodal ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As nascent nonlinear oscillators, nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) represent a promising potential for integration into more complicated systems such as neural networks, magnetic field sensors, and radio frequency (RF) signal classification, their tunable high-frequency operating regime, easy synchronization, and CMOS compatibility can streamline the process. To implement SHNOs in any of these networks, the electrical features of a single device are needed before designing the signal detection CMOS circuitry. This study centers on presenting an empirical electrical model of the SHNO based on a comprehensive characterization of the output impedance of a single SHNO, and its available output power in the range of 2-10 GHz at various bias currents.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties within DPOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse\textcolor{red}{.} The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>

      <title>Lateral Solid Phase Epitaxy of Yttrium Iron Garnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid phase epitaxy is a crystallization technique used to produce high quality thin films. Lateral solid phase epitaxy furthermore enables the realization of non-planar structures, which are interesting, e.g., in the field of spintronics. Here, we demonstrate lateral solid phase epitaxy of yttrium iron garnet over an artificial edge, such that the crystallization direction is perpendicular to the initial seed. We use single crystalline garnet seed substrates partially covered by a SiOx film to study the lateral crystallization over the SiOx mesa. The yttrium iron garnet layer retains the crystal orientation of the substrate not only when in direct contact with the substrate, but also across the edge on top of the SiOx mesa. By controlling the crystallization dynamics it is possible to almost completely suppress the formation of polycrystals and to enable epitaxial growth of single crystalline yttrium iron garnet on top of mesas made from arbitrary materials. From a series of annealing experiments, we extract an activation energy of 3.0 eV and a velocity prefactor of $6.5 \times 10^{14}$ nm/s for the lateral epitaxial crystallization along the &lt;100&gt; direction. Our results pave the way to engineer single crystalline non-planar yttrium iron garnet structures with controlled crystal orientation.</description>

      <title>GPAW: An open Python package for electronic-structure calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the GPAW open-source Python package for electronic structure calculations. GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave method and can solve the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) equations using three different wave-function representations, namely real-space grids, plane waves, and numerical atomic orbitals. The three representations are complementary and mutually independent and can be connected by transformations via the real-space grid. This multi-basis feature renders GPAW highly versatile and unique among similar codes. By virtue of its modular structure, the GPAW code constitutes an ideal platform for implementation of new features and methodologies. Moreover, it is well integrated with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) providing a flexible and dynamic user interface. In addition to ground-state DFT calculations, GPAW supports many-body GW band structures, optical excitations from the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE), variational calculations of excited states in molecules and solids via direct optimization, and real-time propagation of the Kohn-Sham equations within time-dependent DFT. A range of more advanced methods to describe magnetic excitations and non-collinear magnetism in solids are also now available. In addition, GPAW can calculate non-linear optical tensors of solids, charged crystal point defects, and much more. Recently, support of GPU acceleration has been achieved with minor modifications of the GPAW code thanks to the CuPy library. We end the review with an outlook describing some future plans for GPAW.</description>

      <title>Area Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam Seeding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high-purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre- and post-processing of a mask to produce structures. This paper presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal-organic precursor Au(acac)Me$_2$ locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in the same CVD cycle without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80 {\deg}C, over 200 K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of around 40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, they allow for the first time the precise determination of the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam.</description>

Abstract: We performed molecular dynamics simulations of Zr$_{50}$Cu$_{50}$ metallic glass samples submitted to mechanical deformation at different strain rates. The simultaneous measurements of the stress-strain curve, and of the temperature evolution during the cyclic mechanical load, are used to determine the thermo-mechanical constitutive laws at the continuum scale. It is shown that plastic deformation acts as a heat source, but strong finite size effects affect the unfolding of shear bands and its related dissipation rate. Finally, a thermo-mechanical constitutive law is proposed to reproduce quantitavely self-heating processes at different scales.</description>

Abstract: We thoroughly investigate the microscopic mechanisms of the thermal transport in orthorhombic \textit{o}-CsCu$_5$S$_3$ by integrating the first-principles-based self-consistent phonon calculations (SCP) with the linearized Wigner transport equation (LWTE). Our methodology takes into account contributions to phonon energy shifts and phonon scattering rates from both three- and four-phonon processes. Additionally, it incorporates the off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators to calculate the total thermal conductivity. The predicted $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ with an extremely weak temperature dependence following $\sim T^{-0.33}$, in good agreement with experimental values along with the parallel to the Bridgman growth direction. Such nonstandard temperature dependence of $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ can be traced back to the dual particlelike-wavelike behavior exhibited by thermal phonons. Specifically, the coexistence of the stochastic oscillation of Cs atoms and metavalent bonding among interlayer Cu-S atoms limits the particle-like phonon propagation and enhances the wave-like tunneling of phonons. Simultaneously, the electrical transport properties are determined by employing a precise momentum relaxation-time approximation (MRTA) within the framework of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE). By properly adjusting the carrier concentration, excellent thermoelectric performance is achieved, with a maximum thermoelectric conversion efficiency of 18.4$\%$ observed at 800 K in \textit{p}-type \textit{o}-CsCu$_5$S$_3$.} Our work not only elucidates the anomalous thermal transport behavior in the copper-based chalcogenide \textit{o}-CsCu$_5$S$_3$ but also provides insights for manipulating its thermal and electronic properties for potential thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why is the question in the title pertinent? Toxic gases, which are detrimental to both human health and the environment, have been released in greater quantities as a result of industrial development. These gases necessitate capture, immobilization, and measurement. Consequently, the present study investigates the interactions between boron-nitride nanobelt and M\"obius-type boron-nitride nanobelt and nine greenhouse gases, namely ammonia, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, methanol, nitric dioxide, nitric oxide, and phosgene. The adsorption energies calculated for the structures with optimized geometry are all negative, suggesting that all gases are adsorbed favorably in both nanobelts. Furthermore, we discovered that the recovery time of the sensors ranges from two hours to a few nanoseconds, and that the nanobelts exhibit distinct responses to each gas. According to electronic and topological investigations, covalent bonds were exclusively formed by nitric oxide; the remaining gases formed non-covalent bonds. Molecular dynamics ultimately demonstrate that the interaction between a single gas molecule and the nanobelt remains consistent across the vast majority of gases, whereas the interaction between 500 gas molecules and the nanobelts functions as an attraction, notwithstanding the impact of volumetric effects characteristic of high volume gases on the interaction. For the completion of each calculation, semiempirical tight-binding methods were implemented utilizing the xTB software. The outcomes of our study generated a favorable response to the inquiry posed in the title.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric topological phases with Pontryagin index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a certain class of three-dimensional topological insulators and semimetals protected by spinless $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, hosting an integer-valued bulk invariant. We show using homotopy arguments that these phases host multi-gap topology, providing a realization of a single $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant in three spatial dimensions that is distinct from the Hopf index. We identify this invariant with the Pontryagin index, which describes BPST instantons in particle physics contexts and corresponds to a 3-sphere winding number. We study naturally arising multi-gap linked nodal rings, topologically characterized by split-biquaternion charges, which can be removed by non-Abelian braiding of nodal rings, even without closing a gap. We additionally connect the describing winding number in terms of gauge-invariant combinations of non-Abelian Berry connection elements, indicating relations to Pontryagin characteristic class in four dimensions. These topological configurations are furthermore related to fully non-degenerate multi-gap phases that are characterized by a pair of winding numbers relating to two isoclinic rotations in the case of four bands and can be generalized to an arbitrary number of bands. From a physical perspective, we also analyze the edge states corresponding to this Pontryagin index as well as their dissolution subject to the gap-closing disorder. Finally, we elaborate on the realization of these novel non-Abelian phases, their edge states and linked nodal structures in acoustic metamaterials and trapped-ion experiments.</description>

Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for the formation of a superfluid state in two-dimensional systems. A number of studies reported observations of ultrafast nondiffusive propagation of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures, which was considered by their authors as possible evidence of collective effects in excitonic systems. In this paper, after a brief analysis of exciton propagation regimes in two-dimensional semiconductors, an alternative model of ultrafast exciton transport is proposed, based on the formation of waveguide modes in van der Waals heterostructures and the radiation transfer by these modes.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) inspired mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector wavefunctions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector wavefunctions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW pseudopotential inspired, basis set method for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO or lo (Localized orbitals) basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis for a hybrid basis for small molecules.</description>
