      <title>Proton Pressure: A Simplified Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the authors present a simplified method for determining proton pressure, based on concepts from statistical mechanics, quantum chromodynamics - specifically asymptotic freedom of quarks - and other well-established physical concepts. The result obtained for the proton pressure was $0.3570\times10^{35}$ Pa, which is consistent with recently reported experimental data.</description>

      <title>Axions and Axion-like particles: collider searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an overview of collider searches for Axion-like particles (ALPs). The intention of this review is to give a pedagogical introduction to collider phenomenology of ALPs, and provide a starting point for newcomers, including suitable references to deepen their knowledge. We motivate how ALPs arise from the breaking of approximate global symmetries and describe their interactions across different scales in an effective field theory framework. We further review the dominant production and decay channels for ALPs at high-energy hadron and lepton colliders as well as indirect ways to probe their interactions via precision measurements of Standard Model processes.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Pair Energy Correlators: From Profiling Partonic Splittings to Probing Heavy-Flavor Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce heavy-flavor energy correlators, $\langle \Psi |\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{H}}(\vec{n}_1) \mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{H}}(\vec{n}_2)|\Psi \rangle$, as a powerful observable for profiling partonic splittings and characterizing heavy-flavor fragmentation. We present its collinear factorization, perform resummation, and demonstrate the angular distribution's sensitivity to both the heavy-quark pair splitting and their subsequent fragmentation. We then apply the heavy-flavor EEC to probe medium-induced effects, revealing its sensitivity to medium modifications to heavy-quark pair splitting functions and to the medium's spatial structure.</description>

      <title>Scalar leptoquark contributions to the $gg\rightarrow Zh$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the general scalar leptoquark contributions to the $gg\rightarrow Zh$ process at one-loop level. We find that the contributions only show up for the off-diagonal Higgs and $Z$ boson interactions with scalar leptoquarks, which can lead to a new tensor structure different from the standard model. In the one-field and two-field models, the contributions vanish exactly; thus, the contributions are possible at least in the three-field models. We exemplify the contributions in the $S_1+\widetilde{R}_2+S_3$ model, which can appear in the presence of scalar leptoquark mass splittings and $CP$ violation. In view of the heavy scalar leptoquark mass suppression, the leading contributions are typically small and difficult to observe at hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis of color superconductivity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color superconductivity in cold, dense quark matter is a key feature of the QCD phase diagram, whose present theoretical understanding relies predominantly on weak-coupling calculations. In this work, we revisit the evaluation of the color-superconducting gap using a renormalization group (RG) framework formulated in effective theory near the Fermi surface. By incorporating quark self-energy corrections into the RG equation, we reproduce the known weak-coupling results from the gap equation at the same perturbative order at $O(g^0)$. Within the RG approach, the angular momentum structure of the pairing channel becomes more transparent, allowing us to examine the size of the gap for various pairing patterns. We also compare our results with recent lattice QCD calculations at finite isospin density. Finally, we argue that the RG method potentially offers a simpler and more systematic route to higher-order computations of the gap, which are of order $O(g)$ and thus quantitatively important.</description>

      <title>Fully heavy tetraquark states with diquark-antidiquark configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the fully heavy tetraquark state helps to better understand the characteristics of compact exotic hadrons formed by quarks and gluons. In this work, we systematically investigate the mass spectra and decays of fully heavy tetraquark states using a diquark-antidiquark model based on the one gluon exchange process. The tetraquark states are treated as compact diquark-antidiquark configurations, denoted as $[QQ][\bar{Q}\bar{Q}]$, where $Q = c$ or $b$. By properly accounting for the Pauli principle, basis wave functions incorporating flavor, color, and spin are constructed. The required model parameters are derived from fitting conventional hadron experimental values and lattice QCD calculations. We calculate the mass spectra and decays of the fully heavy tetraquarks in the lower $S$- and $P$-waves. Our results do not support interpreting $X(6600)$, $X(6900)$, and $X(7200)$ as $S$-wave fully charmed tetraquark states. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that $X(6600)$ can be a good candidate for the $P$-wave fully charmed tetraquark state. Furthermore, we also identifies several possible fully heavy tetraquark states that may be observable in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exclusive production of a vector-toponium $\psi_t$ state by photon-hadron interactions is investigated considering proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) energies. The scattering amplitude is calculated using the $k_T$-factorization formalism assuming that the vector-toponium state can be described by a Gaussian light-cone wave function and considering different models for the unintegrated gluon distribution. Predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross-sections are presented.</description>

      <title>Implications for Pulsar Timing Arrays of Sub-solar Black Hole Detections: From LVK to Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of compact binary mergers with sub-solar masses at gravitational-wave observatories could mark the groundbreaking discovery of primordial black holes (PBHs). Concurrently, evidence for a nHz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could suggest a non-astrophysical origin, potentially arising from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). In this work, we analyze the connection between the two phenomena in the case where they share a common origin: the collapse of large primordial curvature perturbations in the early universe. We focus on sub-solar PBH populations within reach of upcoming experiments, including the current and future runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as the third generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Using a Bayesian framework with physically motivated priors, we perform a consistent model comparison that incorporates existing astrophysical bounds together with the discovery potential of future detectors. Our analysis lends stronger support for the SIGW interpretation over the astrophysical one, as the narrowed priors place greater weight on the region of highest likelihood. Ultimately, we illustrate that combining PTA data with interferometer searches can deliver correlated evidence for new physics across multiple gravitational-wave bands.</description>

      <title>Lensing by black holes within astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'' corresponding to the peak of the mass distribution can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume analysis and universal scaling signatures near the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantifying the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in QCD through numerical calculations on a discrete space-time lattice, one needs to perform controlled extrapolations to the continuum and infinite-volume limits followed by an extrapolation to the limit of massless light quarks. We discuss here, the results on the latter two limits at still finite lattice spacings. We use here for chiral symmetry breaking, an improved order parameter free of additive and multiplicative divergences and we analyse its volume and quark mass dependence. Comparing to the expected universal behavior in the chiral limit, we quantify deviations from the universal finite-size scaling behavior as function of the light to strange quark mass ratio.</description>

      <title>The nine rings of the galaxy LEDA 1313424</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy LEDA 1313424 has recently been discovered to have nine rings [1]. The authors of the discovery paper interpret the rings to be the result of the passing of a smaller galaxy through the center of the LEDA galaxy 56 Myr ago. We point out several difficulties with this interpretation and propose instead that the rings of LEDA are the imprint upon baryonic matter of caustic rings of dark matter. Caustic rings of dark matter, with the pattern of radii observed in the LEDA galaxy, form if the dark matter is axions. Because they move slowly (LEDA's 70 kpc ring, for example, has speed 6.6 km/s) caustic rings of dark matter are plausible sites for the star formation observed in LEDA.</description>

      <title>Refitting cosmological data with neutrino mass and degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple and natural extension of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is to allow relic neutrinos to have finite chemical potentials. We confront this $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model, a $\Lambda$CDM with neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and degeneracy $\xi_3$ as additional parameters, with various cosmological data sets. We find that the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions become significant only in the presence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization data. Specifically, the global and local measurements agree to within 0.8$\sigma$ and 1.6$\sigma$ for the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, respectively, when the CMB polarization data are not included. Therefore, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions exist between CMB temperature and polarization data, both being global measurements. Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model to the CMB temperature data, we find 3$\sigma$ evidence for nonzero neutrino mass ($M_\nu=0.57^{+0.17}_{-0.13}\,\mathrm{eV}$) and degeneracy ($\xi_3=1.13^{+0.41}_{-0.19}$), and the O(1) neutrino degeneracy parameter is compatible with Big Bang nucleosynthesis data. The scalar index $n_s$ exceeds 1 slightly, which is compatible with some hybrid inflation models. Furthermore, the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data prefer the $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model to the Planck $\Lambda$CDM model. Similar results are obtained when including additional supernova data, while the inclusion of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope $\tau$ prior shifts the preferred $M_\nu$ and $\xi_3$ values closer to zero and brings $n_s$ back to the values favored when the polarization data are included.</description>

      <title>Dimension-eight Operator Basis for Universal Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the basis of dimension-eight operators associated with universal theories. We first derive a complete list of independent dimension-eight operators formed with the Standard Model bosonic fields characteristic of such universal new physics scenarios. Without imposing C or P symmetries the basis contains 175 operators -- that is, the assumption of Universality reduces the number of independent SMEFT coefficients at dimension eight from 44807 to 175. 89 of the 175 universal operators are included in the general dimension-eight operator basis in the literature. The 86 additional operators involve higher derivatives of the Standard Model bosonic fields and can be rotated in favor of operators involving fermions using the Standard Model equations of motion for the bosonic fields. By doing so we obtain the allowed fermionic operators generated in this class of models which we map into the corresponding 86 independent combinations of operators in the dimension-eight basis of Ref. arXiv:2005.00059</description>

Abstract: We study the nonleptonic decays $\bar{B}_s^0 \to D_s^{(*)+} \pi^-$ and $\bar{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+} K^-$ within the Weak Effective Theory (WET) up to mass-dimension six. We revisit the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements within QCD Factorization including the full set of WET operators. We recalculate the two-particle contributions to the hard-scattering kernels at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$, confirming recent results in the literature. We also calculate the three-particle contributions at leading order in $\alpha_s$, clarifying the procedure, refining the SM results in the literature, and providing for the first time the complete set of contributions within the WET. We use these results to perform a global phenomenological study of the effective couplings, putting bounds on the size of the WET Wilson coefficients in four distinct fit models. The fits include constraints from the nonleptonic $B$-meson decay width, which we calculate at the leading order for the full set of WET operators for the first time. This study is the first one to account for simultaneous variation of up to six effective couplings. We identify two distinct modes in all fit models and discuss how future measurements can be used to distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in leptogenesis with sterile neutrino self-interactions</title>

Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are a simple yet compelling addition to the Standard Model. For right-handed neutrinos with masses below the electroweak scale, leptogenesis can proceed through CP-violating oscillations of the sterile neutrinos. This is known as ARS or freeze-in leptogenesis. However, the ARS scenario requires the right-handed neutrinos to have a high degree of mass degeneracy. In this work, we study an extension of the SM that introduces a scalar singlet in addition to the two sterile neutrinos required to generate the baryon asymmetry. The new scalar interacts with the sterile neutrinos via a Yukawa interaction. This leads to an additional rate for the production and destruction of the sterile neutrinos and to a novel contribution to the effective potential. For the case in which the mass and the new Yukawa matrices are not diagonal in the same basis, we find that the effective potential can boost the baryon asymmetry of the universe by several orders of magnitude. This significantly alleviates the fine-tuned mass condition required in vanilla ARS leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Study of $1^{--}$ P wave charmoniumlike and bottomoniumlike tetraquark spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of $1^{--}$ P-wave charmonium-like and bottomonium-like tetraquark states are calculated in a constituent quark model (CQM) where the Cornell-like potential and Breit-Fermi interaction are employed. All model parameters were imported from previous work, and predetermined by studying the low-lying conventional S- and P-wave light, charmed, bottom, charmonium, and bottomonium meson mass spectra. The lowest $1^{--}$ tetraquark mass is predicted to be around 4.15 GeV. The decay widths of $1^{--}$ P-wave tetraquark states are calculated for possible two-body strong decay channels within the rearrangement mechanism, including $\omega \chi_{cJ}$, $\eta J/\psi$, and $\rho J/\psi$ for charmonium-like tetraquarks, and $\omega \chi_{bJ}$ for bottomonium-like tetraquarks. The tetraquark theoretical results are compared with the selected exotic states, also known as Y states, and tentative assignments are suggested. This study suggests that $\psi(4230)$, $\psi(4360)$, $\psi(4660)$, and $\Upsilon$(10753) may be P-wave tetraquark states and that multiple states might exist around 4.36 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the NGAMMA Monte Carlo event generator for QED processes of $e^+e^-$ annihilation into a multiphoton final state, $e^+e^-\to N\gamma (N \ge 2)$. These processes are an important source of background in the study of $e^+e^-\to hadrons$ processes with a multiphoton final state, especially for experiments at low energy $e^+e^-$ colliders like SND, CMD-3, KLOE and for the BESIII experiment. For generation, NGAMMA exploits the exact tree-level amplitude.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decays $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow \Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decays of $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow\Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in all lepton channels. To do this, we first obtain the form factors defining these decay modes within the framework of QCD sum rules. Then, using the transferred momentum squared-dependent form factors, we compute the decay widths and branching fractions for all lepton channels and compare the results of our calculations with those obtained from other theoretical methods. We also estimate the branching ratios and the ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels to provide useful information for future experiments may be planned at different Colliders. Such comparison will provide valuable information about the consistency/inconsistency of the SM theory predictions with experimental data in weak semileptonic single heavy baryon decays.</description>

Abstract: We study the lepton mass textures, which are derived by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We can obtain various textures for the Yukawa couplings in the charged lepton sector, but the patterns of neutrino mass matrices are limited. All the obtained textures can not be realized by group-theoretical symmetries, and certain textures can lead to realistic results.</description>

      <title>Unlocking time-dependent $CP$ violation without signal vertexing at $B$ factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to measure time-dependent $CP$ violation in $B^0$ decays produced in $\Upsilon(4S) \to B^0\overline{B}^0$ events at $B$ factories without reconstructing the signal decay vertex. The method exploits the sensitivity of the tag $\overline{B}^0$ decay time to $CP$ violation in the $B^0$ signal. It relies on a compact $e^+e^-$ interaction region and excellent vertex resolution, which enable precise measurement of the displacement between production and decay vertices of the tag meson. We study an application to $B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$ decays using a simplified simulation that approximates the conditions of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider. Our approach achieves a sensitivity on mixing-induced $CP$ violation that would require 20 times larger samples with standard approaches. When incorporated into the $B \to \pi\pi$ isospin analysis, the expected results would reduce the degeneracy of $\phi_2$ solutions and significantly increase precision. This work opens a path to previously inaccessible $CP$-violation studies enhancing and accelerating the reach of Belle II and future flavor physics programs.</description>

      <title>Measuring black hole spin through gravitational lensing of pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new procedure for measuring the spin of a black hole with an unprecedented accuracy based on the gravitational lensing of millisecond pulsars. We derive the basic equations for lensing by a rotating black hole. We show that the frame dragging effect increases the deflection angle of a light ray co-rotating with the black hole. For the primary (secondary) images the angular positions are larger (smaller) for a rotating black hole by an amount on the order of tens of microarcseconds. The differential time delay of images for the case in which the lens is a rotating black hole is smaller than that in the case of non-rotating lens of the same mass, and it can be larger than a few milliseconds. We show that this quantity offers the possibility of reducing the error of spin measurement to less than one percent if we could measure the differential time delay with accuracy of microseconds. We also study relativistic images that are produced by light rays that rotate around the black hole before reaching the observer. The angular positions of relativistic images on the same side as the primary (secondary) image are a few microarcseconds larger (smaller) if the black hole is rotating. Furthermore, the differential time delay between relativistic images is about twelve orders of magnitude larger in the case of rotating lens.</description>

      <title>Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Truncations of SU($N_c$) Lattice Gauge Theory for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

Abstract: The hypothesis of the factorization of the double nuclear modification factor in relativistic heavy ion collisions is tested for different types of final-state hadrons within the HYDJET++ model. The results demonstrate that this factorization holds reasonably well at moderately high transverse momenta, provided that the effects of double parton scattering can be small or neglected.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Origin of Primordial Black Holes: A Viable Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.</description>
