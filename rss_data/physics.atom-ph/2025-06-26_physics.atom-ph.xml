      <title>Theoretical study of transition energies and matrix elements of the cadmium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic Fock-space coupled-cluster methods are applied to the cadmium atom. A large number of transition energies and matrix elements are calculated for the $5s^{2}\:$$ ^{1}S \to 5snp\: ^{1,3} P^{o}$, $5s6s\: ^{1}S \to 5snp\: ^{1,3} P^{o}$ and $5s5d\: ^{1}D \to 5snp\: ^{1,3} P^{o}$ transitions for a wide range of $p$ states accounting for relativistic and electron-correlation effects. The results obtained within two different approaches (Fock-space coupled cluster and configuration interaction) are compared with available experimental and theoretical data. Good agreement is found between the two methods for transitions involving low-lying excited $p$-states, whereas for high-lying states, the discrepancy becomes large. The calculated values are used to determine the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of cadmium vapor, with an agreement within 5\% between the different methods. The results of the present computations support the feasibility of generating vacuum ultraviolet light in Cd vapor via a four-wave mixing process for the spectroscopy of $^{229}$Th isomer transition.</description>

      <title>IKEBANA: A Neural-Network approach for the K-shell ionization by electron impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully connected neural network was trained to model the K-shell ionization cross sections based on two input features: the atomic number and the incoming electron overvoltage. The training utilized a recent, updated compilation of experimental data, covering elements from H to U, and incident electron energies ranging from the threshold to relativistic values. The neural network demonstrated excellent predictive performance, compared with the experimental data, when available, and with full theoretical predictions. The developed model is provided in the ikebana code, which is openly available and requires only the user-selected atomic number and electron energy range as inputs.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic effect in high order harmonic generation revealed by a fully analytical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully analytical method for describing high-order harmonic generation (HHG). This method is based on the strong-field approximation (SFA) and utilizes the perturbation expansion method. Specifically, we expand the laser-induced dipole moment to third-order analytical expansion (TAE) and fifth-order expansion (FAE) with respect to the Keldysh parameter $\gamma$. The TAE method is suitable for $\gamma\leqslant0.27$, while the FAE method can be applied for $\gamma\leqslant 0.65$. We demonstrate that higher-order perturbation terms capture the nonadiabatic effect, while the zero-order term represents the adiabatic effect. Furthermore, we reveal that the nonadiabatic effect influences HHG intensity by impacting electron dynamics.</description>

      <title>A digital twin of atomic ensemble quantum memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate performance estimation of experimentally demonstrated quantum memories is key to understand the nuances in their deployment in photonic quantum networks. While several software packages allow for accessible quantum simulation, they often do not account for the loss and noise in physical devices. We present a framework for modeling ensemble-based atomic quantum memories using the quantum channel formalism. We provide a Kraus matrix representation of several experimentally implemented state-of-the art quantum memories and give an overview of their most important performance metrics. To showcase the applicability of this approach, we implement a memory-assisted quantum token protocol within our simulation framework. Our digital twin model is readily extensible to other memory implementations and easily compatible with existing frameworks for performance simulation of experimental quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Super-resolving frequency measurement with mode-selective quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve spectral features narrower than their bandwidth. Here, we introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light-matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. For the task of estimating the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity as small as 1/20 of the linewidth with up to a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced resolution of frequency measurements, combined with the memory's capability of on-demand storage, retrieval and mode conversion, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Continuous operation of a coherent 3,000-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms are a promising platform for quantum science, enabling advances in areas ranging from quantum simulations and computation to metrology, atomic clocks and quantum networking. While atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation could significantly enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology, and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction. Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate, continuous reloading and operation of a large-scale atom array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave the way for realization of large-scale continuously operated atomic clocks, sensors, and fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Architectural mechanisms of a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is believed to be essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded `logical' qubits, understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement all key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors, demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery, and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes, enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with logarithmic overhead. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use, increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic and entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates and magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality and physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems.</description>

      <title>Ultracold Interactions between Ions and Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a platform for observing and controlling the interactions between atomic ions and a quantum gas of polar molecules in the ultracold regime. This approach is based on the combination of several recently developed methods in two so-far complementary research domains: ion-atom collisions and studies of ultracold polar molecules. In contrast to collisions between ions and ground-state atoms, which are dominated by losses due to three-body recombination (TBR) already at densities far below those typical for quantum degenerate ensembles, our proposal makes use of polar molecules, their rich level structure, and sensitivity to electric fields to design effective interaction potentials where ion-neutral TBR losses and molecule-molecule losses due to sticky collisions could be strongly suppressed. This may open a broad range of applications including precise control of collisional properties in molecular ensembles using ions, quantum simulations, and cold quantum chemistry between polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Nitrogen-Cooled Ca+ Ion Optical Clock with a Systematic Uncertainty of 4.6E-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.6E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <title>New Atomic Orbital Functions.Complete and Orthonormal Sets of ETOs with Non-integer Quantum Numbers.Results for He-like atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock-Rothaan equations are solved for He-like ions using the iterative self-consistent method. New complete and orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals are employed as the basis. These orbitals satisfy the orthonormality condition for quantum numbers with fractional power. They are solutions of a Schrodinger-like differential equation derived by the authors. In a recent study conducted for the calculation of the hydrogen atom energy levels, it has been demonstrated that the fractional formalism of the principal and the angular momentum quantum numbers converges to the 1s level of the ground state energy of hydrogen atom, obtained from the solution of the standard Schrodinger equation. This study examines the effect of fractional values of the quantum numbers for two-electron systems, which is the simplest system with electron correlation effects.</description>
