      <title>A Unified Formulation for $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle $ in Two-Component TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-component linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) provides a unified framework that encompasses noncollinear excitations in noncollinear reference states, as well as both spin-conserving and spin-flip excitations in collinear reference states. In this work, we present a general formalism for evaluating the expectation value $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ of electronically excited states obtained within two-component TDDFT. We then derive and analyze specialized forms of the resulting equations for collinear reference determinants, for which the two-component formalism decomposes into conventional spin-conserving and spin-flip TDDFT. The resulting working equations are systematically compared with previously proposed theoretical approaches. On the basis of our analysis, $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ in the excited states is shown to arise from two distinct sources: (i) $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle_0$ in the reference state and (ii) additional $\Delta\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ introduced by the excitation process itself. Finally, we evaluate the expectation value $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ by performing two-component TDDFT calculations based on two-component DFT, unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS), and restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) reference states, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fragment-Based Configuration Interaction: Towards a Unifying Description of Biexcitonic Processes in Molecular Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biexcitonic states govern singlet fission, triplet-triplet and exciton-exciton annihilation, yet a unified understanding of how these processes compete within a shared electronic manifold remains elusive. We outline a conceptual framework based on fragment-based configuration-interaction that systematically constructs diabatic Hamiltonians spanning the full one-particle (LE, CT) and two-particle (LELE, CTCT, TT, CTX with X = LE, CT, or T) manifolds from monomer-local building blocks, preserving physical interpretability throughout. SymbolicCI provides analytic Hamiltonian matrix elements for efficient large-scale calculations; NOCI-F delivers benchmark-quality couplings. The resulting diabatic Hamiltonians can be coupled to quantum dynamics simulations. Applications to ethylene aggregates and the anthracene crystal reveal CTX configurations as electronic gateways bridging excitonic manifolds, with CT-mediated relaxation pathways competing with conventional annihilation. In H-type aggregates, LECT admixture stabilizes a "bi-excimer" analogous to one-particle excimers. By providing first-principles access to biexciton formation, separation, and transport, we hope to stimulate further exchange between electronic structure and quantum dynamics communities toward a predictive understanding of multiexcitonic photophysics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced acceleration of inter-ligand exciton transfer in bis(dipyrrinato)Zn(II) complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton transfer dynamics between chromophores depends on excitonic coupling, which is governed by relative orientation between the chromophores. While the excitonic coupling is treated as a static parameter in many cases, structural dynamics can introduce time-dependence on the excitonic coupling. However, influence of the dynamics of excitonic coupling on the exciton transfer has been scarcely understood. In the present study, exciton transfer under dynamical fluctuation in excitonic coupling was investigated via combined use of non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, exciton density analysis, and a simple two-state model, for inter-ligand exciton transfer in bis(dipyrrinato)Zn(II) as the example case. The reaction coordinate for the exciton transfer was obtained a posteriori via regression analysis where the target and explanatory variables are diabatic energy gaps and atomic displacements, respectively. The results suggest that dynamical angular fluctuation between the two dipyrrinato ligands incidentally increase the excitonic coupling, accelerating the exciton transfer between the ligands.</description>

      <title>Hidden universality in dislocation-loops mediated three-dimensional crystal melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding why and how crystalline solids melt remains a central problem in condensed-matter physics. Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data. The same framework also rationalizes the empirical $2/3$ rule relating the glass-transition and melting temperatures.</description>

      <title>Continuous and discontinuous realizations of first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions are commonly associated with a discontinuous behavior of some of the thermodynamic variables and the presence of a latent heat. In the present study it is shown that this is not necessarily the case. Using standard thermodynamics, the general characteristics of phase transitions are investigated, considering an arbitrary number of conserved particle species and coexisting phases, and an arbitrary set of state variables. It is found that there exist two different possible types of realizations of a phase transition. In the first type, one has the immediate replacement of a single phase with another one. As a consequence, some of the global extensive variables indeed behave discontinuously. In the second type, one has instead the gradual (dis-) appearance of a single phase over a range of the state variables. This leads to a continuous behavior of the (global) basic thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, in this case it is not possible to define a latent heat in a trivial manner. It is derived that the latter (former) case happens if the number of extensive state variables used is larger or equal (lower) than the number of coexisting phases. The choice of the state variables thus place a crucial role for the qualitative properties of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>On the Coupled Cluster Doubles Truncation Variety of Four Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend recent algebro-geometric results for coupled cluster theory of quantum many-body systems to the truncation varieties arising from the doubles approximation (CCD), focusing on the first genuinely nonlinear doubles regime of four electrons. Since this doubles truncation variety does not coincide with previously studied varieties, we initiate a systematic investigation of its basic algebro-geometric invariants. Combining theoretical and numerical results, we show that for $4$ electrons on $n\leq 12$ orbitals, the CCD truncation variety is a complete intersection of degree $2^{\binom{n-4}{4}}$. Using representation-theoretic arguments, we uncover a Pfaffian structure governing the quadratic relations that define the truncation variety for any $n$, and show that an exact tensor product factorization holds in a distinguished limit of disconnected doubles. We connect these structural results to the computation of the beryllium insertion into molecular hydrogen ({Be$\cdots$H$_2$ $\to$ H--Be--H}), a small but challenging bond formation process where multiconfigurational effects become pronounced.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Diffusion Sampling: Efficient Rare Event Sampling and Free Energy Calculation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $\Delta$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction via interpolative separable density fitting with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $O(N^3)$ and $O(N^2)$ with arbitrary basis, respectively, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Brownian dynamics simulations of electric double-layer capacitors with tunable metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient description of electrodes, characterized by their Thomas-Fermi screening length lTF inside the metal, for Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of capacitors. Within a Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the electron charge density inside the electrodes, we derive the effective many-body potential for ions in an implicit solvent between Thomas-Fermi electrodes, taking into account the constraints of applied voltage and of global electro-neutrality of the system, as well as the 2D periodic boundary conditions along the electrode surfaces. We derive the average charge and the fluctuation-dissipation relation for the differential capacitance, highlighting the contribution of the fluctuations of the net ionic dipole moment, as well as those from the solvent polarization and of the electron density, whose fluctuations are suppressed within the Born-Oppenheimer description. We demonstrate the relevance of this model by validating its predictions against known results for the force on ions as a function of the ion-surface distance in simple geometries. The equilibrium ionic density profiles from BD simulations are in excellent agreement with those from an explicit electrode model for perfect metals, and are obtained at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we discuss with the present model the effect of the Thomas-Fermi screening length on the equilibrium ionic density profiles and the capacitance. While limited to parallel plate capacitors, the present simulation method allows to consider larger systems, lower concentrations, and longer time scales concentrations than molecular simulations in order to predict the electrochemical properties of Thomas-Fermi capacitors and correlate them with the ion dynamics.</description>

      <title>A CPD-enabled low-scaling environment solver in a coupled cluster based static quantum embedding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We incorporate a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) based low-level solver as a means to accelerate the environment-level solver for the recently developed MPCC embedding framework. Using CPD, we both factorize the three dominant order-three density-fitting two-electron integral (DF TEI) tensors and develop a novel formulation that reduces the storage complexity of the low-level solver from ${O}(N^3)$ to $O(NR)$, where $R$ is the CPD rank, and the computational scaling of the most time-consuming contractions from ${O}(N^4)$ to ${O}(NR^2)$. We provide benchmarks on representative chemical environments, namely water clusters $\mathrm{{(H_2O)_n}}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$ and linear alkane chains $\mathrm{{C_nH_{2n+2}}}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$. For both test sets, using the CPD-compressed DF TEI tensors reproduces the DF reference convergence behavior of the low-level solver, the subsequent high-level step, and the fully self-consistent MPCC iterations, while introducing only small, rank-controlled shifts in absolute energies. At a fixed tolerance in the absolute MPCC energy, the CP ranks required for these tensor approximations increase linearly with system size. Chemically relevant energy differences are likewise preserved, as demonstrated for water-cluster dissociation energies and in a proof-of-concept embedding calculation of methane in a four-water cluster.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in quantum chemistry, correlated materials, atomic physics, molecular dynamics, and quantum sensing.</description>
