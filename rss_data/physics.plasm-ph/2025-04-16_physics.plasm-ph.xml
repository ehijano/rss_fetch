      <title>A relativistic model for Quantum Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model to study the dynamics of relativistic quantum plasmas using the quantum electrodynamical (QED) approach has been constructed to analyze the quantum effects, relativistic corrections, and electromagnetic interactions. Considering the covariant Lagrangian function and EulerLagrange equation, the equations of motion have been established describing the interaction of strong electromagnetic waves in plasma. These equations of motion constitute a model for the propagation of relativistic laser pulse through high density quantum plasma. Our model specifically takes the effects of four spin and four velocity into account during the interaction process. This model is applicable to high density plasmas in all ranges of electromagnetic fields which includes astrophysical environments, high power laser plasma interactions, etc.</description>

      <title>TorbeamNN: Machine learning based steering of ECH mirrors on KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed TorbeamNN: a machine learning surrogate model for the TORBEAM ray tracing code to predict electron cyclotron heating and current drive locations in tokamak plasmas. TorbeamNN provides more than a 100 times speed-up compared to the highly optimized and simplified real-time implementation of TORBEAM without any reduction in accuracy compared to the offline, full fidelity TORBEAM code. The model was trained using KSTAR electron cyclotron heating (ECH) mirror geometries and works for both O-mode and X-mode absorption. The TorbeamNN predictions have been validated both offline and real-time in experiment. TorbeamNN has been utilized to track an ECH absorption vertical position target in dynamic KSTAR plasmas as well as under varying toroidal mirror angles and with a minimal average tracking error of 0.5cm.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of single microdischarges during plasma electrolytic oxidation of aluminium and titanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is a technique used to create oxide-ceramic coatings on lightweight metals, such as aluminium, magnesium, and titanium. PEO is known for producing coatings with high corrosion resistance and strong adhesion to the substrate. The process involves generating short-lived microdischarges on the material surface through anodic dielectric breakdown in a conductive aqueous solution. To investigate single microdischarges during PEO, a single microdischarge setup was developed, where the active anode surface is reduced to the tip of a wire with a diameter of 1 mm. In this work the focus is on the effect of electrolyte concentration, anode material, and electrical parameters on the microdischarges. The electrolyte is composed of distilled water with varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide (0.5 - 4 g/l). High-speed optical measurements are conducted to gain insights into the formation and temporal evolution of individual microdischarges and the induced gas bubble formation. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to estimate surface and electron temperatures by fitting Bremsstrahlung and Planck's law to the continuum spectrum of the microdischarges. To evaluate the impact of the microdischarges on coating morphology, the resulting oxide layers on the metal tips are analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The study demonstrates that microdischarge behaviour is significantly influenced by the substrate material, treatment time, and electrolyte concentration, all of which impact the coating morphology. Under the conditions studied in this work, aluminium exhibits longer microdischarge and bubble lifetimes, with fewer cracks on the top layer of the coating, whereas titanium showed faster, shorter-lived bubbles due to more rapid microdischarge events.</description>

      <title>Short-range ordering and equilibrium structure of binary crystal mixtures of atomic nuclei in white dwarf cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of bare atomic nuclei on a nearly uniform degenerate electron background are a realistic model of matter in the interior of white dwarfs. Despite tremendous progress in understanding their phase diagrams achieved mainly via first-principle simulations, structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of such mixtures are poorly understood. We develop a semi-analytic model of the crystal state of binary mixtures based on the concept of mutual short-range ordering of ions of different sorts. We derive analytic formulas for electrostatic energy of crystal mixtures, including the effect of static ion displacements from the lattice nodes, and estimate their residual entropy. Then we perform free energy minimization with respect to the order parameters for a C/O mixture at all relevant compositions and temperatures. The resulting C/O phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with that obtained in the most recent first-principle study. The equilibrium microstructure of a crystallized mixture is shown to evolve with decrease of temperature which, in principle, can induce structural transitions. The latter will be accompanied by thermal energy release. The proposed theory opens up a path to analyze ordering and construct phase diagrams of ternary mixtures, which are of great practical interest in astrophysics, as well as to improve calcuations of electron-ion scattering rates and kinetic properties of dense crystallized matter.</description>

      <title>Extended scenarios for solar radio emissions with downshifted electron beam plasma excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principle studies of radiative processes aimed at explaining the origin of type II and type III solar radio bursts raise questions on the implications of downshifted electron beam plasma excitations with frequency (slightly) below the plasma frequency ($\omega\lesssim\omega_{pe}$) in the generation of radio emissions. Unlike the beam-induced Langmuir waves ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) in the standard radio emission plasma model, the primary wave excitations of cooler and/or denser beams have predominantly downshifted frequencies. Broadbands of such downshifted excitations are also confirmed by in situ observations in association with terrestrial foreshock and electron beams (in contrast to narrowband Langmuir waves), but their involvement in radiative processes has not been examined so far. We revisit three radiative scenarios specific to downshifted primary excitations, and the results demonstrate their direct or indirect involvement in plasma radio emission. Downshifted excitations of an electron beam primarily play an indirect role, contributing to the relaxation to a plateau-on-tail still able to induce Langmuir beam waves that satisfy conditions for nonlinear wave-wave interactions leading to free radio waves. At longer time scales, the primary excitations can become predominantly downshifted, and then directly couple with the secondary (backscattered) Langmuir waves to generate the second harmonic of radio emissions. Two counterbeams are more efficient and lead to faster radiative mechanisms, involving counterpropagating downshifted excitations, which couple to each other and generate intense, broadband and isotropic radio spectra of downshifted second harmonics. Such a long-lasting (second) radio harmonic can thus be invoked to distinguish regimes with downshifted ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) primary excitations.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ well-known concepts from statistical physics, quantum field theories and general topology to study magnetic reconnection, topology-change and their connection in incompressible flows in the context of an effective field theory without appealing to magnetic field lines. We consider the dynamical system corresponding to wave-packets moving with Alfven velocity dx/dt=V_A whose trajectories x(t) define path lines, which naturally provides a mathematical way to estimate the rate of magnetic topology-change. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of path lines at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, argued to correspond to slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, path lines diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent dissipation with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. In fact, due to the loss of Lipschitz continuity of magnetic field in turbulence, path lines separate super-linearly even if their initial separation tends to vanish, unlike deterministic chaos. This super-chaotic behavior is an example of spontaneous stochasticity in statistical physics, sometimes called the real butterfly effect in chaos theory to distinguish it from the butterfly effect in which trajectories can diverge exponentially only if initial separation remains finite. If 3D reconnection is defined as magnetic topology-change, it can be fast only in turbulence where both reconnection and topology-change are driven by spontaneous stochasticity, independent of any plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac theory of turbulent reconnection.</description>

      <title>Radiated energy fraction of SPI-induced disruptions at ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future large tokamaks will operate at high plasma currents and high stored plasma energies. To ensure machine protection in case of a sudden loss of plasma confinement (major disruption), a large fraction of the magnetic and thermal energy must be radiated to reduce thermal loads. The disruption mitigation system for ITER is based on massive material injection in the form of shattered pellet injection (SPI). To support ITER, a versatile SPI system was installed at the tokamak ASDEX Upgrade (AUG). The AUG SPI features three independent pellet generation cells and guide tubes, and each was equipped with different shatter heads for the 2022 experimental campaign. We dedicated over 200 plasma discharges to the study of SPI plasma termination, and in this manuscript report on the results of bolometry (total radiation) analysis. The amount of neon inside the pellets is the dominant factor determining the radiated energy fraction ($f_{rad}$). Large and fast fragments, produced by the 12.5{\deg} rectangular shatter head, lead to somewhat higher values of frad compared to the 25{\deg} circular or rectangular heads. This effect is strongest for neon content of $&lt; 3\times10^{20}$ neon atoms ($f_\textrm{neon} \lesssim 1.25\%$ neon) injected, where a lower normal velocity component (larger fragments) seems slightly beneficial. While full-sized, 8 mm diameter, 100% deuterium ($D_2$) pellets lead to a disruption, the 4 mm or shortened 8 mm pellets of 100% $D_2$ did not. The disruption threshold for 100% $D_2$ is found to be around $1\times10^{22}$ $D_2$ molecules inside the pellet. While the radiated energy fraction of non-disruptive SPI is below 20%, this is increased to 40% during the TQ and VDE phase of the disruptive injections. For ($D_2$-Ne-mix pellets, frad values of $&lt; 90$% are observed, and the curve saturates around 80% for 10% neon mixed into the 8 mm pellets ($2\times10^{21}$ neon atoms).</description>
