      <title>Probing Ultralight Dark Matter at the Mega-Planck Scale with the Thorium Nuclear Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter is expected to induce oscillations of nuclear parameters. These oscillations are characterized by extremely weak couplings or high suppression scales, with the Planck scale - the characteristic scale of quantum gravity - serving as a natural benchmark. Probing this phenomenon requires systems with exceptional sensitivity to shifts in nuclear energies. The uniquely low-energy nuclear isomeric transition in ${}^{229}$Th provides such sensitivity: it directly probes the nuclear interaction and, owing to a near cancellation between electromagnetic and nuclear contributions, its response to changes in nuclear structure is greatly amplified. We devise and perform a new type of ultrasensitive search for dark matter which uses the precision nuclear spectroscopy at JILA to set the strongest bounds in the mass range $10^{-21}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 10^{-19}\,{\rm eV}$. Our results probe effective interaction scales exceeding $10^6$ times the Planck scale (the Mega-Planck scale) and establish the ${}^{229}$Th system as the leading probe of dark matter couplings to the nuclear sector.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Endcap Time-of-Flight detector in the STAR beam-energy scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory completed the installation of an endcap time-of-flight subsystem (eTOF) in February 2019. The eTOF subsystem provided essential mid-rapidity particle identification (PID) for the fixed-target (FXT) portion of phase II of the beam energy scan (BES II). The FXT program allowed BES II to include center-of-mass energies from $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 3.0$ GeV to $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 7.7$ GeV, not accessible by colliding beams. The eTOF detectors and readout electronics were designed for the CBM experiment at FAIR and adapted for use at STAR. In this paper, we describe the details of the system in terms of geometrical layout, acceptance, calibration, hit reconstruction, and particle identification. The system achieved a time resolution of about 70 ps and a PID efficiency of about 70\%, meeting the design goals of the project.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Multimodal Superfluidity of Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental evidence for a new phase of matter in neutron-rich systems that we call multimodal superfluidity. Using ab initio lattice calculations, we show that the condensate consists of coexisting s-wave pairs, p-wave pairs in entangled double pair combinations, and quartets composed of bound states of two s-wave pairs. We identify multimodal superfluidity as a general feature of single-flavor spin-1/2 fermionic systems with attractive s-wave and p-wave interactions, provided the system is stable against collapse into a dense droplet. Beyond neutrons at sub-saturation densities, we demonstrate that this phase appears in generalized attractive extended Hubbard models in one, two, and three dimensions. We elucidate the mechanism for this coexistence using self-consistent few-body Cooper models and compare with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. We also derive the form of the effective action and show that spin, rotational, and parity symmetries remain unbroken. Finally, we analyze experimental data to show that p-wave pair gaps and quartet gaps are present in atomic nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of this new phase for the structure and dynamics of neutron star crusts.</description>

      <title>Long-range transverse momentum correlations and radial flow in Pb$-$Pb collisions at the LHC with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents measurements of long-range transverse-momentum correlations using a new observable, $v_{0}(p_\mathrm{T})$, serving as a probe of event-by-event radial-flow fluctuations, the underlying radial expansion, and the medium properties in heavy-ion collisions. Results are reported for inclusive charged particles, pions, kaons, and protons across various centrality intervals in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, recorded by the ALICE detector. A pseudorapidity-gap technique, similar to that used in anisotropic-flow studies, is employed to suppress short-range correlations. At low $p_\mathrm{T}$, a characteristic mass ordering consistent with hydrodynamic collective flow is observed. At higher $p_\mathrm{T}$ ($&gt; 3$ GeV/$c$), protons exhibit larger $v_{0}(p_\mathrm{T})$ than pions and kaons, in agreement with expectations from quark-recombination models. Comparisons to viscous hydrodynamic calculations with varying bulk viscosity and equation of state demonstrate the sensitivity of the $v_{0}(p_\mathrm{T})$ observable to these key medium properties. The findings establish $v_{0}(p_\mathrm{T})$ as a valuable addition to the set of observables used in Bayesian analyses for extracting the transport properties and constraining the equation of state of strongly interacting matter, while also helping to systematically explore its sensitivity and impact within such global studies.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects in an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universality of electric charge as a quantum number allows thermoelectric properties to manifest across diverse systems, starting from a hot quantum chromodynamic matter in heavy-ion collisions at a high energy scale to semiconductors in condensed matter systems at a low energy scale. In this work, we explore the emergence of magneto-transport phenomena, specifically the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects, in a hot and dense hadronic medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies. These phenomena arise due to the combined influence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential, particularly in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic medium considering different frameworks of hadron resonance gas models. The presence of external magnetic fields breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric transport coefficient matrix, giving rise to new components of the Thomson coefficient, namely, magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients, which originate from the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck coefficient and Nernst coefficient, respectively, in hadron gas under the influence of a static and time-varying magnetic field. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the higher-order thermoelectric properties of the hot and dense hadronic medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$ with a Skyrme pseudopotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed density-, momentum- and isospin-dependent N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron--proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core--crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</description>
