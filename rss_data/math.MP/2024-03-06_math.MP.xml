      <title>Edge states for tight-binding operators with soft walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one- and two-dimensional periodic tight-binding models under the presence of a potential that grows to infinity in one direction, hence preventing the particles to escape in this direction (the soft wall). We prove that a spectral flow appears in these corresponding edge models, as the wall is shifted. We identity this flow as a number of Bloch bands, and provide a lower bound for the number of edge states appearing in such models.</description>

      <title>Arctic curves of the T-system with Slanted Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

      <title>Subalgebras of Lie algebras. Example of sl(3,R) revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revisiting the results by Winternitz [Symmetry in physics, CRM Proc. Lecture Notes 34, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004, pp. 215-227], we thoroughly refine his classification of Lie subalgebras of the real order-three special linear Lie algebra and thus present the correct version of this classification for the first time. A similar classification over the complex numbers is also carried out. We follow the general approach by Patera, Winternitz and Zassenhaus but in addition enhance it and rigorously prove its theoretical basis for the required specific cases of classifying subalgebras of real or complex finite-dimensional Lie algebras. As a byproduct, we first construct complete lists of inequivalent subalgebras of the rank-two affine Lie algebra over both the real and complex fields.</description>

      <title>Existence of de Almeida-Thouless-type instability in the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpolation method for mean field spin glass models developed by Guerra and Talagrand is extended to a quantum mean field spin glass model. This extension enables us to obtain both replica-symmetric (RS) and one step replica-symmetry breaking (1RSB) solutions of the free energy density in the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. It is shown that the RS solution is exact in the paramagnetic phase. We provide a sufficient condition on coupling constants where the 1RSB solution gives better bound than the RS one. This condition reduced to physical quantities in disordered single spin systems allows a simple computer-assisted proof for the existence of the de Almeida-Thouless-type instability.</description>

      <title>Refining the grading of irreducible Lie colour algebra representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the refining extension of representations for Lie colour algebras which simultaneously extends the representations and refines the grading to a larger grading group.We show that the refining extension provides a general method for deriving all finite-dimensional irreducible Lie colour algebra representations from those for Lie superalgebras. This method yields a bijection between equivalence classes but, despite this, Lie colour algebras maintain a non-trivial representation theory distinct from that of Lie superalgebras. We expect this result to be useful for the many applications of Lie colour algebras that make use of irreducible representations. In addition, we show that the refining extension provides a natural way to construct the Hilbert space realisation for colour algebra quantum-mechanical models by giving an example that has previously appeared in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the pole-free regions of the one-parameter family of special solutions of P$_\mathrm{II}$, the second Painlev\'e equation, constructed from the Airy functions. This is achieved by exploiting the connection between these solutions and the recurrence coefficients of orthogonal polynomials that appear in the analysis of the ensemble of random matrices corresponding to the cubic potential.</description>

      <title>Some solutions to the eigenstate equation of free scalar quantum field theory in the Schr\"odinger representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using extensions of the quadratic form in the potential term we construct Gaussian eigenstates of the free scalar quantum Hamiltonian operator acting in nontrivial functional space. Admissible positive closed extensions are generated at least by two external sources, the distance between them being limited by the extension parameter. The constructed functionals, in contrast to the ground state of the free theory, correspond to different boundary conditions and can be interpreted as eigenstates of some renormalized asymptotically free quantum Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>On A Tautological Relation Conjectured By Buryak-Shadrin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buryak and Shadrin conjectured a tautological relation on moduli spaces of curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ which has the form $B^m_{g, \textbf{d}}=0$ for certain tautological classes $B^m_{g, \textbf{d}}$ where $m \geq 2, n \geq 1$ and $|\textbf{d}| \geq 2g+m-1$. In this paper we prove that this conjecture holds if it is true for the $m=2$ and $|\textbf{d}| = 2g+1$ case. This result reduces the proof of this conjecture to checking finitely many cases for each genus $g$. We will also prove this conjecture for the $g=1$ case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic run time advantage for all algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of computer called a quantum frequential computer. They harness quantum properties in a different way to conventional quantum computers to generate a quadratic computational run time advantage for all algorithms as a function of the power consumed. They come in two variants: type 1 can process classical algorithms only while type 2 can also process quantum ones. In a type-1 quantum frequential computer, only the control is quantum, while in a type 2 the logical space is also quantum. We also prove that a quantum frequential computer only requires a classical data bus to function. This is useful, because it means that only a relatively small part of the overall architecture of the computer needs to be quantum in a type-1 quantum frequential computer in order to achieve a quadratic run time advantage. As with classical and conventional quantum computers, quantum frequential computers also generate heat and require cooling. We also characterise these requirements.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence for Vertex Operator Superalgebras from Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

      <title>Boundary Behavior of Compact Manifolds With Scalar Curvature Lower Bounds and Static Quasi-Local Mass of Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classic result of Shi and Tam states that a 2-sphere of positive Gauss and mean curvature bounding a compact 3-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature, must have total mean curvature not greater than that of the isometric embedding into Euclidean 3-space, with equality only for domains in this reference manifold. We generalize this result to 2-tori of Guass curvature greater than $-1$, which bound a compact 3-manifold having scalar curvature not less than $-6$ and at least one other boundary component satisfying a 'trapping condition'. The conclusion is that the total weighted mean curvature is not greater than that of an isometric embedding into the Kottler manifold, with equality only for domains in this space. Examples are given to show that the assumption of a secondary boundary component cannot be removed. The result gives a positive mass theorem for the static Brown-York mass of tori, in analogy to the Shi-Tam positivity of the standard Brown-York mass, and represents the first such quasi-local mass positivity result for non-spherical surfaces. Furthermore, we prove a Penrose-type inequality in this setting.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Networking: Some Tools and Protocols for Ideal and Noisy Photonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking at many scales will be critical to future quantum technologies and experiments on quantum systems. Photonic links enable quantum networking. They will connect co-located quantum processors to enable large-scale quantum computers, provide links between distant quantum computers to support distributed, delegated, and blind quantum computing, and will link distant nodes in space enabling new tests of fundamental physics. Here, we discuss recent work advancing photonic tools and protocols that support quantum networking. We provide analytical results and numerics for the effect of distinguishability errors on key photonic circuits; we considered a variety of error models and developed new metrics for benchmarking the quality of generated photonic states. We review a distillation protocol by one of the authors that mitigates distinguishability errors. We also review recent results by a subset of the authors on the efficient simulation of photonic circuits via approximation by coherent states. We study some interactions between the theory of universal sets, unitary t-designs, and photonics: while many of the results we state in this direction may be known to experts, we aim to bring them to the attention of the broader quantum information science community and to phrase them in ways that are more familiar to this community. We prove, translating a result from representation theory, that there are no non-universal infinite closed $2$-designs in $U(V)$ when $\dim V \geq 2$. As a consequence, we observe that linear optical unitaries form a $1$-design but not a 2-design. Finally, we apply a result of Oszmaniec and Zimbor\'{a}s to prove that augmenting the linear optical unitaries with any nontrivial SNAP gate is sufficient to achieve universality.</description>

Abstract: In this thesis we study classical aspects of superconformal field theory via symmetry principles. Specifically, by employing the powerful setup of conformal superspace, we obtain a plethora of new results in the fields of geometric and higher symmetries, (super)conformal higher-spin theory and conformal supergravity. These findings open up numerous novel research pathways.</description>

      <title>The height gap of planar Brownian motion is $\frac{5}{\pi}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the occupation measure of planar Brownian motion exhibits a constant height gap of $5/\pi$ across its outer boundary. This property bears similarities with the celebrated results of Schramm--Sheffield [18] and Miller--Sheffield [12] concerning the height gap of the Gaussian free field across SLE$_4$/CLE$_4$ curves. Heuristically, our result can also be thought of as the $\theta \to 0^+$ limit of the height gap property of a field built out of a Brownian loop soup with subcritical intensity $\theta&gt;0$, proved in our recent paper [3]. To obtain the explicit value of the height gap, we rely on the computation by Garban and Trujillo Ferreras [1] of the expected area of the domain delimited by the outer boundary of a Brownian bridge.</description>

      <title>Critical magnetic flux for Weyl points in the three-dimensional Hofstadter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the band structure of the three-dimensional Hofstadter model on cubic lattices, with an isotropic magnetic field oriented along the diagonal of the cube with flux $\Phi=2 \pi \cdot m /n$, where $m,n$ are co-prime integers. Using reduced exact diagonalization in momentum space, we show that, at fixed $m$, there exists an integer $n(m)$ associated with a specific value of the magnetic flux, that we denote by $\Phi_c(m) \equiv 2 \pi \cdot m/n(m)$, separating two different regimes. The first one, for fluxes $\Phi&lt;\Phi_c(m)$, is characterized by complete band overlaps, while the second one, for $\Phi&gt;\Phi_c(m)$, features isolated band touching points in the density of states and Weyl points between the $m$- and the $(m+1)$-th bands. In the Hasegawa gauge, the minimum of the $(m+1)$-th band abruptly moves at the critical flux $\Phi_c(m)$ from $k_z=0$ to $k_z=\pi$. We then argue that the limit for large $m$ of $\Phi_c(m)$ exists and it is finite: $\lim_{m\to \infty} \Phi_c(m) \equiv \Phi_c$. Our estimate is $\Phi_c/2\pi=0.1296(1)$. Based on the values of $n(m)$ determined for integers $m\leq60$, we propose a mathematical conjecture for the form of $\Phi_c(m)$ to be used in the large-$m$ limit. The asymptotic critical flux obtained using this conjecture is $\Phi_c^{{\rm (conj)}}/2\pi=7/54$.</description>

      <title>Higher form symmetries and orbifolds of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized $\theta$-angle.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions with subordinate variables for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a periodic domain with the force decaying in time. Although the force has a certain coherent decay, as time tends to infinity, it can be too complicated for the previous theory of asymptotic expansions to be applicable. To deal with this issue, we systematically develop a new theory of asymptotic expansions containing the so-called subordinate variables which can be defined recursively. We apply it to obtain an asymptotic expansion for any Leray-Hopf weak solutions. The expansion, in fact, is constructed explicitly and the impact of the subordinate variables can be clearly specified. The complexifications of the Gevrey-Sobolev spaces, and of the Stokes and bilinear operators of the Navier-Stokes equations are utilized to facilitate such a construction.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

      <title>A novel class of functionals for perturbative algebraic quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (pAQFT) is based upon formal power series valued in spaces of functionals. This is usually done with microcausal functionals, which are defined using microlocal analysis and motivated by propagation of singularities. In this paper, we prove that the class of microcausal functionals is not closed under the Peierls (Poisson) bracket by showing that a Peierls bracket of regular functionals can fail to be smooth. Consequently, microcausal functionals are not a suitable basis for pAQFT. To remedy these issues, we introduce the class of equicausal functionals. We show that this class contains the local functionals and that it closes under the star-product and Peierls bracket. Furthermore, we prove the time-slice axiom for equicausal functionals, using a chain homotopy. The class of microcausal functionals is not closed under this chain homotopy, which strongly suggests that the class of microcausal functionals does not fulfill the time slice axiom.</description>

      <title>The Causal Axioms of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory: A Diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) puts forward three "causal axioms" that aim to characterize the theory as one that implements relativistic causation: the spectrum condition, microcausality, and primitive causality. In this paper, I aim to show, in a minimally technical way, that none of them fully explains the notion of causation appropriate for AQFT because they only capture some of the desiderata for relativistic causation I state or because it is often unclear how each axiom implements its respective desideratum. After this diagnostic, I will show that a fourth condition, local primitive causality (LPC), fully characterizes relativistic causation in the sense of fulfilling all the relevant desiderata. However, it only encompasses the virtues of the other axioms because it is implied by them, as I will show from a construction by Haag and Schroer (1962). Since the conjunction of the three causal axioms implies LPC and other important results in QFT that LPC does not imply, and since LPC helps clarify some of the shortcomings of the three axioms, I advocate for a holistic interpretation of how the axioms characterize the causal structure of AQFT against the strategy in the literature to rivalize the axioms and privilege one among them.</description>

      <title>Integrable discretization of the vector/matrix nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the associated Yang-Baxter map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:1505.07924v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The action of a B\"acklund-Darboux transformation on a spectral problem associated with a known integrable system can define a new discrete spectral problem. In this paper, we interpret a slightly generalized version of the binary B\"acklund-Darboux (or Zakharov-Shabat dressing) transformation for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) hierarchy as a discrete spectral problem, wherein the two intermediate potentials appearing in the Darboux matrix are considered as a pair of new dependent variables. Then, we associate the discrete spectral problem with a suitable isospectral time-evolution equation, which forms the Lax-pair representation for a space-discrete NLS system. This formulation is valid for the most general case where the two dependent variables take values in (rectangular) matrices. In contrast to the matrix generalization of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice, our discretization has a rational nonlinearity and admits a Hermitian conjugation reduction between the two dependent variables. Thus, a new proper space-discretization of the vector/matrix NLS equation is obtained; by changing the time part of the Lax pair, we also obtain an integrable space-discretization of the vector/matrix modified KdV (mKdV) equation. Because B\"acklund-Darboux transformations are permutable, we can increase the number of discrete independent variables in a multi-dimensionally consistent way. By solving the consistency condition on the two-dimensional lattice, we obtain a Yang-Baxter map of the NLS type, which can be considered as a fully discrete analog of the principal chiral model for projection matrices.</description>

      <title>Space Curves from Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Solutions: A Direct Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.06659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection between vortex filament evolution in the local induction approximation and non-linear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation by Hasimoto [H. Hasimoto, J. Fluid Mechanics 51, (1972) 477] has led to space curves corresponding to NLS solitons in the past. Utilizing this map, we propose a direct construction of parametric curve evolution from any NLS solution. It includes ordered (or nested) integrals of products of local matrices akin to the causal evolution of quantum theory, necessitating the implementation of the Magnus expansion. Such a straightforward mapping may be a simple tool to study the evolution of various systems of physical concern, although the actual computation can be a challenge for most NLS solutions.</description>

Abstract: Poncelet polygons inscribed in a circle and circumscribed about conics from a confocal family naturally arise in the analysis of the numerical range and Blaschke products. We examine the behaviour of such polygons when the inscribed conic varies through a confocal pencil and discover cases when each conic from the confocal family is inscribed in an $n$-polygon, which is inscribed in the circle, with the same $n$. Complete geometric characterization of such cases for $n\in\{4,6\}$ is given and proved that this cannot happen for other values of $n$. We establish a relationship of such families of Poncelet quadrangles and hexagons to solutions of a Painlev\'e VI equation.</description>

      <title>Classification of modular data of integral modular fusion categories up to rank 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01613v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a classification of all integral modular fusion categories' modular data and, more broadly, all integral half-Frobenius fusion rings, up to rank 12. We get that each perfect integral modular fusion category, as well as every perfect integral half-Frobenius fusion ring, up to rank 12, is trivial. Furthermore, we establish that every integral modular fusion category of rank 13 is pointed, up to 2 types in progress. We have also refined the categorifiable non-pointed odd-dimensional modular data at ranks below 25 to three possible items, all of rank 17, FPdim 225, and type [[1,3],[3,8],[5,6]], filling literature potential gaps. For rank 25, we have narrowed down the perfect case to 21 types.
  Our initial key insight is that the Egyptian fractions, which are typically employed to list possible types, can be chosen with squared denominators. We then develop several type criteria as initial filters. Particularly, we establish that the number of distinct basic FPdims in a non-trivial perfect fusion ring must be at least 4. To obtain the fusion rings, we solve the dimension and associativity equations using an updated version of Normaliz designed specifically for this purpose. The S-matrices (if they exist) are obtained by self-transposing the character table, while the T-matrices are derived by solving the Anderson-Moore-Vafa equations. Finally, we verify the extended axioms of modular data.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Analysis Approach to Tensor Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two different arguments using stochastic analysis to construct super-renormalizable tensor field theories, namely the $\mathrm{T}^4_3$ and $\mathrm{T}^4_4$ models. The first approach is the construction of a Langevin dynamic combined with a PDE energy estimate while the second is an application of the variational approach of Barashkov and Gubinelli. By leveraging the melonic structure of divergences, regularising properties of non-local products, and controlling certain random operators, we demonstrate that for tensor field theories these arguments can be significantly simplified in comparison to what is required for $\Phi^4_d$ models.</description>

      <title>Geometric Positivity of the Fusion Products of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebra Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unitary and strongly rational vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ is called strongly unitary if all irreducible $V$-modules are unitarizable. A strongly unitary VOA $V$ is called completely unitary if for each unitary $V$-modules $W_1$, $W_2$ the canonical nondegenerate Hermitian form on the fusion product $W_1\boxtimes W_2$ is positive. It is known that if $V$ is completely unitary, then the modular category of unitary $V$-modules is unitary [Gui19b], and all simple VOA extensions of V are automatically unitary and moreover completely unitary [Gui22, CGGH23].
  In this paper, we give a geometric characterization of the positivity of the Hermitian product on $W_1$ and $W_2$, which helps us prove that the positivity is always true when the fusion product $W_1\boxtimes W_2$ is an irreducible and unitarizable $V$-module. We give several applications: (1) We show that if $V$ is a unitary (strongly rational) holomorphic VOA with a finite cyclic unitary automorphism group $G$, and if $V^G$ is strongly unitary, then $V^G$ is completely unitary. This result applies to the cyclic permutation orbifolds of unitary holomophic VOAs. (2) We show that if $V$ is unitary and strongly rational, and if $U$ is a simple current extension which is unitarizable as a $V$-module, then $U$ is a unitary VOA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a UV divergence of the propagator integral implies the divergences of the UV/IR mixing in the two-point function at one-loop for a $\phi^4$-theory on a generic Lie algebra-type noncommutative space-time. The UV/IR mixing is defined as a UV divergence of the planar contribution and an IR singularity of the non-planar contribution, the latter being due to the former UV divergence, and the UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution. Some properties of this general treatment are discussed. The UV finiteness of the non-planar contribution and the renormalizability of the theory are not treated but commented. Applications are performed for the Moyal space, having a UV/IR mixing, and the $\kappa$-Minkowski space for which the two-point function at one-loop is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

      <title>The noisy Landau-Streater or the Werner-Holevo channel in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two important classes of quantum channels, namly the Werner-Holevo and the Landau-Streater channels are known to be related only in three dimensions, i.e. when acting on qutrits. In this work, the definition of the Landau-Streater channel is extended in such a way which retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in all dimensions. This channel is then modified to be representable as a model of noise acting on qudits. We then investigate propeties of the resulting noisy channel and determine the conditions under which it cannot be the result of a Markovian evolution. Furthermore, we investigate its different capacities for transmitting classical and quantum information with or without entanglement. In particular, while the pure (or high noise) Landau-Streater or the Werner-Holevo channel is entanglement breaking and hence has zero capacity, by finding a lower bound for the quantum capacity, we show that when the level of noise is lower than a critical value the quantum capacity will be non-zero. Surprizingly this value turns out to be approximately equal to $0.4$ in all dimensions. Finally we show that, in even dimensions, this channel has a decomposition in terms of unitary operations. This is in contrast with the three dimensional case where it has been proved that such a decomposition is possible is impossible, even in terms of other quantum maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and optimal transport of point processes</title>

Abstract: We examine optimal matchings or transport between two stationary point processes and in particular, from a point process to the (integer) lattice or the Lebesgue measure respectively. The main focus of the article is the implication of hyperuniformity (reduced variance fluctuations in point processes) to optimal transport: in dimension $2$, we show that the typical matching cost has finite second moment under a mild logarithmic integrability condition on the reduced pair correlation measure, showing that most planar hyperuniform point processes are $ L^2$-perturbed lattices. Our method does not formally require assumptions on the correlation measure or the variance behaviour and it retrieves known sharp bounds for neutral integrable systems such as Poisson processes, and also applies to hyperfluctuating systems. The proof relies on the estimation of the optimal transport cost between point processes restricted to large windows for a well-chosen cost through their Fourier-Stieljes transforms, related to their structure factor. The existence of an infinite matching is obtained through a compactness argument on the space of random measures.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability of Soliton for the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation in the $L^2$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the orbital stability of the 1-soliton solution for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation under perturbations in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We demonstrate this stability by utilizing the B\"acklund transformation associated with the Lax pair and by applying the first conservation quantity in $L^2(\mathbb{R}).$</description>
