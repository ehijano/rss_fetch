      <title>A New Reliable &amp; Parsimonious Learning Strategy Comprising Two Layers of Gaussian Processes, to Address Inhomogeneous Empirical Correlation Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new strategy for learning the functional relation between a pair of variables, while addressing inhomogeneities in the correlation structure of the available data, by modelling the sought function as a sample function of a non-stationary Gaussian Process (GP), that nests within itself multiple other GPs, each of which we prove can be stationary, thereby establishing sufficiency of two GP layers. In fact, a non-stationary kernel is envisaged, with each hyperparameter set as dependent on the sample function drawn from the outer non-stationary GP, such that a new sample function is drawn at every pair of input values at which the kernel is computed. However, such a model cannot be implemented, and we substitute this by recalling that the average effect of drawing different sample functions from a given GP is equivalent to that of drawing a sample function from each of a set of GPs that are rendered different, as updated during the equilibrium stage of the undertaken inference (via MCMC). The kernel is fully non-parametric, and it suffices to learn one hyperparameter per layer of GP, for each dimension of the input variable. We illustrate this new learning strategy on a real dataset.</description>

      <title>Understanding Optimal Feature Transfer via a Fine-Grained Bias-Variance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the transfer learning paradigm models learn useful representations (or features) during a data-rich pretraining stage, and then use the pretrained representation to improve model performance on data-scarce downstream tasks. In this work, we explore transfer learning with the goal of optimizing downstream performance. We introduce a simple linear model that takes as input an arbitrary pretrained feature transform. We derive exact asymptotics of the downstream risk and its fine-grained bias-variance decomposition. Our finding suggests that using the ground-truth featurization can result in "double-divergence" of the asymptotic risk, indicating that it is not necessarily optimal for downstream performance. We then identify the optimal pretrained representation by minimizing the asymptotic downstream risk averaged over an ensemble of downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals the relative importance of learning the task-relevant features and structures in the data covariates and characterizes how each contributes to controlling the downstream risk from a bias-variance perspective. Moreover, we uncover a phase transition phenomenon where the optimal pretrained representation transitions from hard to soft selection of relevant features and discuss its connection to principal component regression.</description>

      <title>Neural Methods for Amortised Parameter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based methods for making statistical inference have evolved dramatically over the past 50 years, keeping pace with technological advancements. The field is undergoing a new revolution as it embraces the representational capacity of neural networks, optimisation libraries, and graphics processing units for learning complex mappings between data and inferential targets. The resulting tools are amortised, in the sense that they allow inference to be made quickly through fast feedforward operations. In this article we review recent progress made in the context of point estimation, approximate Bayesian inference, the automatic construction of summary statistics, and likelihood approximation. The review also covers available software, and includes a simple illustration to showcase the wide array of tools available for amortised inference and the benefits they offer over state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The article concludes with an overview of relevant topics and an outlook on future research directions.</description>

      <title>Risk Bounds for Mixture Density Estimation on Compact Domains via the $h$-Lifted Kullback--Leibler Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating probability density functions based on sample data, using a finite mixture of densities from some component class. To this end, we introduce the $h$-lifted Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as a generalization of the standard KL divergence and a criterion for conducting risk minimization. Under a compact support assumption, we prove an $\mc{O}(1/{\sqrt{n}})$ bound on the expected estimation error when using the $h$-lifted KL divergence, which extends the results of Rakhlin et al. (2005, ESAIM: Probability and Statistics, Vol. 9) and Li and Barron (1999, Advances in Neural Information ProcessingSystems, Vol. 12) to permit the risk bounding of density functions that are not strictly positive. We develop a procedure for the computation of the corresponding maximum $h$-lifted likelihood estimators ($h$-MLLEs) using the Majorization-Maximization framework and provide experimental results in support of our theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Approach to the Parameter Estimation Problem for One-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel algorithm for estimating parameters in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The algorithm takes advantage of the Hankel structure inherent in the Fourier data obtained from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples of the mixture. For GMMs with a unified variance, a singular value ratio functional using the Fourier data is introduced and used to resolve the variance and component number simultaneously. The consistency of the estimator is derived. Compared to classic algorithms such as the method of moments and the maximum likelihood method, the proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the number of Gaussian components or good initial guesses. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance in estimation accuracy and computational cost. Second, we reveal that there exists a fundamental limit to the problem of estimating the number of Gaussian components or model order in the mixture model if the number of i.i.d samples is finite. For the case of a single variance, we show that the model order can be successfully estimated only if the minimum separation distance between the component means exceeds a certain threshold value and can fail if below. We derive a lower bound for this threshold value, referred to as the computational resolution limit, in terms of the number of i.i.d samples, the variance, and the number of Gaussian components. Numerical experiments confirm this phase transition phenomenon in estimating the model order. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better scores in likelihood, AIC, and BIC when compared to the EM algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Feature Importance Methods for Scientific Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used due to their high predictive power, their use in understanding the data-generating process (DGP) is limited. Understanding the DGP requires insights into feature-target associations, which many ML models cannot directly provide, due to their opaque internal mechanisms. Feature importance (FI) methods provide useful insights into the DGP under certain conditions. Since the results of different FI methods have different interpretations, selecting the correct FI method for a concrete use case is crucial and still requires expert knowledge. This paper serves as a comprehensive guide to help understand the different interpretations of FI methods. Through an extensive review of FI methods and providing new proofs regarding their interpretation, we facilitate a thorough understanding of these methods and formulate concrete recommendations for scientific inference. We conclude by discussing options for FI uncertainty estimation and point to directions for future research aiming at full statistical inference from black-box ML models.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic-Numeric SMC Sampling for Bayesian Nonlinear System Identification in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In engineering, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamic systems from data contaminated by noise is both essential and complex. Established Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, used for the Bayesian identification of these systems, facilitate the quantification of uncertainty in the parameter identification process. A significant challenge in this context is the numerical integration of continuous-time ordinary differential equations (ODEs), crucial for aligning theoretical models with discretely sampled data. This integration introduces additional numerical uncertainty, a factor that is often over looked. To address this issue, the field of probabilistic numerics combines numerical methods, such as numerical integration, with probabilistic modeling to offer a more comprehensive analysis of total uncertainty. By retaining the accuracy of classical deterministic methods, these probabilistic approaches offer a deeper understanding of the uncertainty inherent in the inference process. This paper demonstrates the application of a probabilistic numerical method for solving ODEs in the joint parameter-state identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. The presented approach efficiently identifies latent states and system parameters from noisy measurements. Simultaneously incorporating probabilistic solutions to the ODE in the identification challenge. The methodology's primary advantage lies in its capability to produce posterior distributions over system parameters, thereby representing the inherent uncertainties in both the data and the identification process.</description>

      <title>Neural Flow Diffusion Models: Learnable Forward Process for Improved Diffusion Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the fixed linear Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories. This exploration underscores NFDM's versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Reconstruction and Forecasting of Atmospheric Chemistry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on three months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts known major features of atmospheric chemistry, such as summertime surface pollution and biomass burning activities. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking changepoint detection algorithms on cardiac time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pattern of state changes in a biomedical time series can be related to health or disease. This work presents a principled approach for selecting a changepoint detection algorithm for a specific task, such as disease classification. Eight key algorithms were compared, and the performance of each algorithm was evaluated as a function of temporal tolerance, noise, and abnormal conduction (ectopy) on realistic artificial cardiovascular time series data. All algorithms were applied to real data (cardiac time series of 22 patients with REM-behavior disorder (RBD) and 15 healthy controls) using the parameters selected on artificial data. Finally, features were derived from the detected changepoints to classify RBD patients from healthy controls using a K-Nearest Neighbors approach. On artificial data, Modified Bayesian Changepoint Detection algorithm provided superior positive predictive value for state change identification while Recursive Mean Difference Maximization (RMDM) achieved the highest true positive rate. For the classification task, features derived from the RMDM algorithm provided the highest leave one out cross validated accuracy of 0.89 and true positive rate of 0.87. Automatically detected changepoints provide useful information about subject's physiological state which cannot be directly observed. However, the choice of change point detection algorithm depends on the nature of the underlying data and the downstream application, such as a classification task. This work represents the first time change point detection algorithms have been compared in a meaningful way and utilized in a classification task, which demonstrates the effect of changepoint algorithm choice on application performance.</description>

Abstract: This thesis studies the graph alignment problem, the noisy version of the graph isomorphism problem, which aims to find a matching between the nodes of two graphs which preserves most of the edges. Focusing on the planted version where the graphs are random, we are interested in understanding the fundamental information-theoretical limits for this problem, as well as designing and analyzing algorithms that are able to recover the underlying alignment in the data. For these algorithms, we give some high probability guarantees on the regime in which they succeed or fail.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Language Models as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theorem proving is an important challenge for large language models (LLMs), as formal proofs can be checked rigorously by proof assistants such as Lean, leaving no room for hallucination. Existing LLM-based provers try to prove theorems in a fully autonomous mode without human intervention. In this mode, they struggle with novel and challenging theorems, for which human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a framework for running LLM inference in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Using Lean Copilot, we build tools for suggesting proof steps (tactic suggestion), completing intermediate proof goals (proof search), and selecting relevant premises (premise selection) using LLMs. Users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in assisting humans and automating theorem proving process compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean. We open source all codes under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based solutions are rapidly changing the landscape of many fields, including structural engineering. Despite their promising performance, these approaches are usually only demonstrated as proof-of-concept in structural engineering, and are rarely deployed for real-world applications. This paper aims to illustrate the challenges of developing ML models suitable for deployment through two illustrative examples. Among various pitfalls, the presented discussion focuses on model overfitting and underspecification, training data representativeness, variable omission bias, and cross-validation. The results highlight the importance of implementing rigorous model validation techniques through adaptive sampling, careful physics-informed feature selection, and considerations of both model complexity and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Integer Programming for Learning Directed Acyclic Graphs from Non-identifiable Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning directed acyclic graphs from continuous observational data, generated according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model. State-of-the-art structure learning methods for this setting have at least one of the following shortcomings: i) they cannot provide optimality guarantees and can suffer from learning sub-optimal models; ii) they rely on the stringent assumption that the noise is homoscedastic, and hence the underlying model is fully identifiable. We overcome these shortcomings and develop a computationally efficient mixed-integer programming framework for learning medium-sized problems that accounts for arbitrary heteroscedastic noise. We present an early stopping criterion under which we can terminate the branch-and-bound procedure to achieve an asymptotically optimal solution and establish the consistency of this approximate solution. In addition, we show via numerical experiments that our method outperforms three state-of-the-art algorithms and is robust to noise heteroscedasticity, whereas the performance of the competing methods deteriorates under strong violations of the identifiability assumption. The software implementation of our method is available as the Python package \emph{micodag}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalization ability of kernel interpolation in large dimensions (i.e., $n \asymp d^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma&gt;0$) might be one of the most interesting problems in the recent renaissance of kernel regression, since it may help us understand the 'benign overfitting phenomenon' reported in the neural networks literature. Focusing on the inner product kernel on the sphere, we fully characterized the exact order of both the variance and bias of large-dimensional kernel interpolation under various source conditions $s\geq 0$. Consequently, we obtained the $(s,\gamma)$-phase diagram of large-dimensional kernel interpolation, i.e., we determined the regions in $(s,\gamma)$-plane where the kernel interpolation is minimax optimal, sub-optimal and inconsistent.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient Learning of Infinite-horizon Average-reward MDPs with General Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision processes (AMDPs) in the context of general function approximation. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithmic framework named Local-fitted Optimization with OPtimism (LOOP), which incorporates both model-based and value-based incarnations. In particular, LOOP features a novel construction of confidence sets and a low-switching policy updating scheme, which are tailored to the average-reward and function approximation setting. Moreover, for AMDPs, we propose a novel complexity measure -- average-reward generalized eluder coefficient (AGEC) -- which captures the challenge of exploration in AMDPs with general function approximation. Such a complexity measure encompasses almost all previously known tractable AMDP models, such as linear AMDPs and linear mixture AMDPs, and also includes newly identified cases such as kernel AMDPs and AMDPs with Bellman eluder dimensions. Using AGEC, we prove that LOOP achieves a sublinear $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(d, \mathrm{sp}(V^*)) \sqrt{T\beta} )$ regret, where $d$ and $\beta$ correspond to AGEC and log-covering number of the hypothesis class respectively, $\mathrm{sp}(V^*)$ is the span of the optimal state bias function, $T$ denotes the number of steps, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. When specialized to concrete AMDP models, our regret bounds are comparable to those established by the existing algorithms designed specifically for these special cases. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive theoretical framework capable of handling nearly all AMDPs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Calibration by Gaining Aware of Prediction Correctness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model calibration aims to align confidence with prediction correctness. The Cross-Entropy CE) loss is widely used for calibrator training, which enforces the model to increase confidence on the ground truth class. However, we find the CE loss has intrinsic limitations. For example, for a narrow misclassification, a calibrator trained by the CE loss often produces high confidence on the wrongly predicted class (e.g., a test sample is wrongly classified and its softmax score on the ground truth class is around 0.4), which is undesirable. In this paper, we propose a new post-hoc calibration objective derived from the aim of calibration. Intuitively, the proposed objective function asks that the calibrator decrease model confidence on wrongly predicted samples and increase confidence on correctly predicted samples. Because a sample itself has insufficient ability to indicate correctness, we use its transformed versions (e.g., rotated, greyscaled and color-jittered) during calibrator training. Trained on an in-distribution validation set and tested with isolated, individual test samples, our method achieves competitive calibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets compared with the state of the art. Further, our analysis points out the difference between our method and commonly used objectives such as CE loss and mean square error loss, where the latters sometimes deviates from the calibration aim.</description>

      <title>Learning multi-modal generative models with permutation-invariant encoders and tighter variational bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Devising deep latent variable models for multi-modal data has been a long-standing theme in machine learning research. Multi-modal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been a popular generative model class that learns latent representations that jointly explain multiple modalities. Various objective functions for such models have been suggested, often motivated as lower bounds on the multi-modal data log-likelihood or from information-theoretic considerations. To encode latent variables from different modality subsets, Product-of-Experts (PoE) or Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation schemes have been routinely used and shown to yield different trade-offs, for instance, regarding their generative quality or consistency across multiple modalities. In this work, we consider a variational bound that can tightly approximate the data log-likelihood. We develop more flexible aggregation schemes that generalize PoE or MoE approaches by combining encoded features from different modalities based on permutation-invariant neural networks. Our numerical experiments illustrate trade-offs for multi-modal variational bounds and various aggregation schemes. We show that tighter variational bounds and more flexible aggregation models can become beneficial when one wants to approximate the true joint distribution over observed modalities and latent variables in identifiable models.</description>

      <title>Differential Equation Scaling Limits of Shaped and Unshaped Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses of neural networks with shaped activations (i.e. the activation function is scaled as the network size grows) have led to scaling limits described by differential equations. However, these results do not a priori tell us anything about "ordinary" unshaped networks, where the activation is unchanged as the network size grows. In this article, we find similar differential equation based asymptotic characterization for two types of unshaped networks.
  Firstly, we show that the following two architectures converge to the same infinite-depth-and-width limit at initialization: (i) a fully connected ResNet with a $d^{-1/2}$ factor on the residual branch, where $d$ is the network depth. (ii) a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with depth $d \ll$ width $n$ and shaped ReLU activation at rate $d^{-1/2}$.
  Secondly, for an unshaped MLP at initialization, we derive the first order asymptotic correction to the layerwise correlation. In particular, if $\rho_\ell$ is the correlation at layer $\ell$, then $q_t = \ell^2 (1 - \rho_\ell)$ with $t = \frac{\ell}{n}$ converges to an SDE with a singularity at $t=0$.
  These results together provide a connection between shaped and unshaped network architectures, and opens up the possibility of studying the effect of normalization methods and how it connects with shaping activation functions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Smoothed Gradient Descent Ascent for Federated Minimax Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, federated minimax optimization has attracted growing interest due to its extensive applications in various machine learning tasks. While Smoothed Alternative Gradient Descent Ascent (Smoothed-AGDA) has proved its success in centralized nonconvex minimax optimization, how and whether smoothing technique could be helpful in federated setting remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm termed Federated Stochastic Smoothed Gradient Descent Ascent (FESS-GDA), which utilizes the smoothing technique for federated minimax optimization. We prove that FESS-GDA can be uniformly used to solve several classes of federated minimax problems and prove new or better analytical convergence results for these settings. We showcase the practical efficiency of FESS-GDA in practical federated learning tasks of training generative adversarial networks (GANs) and fair classification.</description>

      <title>Negative impact of heavy-tailed uncertainty and error distributions on the reliability of calibration statistics for machine learning regression tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Average calibration of the prediction uncertainties of machine learning regression tasks can be tested in two ways: one is to estimate the calibration error (CE) as the difference between the mean absolute error (MSE) and the mean variance (MV) or mean squared uncertainty; the alternative is to compare the mean squared z-scores (ZMS) or scaled errors to 1. The problem is that both approaches might lead to different conclusions, as illustrated in this study for an ensemble of datasets from the recent machine learning uncertainty quantification (ML-UQ) literature. It is shown that the estimation of MV, MSE and their confidence intervals can become unreliable for heavy-tailed uncertainty and error distributions, which seems to be a common issue for ML-UQ datasets. By contrast, the ZMS statistic is less sensitive and offers the most reliable approach in this context. Unfortunately, the same problem affects also conditional calibrations statistics, such as the popular ENCE, and very likely post-hoc calibration methods based on similar statistics. As not much can be done to relieve this issue, except for a change of paradigm to intervals- or distribution-based UQ metrics, robust tailedness metrics are proposed to detect the potentially problematic datasets.</description>

Abstract: Recent research in inverse cognition with cognitive radar has led to the development of inverse stochastic filters that are employed by the target to infer the information the cognitive radar may have learned. Prior works addressed this inverse cognition problem by proposing inverse Kalman filter (I-KF) and inverse extended KF (I-EKF), respectively, for linear and non-linear Gaussian state-space models. However, in practice, many counter-adversarial settings involve highly non-linear system models, wherein EKF's linearization often fails. In this paper, we consider the efficient numerical integration techniques to address such non-linearities and, to this end, develop inverse cubature KF (I-CKF), inverse quadrature KF (I-QKF), and inverse cubature-quadrature KF (I-CQKF). For the unknown system model case, we develop reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based CKF. We derive the stochastic stability conditions for the proposed filters in the exponential-mean-squared-boundedness sense and prove the filters' consistency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the estimation accuracy of our I-CKF, I-QKF, and I-CQKF with the recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Noise Stability Optimization for Flat Minima with Tight Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider minimizing a perturbed function $F(W) = \mathbb{E}_{U}[f(W + U)]$, given a function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and a random sample $U$ from a distribution $\mathcal{P}$ with mean zero. When $\mathcal{P}$ is the isotropic Gaussian, $F(W)$ is roughly equal to $f(W)$ plus a penalty on the trace of $\nabla^2 f(W)$, scaled by the variance of $\mathcal{P}$. This penalty on the Hessian has the benefit of improving generalization, through PAC-Bayes analysis. It is useful in low-sample regimes, for instance, when a (large) pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a small data set. One way to minimize $F$ is by adding $U$ to $W$, and then run SGD. We observe, empirically, that this noise injection does not provide significant gains over SGD, in our experiments of conducting fine-tuning on three image classification data sets. We design a simple, practical algorithm that adds noise along both $U$ and $-U$, with the option of adding several perturbations and taking their average. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm, showing tight rates on the norm of the output's gradient.
  We provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of our algorithm, by first showing that in an over-parameterized matrix sensing problem, it can find solutions with lower test loss than naive noise injection. Then, we compare our algorithm with four sharpness-reducing training methods (such as the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (Foret et al., 2021)). We find that our algorithm can outperform them by up to 1.8% test accuracy, for fine-tuning ResNet on six image classification data sets. It leads to a 17.7% (and 12.8%) reduction in the trace (and largest eigenvalue) of the Hessian matrix of the loss surface. This form of regularization on the Hessian is compatible with $\ell_2$ weight decay (and data augmentation), in the sense that combining both can lead to improved empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Lion Secretly Solves Constrained Optimization: As Lyapunov Predicts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05898v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.
  This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) + \kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related algorithms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Decentralized ProxSkip: Achieving Linear Speedup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ProxSkip algorithm for decentralized and federated learning is gaining increasing attention due to its proven benefits in accelerating communication complexity while maintaining robustness against data heterogeneity. However, existing analyses of ProxSkip are limited to the strongly convex setting and do not achieve linear speedup, where convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of nodes. So far, questions remain open about how ProxSkip behaves in the non-convex setting and whether linear speedup is achievable.
  In this paper, we revisit decentralized ProxSkip and address both questions. We demonstrate that the leading communication complexity of ProxSkip is $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2}\right)$ for non-convex and convex settings, and $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon}\right)$ for the strongly convex setting, where $n$ represents the number of nodes, $p$ denotes the probability of communication, $\sigma^2$ signifies the level of stochastic noise, and $\epsilon$ denotes the desired accuracy level. This result illustrates that ProxSkip achieves linear speedup and can asymptotically reduce communication overhead proportional to the probability of communication. Additionally, for the strongly convex setting, we further prove that ProxSkip can achieve linear speedup with network-independent stepsizes.</description>

      <title>High-probability Convergence Bounds for Nonlinear Stochastic Gradient Descent Under Heavy-tailed Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18784v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study high-probability convergence guarantees of learning on streaming data in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. In the proposed scenario, the model is updated in an online fashion, as new information is observed, without storing any additional data. To combat the heavy-tailed noise, we consider a general framework of nonlinear stochastic gradient descent (SGD), providing several strong results. First, for non-convex costs and component-wise nonlinearities, we establish a convergence rate arbitrarily close to $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\frac{1}{4}}\right)$, whose exponent is independent of noise and problem parameters. Second, for strongly convex costs and a broader class of nonlinearities, we establish convergence of the last iterate to the optimum, with a rate $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-\zeta} \right)$, where $\zeta \in (0,1)$ depends on problem parameters, noise and nonlinearity. As we show analytically and numerically, $\zeta$ can be used to inform the preferred choice of nonlinearity for given problem settings. Compared to state-of-the-art, who only consider clipping, require bounded noise moments of order $\eta \in (1,2]$, and establish convergence rates whose exponents go to zero as $\eta \rightarrow 1$, we provide high-probability guarantees for a much broader class of nonlinearities and symmetric density noise, with convergence rates whose exponents are bounded away from zero, even when the noise has finite first moment only. Moreover, in the case of strongly convex functions, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that clipping is not always the optimal nonlinearity, further underlining the value of our general framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning for Bayesian optimisation has generally assumed a strong similarity between optimisation tasks, with at least a subset having similar optimal inputs. This assumption can reduce computational costs, but it is violated in a wide range of optimisation problems where transfer learning may nonetheless be useful. We replace this assumption with a weaker one only requiring the shape of the optimisation landscape to be similar, and analyse the recent method Prior Learning for Bayesian Optimisation - PLeBO - in this setting. By learning priors for the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process surrogate model we can better approximate the underlying function, especially for few function evaluations. We validate the learned priors and compare to a breadth of transfer learning approaches, using synthetic data and a recent air pollution optimisation problem as benchmarks. We show that PLeBO and prior transfer find good inputs in fewer evaluations.</description>

      <title>A unified Fourier slice method to derive ridgelet transform for a variety of depth-2 neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate neural network parameters, it is easier to study the distribution of parameters than to study the parameters in each neuron. The ridgelet transform is a pseudo-inverse operator that maps a given function $f$ to the parameter distribution $\gamma$ so that a network $\mathtt{NN}[\gamma]$ reproduces $f$, i.e. $\mathtt{NN}[\gamma]=f$. For depth-2 fully-connected networks on a Euclidean space, the ridgelet transform has been discovered up to the closed-form expression, thus we could describe how the parameters are distributed. However, for a variety of modern neural network architectures, the closed-form expression has not been known. In this paper, we explain a systematic method using Fourier expressions to derive ridgelet transforms for a variety of modern networks such as networks on finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p$, group convolutional networks on abstract Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, fully-connected networks on noncompact symmetric spaces $G/K$, and pooling layers, or the $d$-plane ridgelet transform.</description>

Abstract: Deep representations have shown promising performance when transferred to downstream tasks in a black-box manner. Yet, their inherent lack of interpretability remains a significant challenge, as these features are often opaque to human understanding. In this paper, we propose Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its enforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's capability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not only aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's interpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled representation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically, we establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of NCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL significantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as downstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily extended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/non_neg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the suitability of Russet potato clones for advancement in breeding trials. Leveraging data from manually collected trials in the state of Oregon, we investigate the potential of a wide variety of state-of-the-art binary classification models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset that includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and imputation to address missing values. We focus on several key metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for model evaluation. The top-performing models, namely the multi-layer perceptron classifier (MLPC), histogram-based gradient boosting classifier (HGBC), and a support vector machine classifier (SVC), demonstrate consistent and significant results. Variable selection further enhances model performance and identifies influential features in predicting trial outcomes. The findings emphasize the potential of machine learning in streamlining the selection process for potato varieties, offering benefits such as increased efficiency, substantial cost savings, and judicious resource utilization. Our study contributes insights into precision agriculture and showcases the relevance of advanced technologies for informed decision-making in breeding programs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty with Proper Scoring Rules</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty representation and quantification are paramount in machine learning and constitute an important prerequisite for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose novel measures for the quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, which are loss functions with the meaningful property that they incentivize the learner to predict ground-truth (conditional) probabilities. We assume two common representations of (epistemic) uncertainty, namely, in terms of a credal set, i.e. a set of probability distributions, or a second-order distribution, i.e., a distribution over probability distributions. Our framework establishes a natural bridge between these representations. We provide a formal justification of our approach and introduce new measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty as concrete instantiations.</description>

      <title>A Quadrature Approach for General-Purpose Batch Bayesian Optimization via Probabilistic Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallelisation in Bayesian optimisation is a common strategy but faces several challenges: the need for flexibility in acquisition functions and kernel choices, flexibility dealing with discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, model misspecification, and lastly fast massive parallelisation. To address these challenges, we introduce a versatile and modular framework for batch Bayesian optimisation via probabilistic lifting with kernel quadrature, called SOBER, which we present as a Python library based on GPyTorch/BoTorch. Our framework offers the following unique benefits: (1) Versatility in downstream tasks under a unified approach. (2) A gradient-free sampler, which does not require the gradient of acquisition functions, offering domain-agnostic sampling (e.g., discrete and mixed variables, non-Euclidean space). (3) Flexibility in domain prior distribution. (4) Adaptive batch size (autonomous determination of the optimal batch size). (5) Robustness against a misspecified reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (6) Natural stopping criterion.</description>
