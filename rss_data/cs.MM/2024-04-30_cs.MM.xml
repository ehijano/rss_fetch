      <title>Dual Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Strategy for Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss functions and sample mining strategies are essential components in deep metric learning algorithms. However, the existing loss function or mining strategy often necessitate the incorporation of additional hyperparameters, notably the threshold, which defines whether the sample pair is informative. The threshold provides a stable numerical standard for determining whether to retain the pairs. It is a vital parameter to reduce the redundant sample pairs participating in training. Nonetheless, finding the optimal threshold can be a time-consuming endeavor, often requiring extensive grid searches. Because the threshold cannot be dynamically adjusted in the training stage, we should conduct plenty of repeated experiments to determine the threshold. Therefore, we introduce a novel approach for adjusting the thresholds associated with both the loss function and the sample mining strategy. We design a static Asymmetric Sample Mining Strategy (ASMS) and its dynamic version Adaptive Tolerance ASMS (AT-ASMS), tailored for sample mining methods. ASMS utilizes differentiated thresholds to address the problems (too few positive pairs and too many redundant negative pairs) caused by only applying a single threshold to filter samples. AT-ASMS can adaptively regulate the ratio of positive and negative pairs during training according to the ratio of the currently mined positive and negative pairs. This meta-learning-based threshold generation algorithm utilizes a single-step gradient descent to obtain new thresholds. We combine these two threshold adjustment algorithms to form the Dual Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Strategy (DDTAS). Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves competitive performance on CUB200, Cars196, and SOP datasets.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Multisensory Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building multisensory AI systems that learn from multiple sensory inputs such as text, speech, video, real-world sensors, wearable devices, and medical data holds great promise for impact in many scientific areas with practical benefits, such as in supporting human health and well-being, enabling multimedia content processing, and enhancing real-world autonomous agents. By synthesizing a range of theoretical frameworks and application domains, this thesis aims to advance the machine learning foundations of multisensory AI. In the first part, we present a theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets, design principled approaches to learn these interactions, and analyze whether their model has succeeded in learning. In the second part, we study the design of practical multimodal foundation models that generalize over many modalities and tasks, which presents a step toward grounding large language models to real-world sensory modalities. We introduce MultiBench, a unified large-scale benchmark across a wide range of modalities, tasks, and research areas, followed by the cross-modal attention and multimodal transformer architectures that now underpin many of today's multimodal foundation models. Scaling these architectures on MultiBench enables the creation of general-purpose multisensory AI systems, and we discuss our collaborative efforts in applying these models for real-world impact in affective computing, mental health, cancer prognosis, and robotics. Finally, we conclude this thesis by discussing how future work can leverage these ideas toward more general, interactive, and safe multisensory AI.</description>

      <title>A Light-weight Transformer-based Self-supervised Matching Network for Heterogeneous Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching visible and near-infrared (NIR) images remains a significant challenge in remote sensing image fusion. The nonlinear radiometric differences between heterogeneous remote sensing images make the image matching task even more difficult. Deep learning has gained substantial attention in computer vision tasks in recent years. However, many methods rely on supervised learning and necessitate large amounts of annotated data. Nevertheless, annotated data is frequently limited in the field of remote sensing image matching. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel keypoint descriptor approach that obtains robust feature descriptors via a self-supervised matching network. A light-weight transformer network, termed as LTFormer, is designed to generate deep-level feature descriptors. Furthermore, we implement an innovative triplet loss function, LT Loss, to enhance the matching performance further. Our approach outperforms conventional hand-crafted local feature descriptors and proves equally competitive compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, even amidst the shortage of annotated data.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Video Face Restoration: A New Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) on images has significantly progressed over the last several years, while real-world video face restoration (VFR), which is more challenging for more complex face motions such as moving gaze directions and facial orientations involved, remains unsolved. Typical BFR methods are evaluated on privately synthesized datasets or self-collected real-world low-quality face images, which are limited in their coverage of real-world video frames. In this work, we introduced new real-world datasets named FOS with a taxonomy of "Full, Occluded, and Side" faces from mainly video frames to study the applicability of current methods on videos. Compared with existing test datasets, FOS datasets cover more diverse degradations and involve face samples from more complex scenarios, which helps to revisit current face restoration approaches more comprehensively. Given the established datasets, we benchmarked both the state-of-the-art BFR methods and the video super resolution (VSR) methods to comprehensively study current approaches, identifying their potential and limitations in VFR tasks. In addition, we studied the effectiveness of the commonly used image quality assessment (IQA) metrics and face IQA (FIQA) metrics by leveraging a subjective user study. With extensive experimental results and detailed analysis provided, we gained insights from the successes and failures of both current BFR and VSR methods. These results also pose challenges to current face restoration approaches, which we hope stimulate future advances in VFR research.</description>

      <title>SemiPL: A Semi-supervised Method for Event Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Event Sound Source Localization has been widely applied in various fields. Recent works typically relying on the contrastive learning framework show impressive performance. However, all work is based on large relatively simple datasets. It's also crucial to understand and analyze human behaviors (actions and interactions of people), voices, and sounds in chaotic events in many applications, e.g., crowd management, and emergency response services. In this paper, we apply the existing model to a more complex dataset, explore the influence of parameters on the model, and propose a semi-supervised improvement method SemiPL. With the increase in data quantity and the influence of label quality, self-supervised learning will be an unstoppable trend. The experiment shows that the parameter adjustment will positively affect the existing model. In particular, SSPL achieved an improvement of 12.2% cIoU and 0.56% AUC in Chaotic World compared to the results provided. The code is available at: https://github.com/ly245422/SSPL</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Verification: Unveiling Disinformation with Structured Representations for Zero-Shot Real-Time Evidence-guided Fact-Checking of Multi-modal Social media posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social Media posts, where real images are unscrupulously reused along with provocative text to promote a particular idea, have been one of the major sources of disinformation. By design, these claims are without editorial oversight and accessible to a vast population who otherwise may not have access to multiple information sources. This implies the need to fact-check these posts and clearly explain which parts of the posts are fake. In the supervised learning setup, this is often reduced to a binary classification problem, neglecting all intermediate stages. Further, these claims often involve recent events on which systems trained on historical data are prone to fail. In this work, we propose a zero-shot approach by retrieving real-time web-scraped evidence from multiple news websites and matching them with the claim text and image using pretrained language vision systems. We propose a graph structured representation, which a) allows us to gather evidence automatically and b) helps generate interpretable results by explicitly pointing out which parts of the claim can not be verified. Our zero-shot method, with improved interpretability, generates competitive results against the state-of-the-art methods</description>

      <title>An Effective Image Copy-Move Forgery Detection Using Entropy Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image forensics has become increasingly crucial in our daily lives. Among various types of forgeries, copy-move forgery detection has received considerable attention within the academic community. Keypoint-based algorithms, particularly those based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform, have achieved promising outcomes. However, most of keypoint detection algorithms failed to generate sufficient matches when tampered patches were occurred in smooth areas, leading to insufficient matches. Therefore, this paper introduces entropy images to determine the coordinates and scales of keypoints based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform detector, which make the pre-processing more suitable for solving the above problems. Furthermore, an overlapped entropy level clustering algorithm is developed to mitigate the increased matching complexity caused by the non-ideal distribution of gray values in keypoints. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a good balance between performance and time efficiency.</description>

      <title>ComposerX: Multi-Agent Symbolic Music Composition with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music composition represents the creative side of humanity, and itself is a complex task that requires abilities to understand and generate information with long dependency and harmony constraints. While demonstrating impressive capabilities in STEM subjects, current LLMs easily fail in this task, generating ill-written music even when equipped with modern techniques like In-Context-Learning and Chain-of-Thoughts. To further explore and enhance LLMs' potential in music composition by leveraging their reasoning ability and the large knowledge base in music history and theory, we propose ComposerX, an agent-based symbolic music generation framework. We find that applying a multi-agent approach significantly improves the music composition quality of GPT-4. The results demonstrate that ComposerX is capable of producing coherent polyphonic music compositions with captivating melodies, while adhering to user instructions.</description>
