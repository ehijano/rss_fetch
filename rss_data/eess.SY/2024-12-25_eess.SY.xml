      <title>Coordinated Power Smoothing Control for Wind Storage Integrated System with Physics-informed Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wind Storage Integrated System with Power Smoothing Control (PSC) has emerged as a promising solution to ensure both efficient and reliable wind energy generation. However, existing PSC strategies overlook the intricate interplay and distinct control frequencies between batteries and wind turbines, and lack consideration of wake effect and battery degradation cost. In this paper, a novel coordinated control framework with hierarchical levels is devised to address these challenges effectively, which integrates the wake model and battery degradation model. In addition, after reformulating the problem as a Markov decision process, the multi-agent reinforcement learning method is introduced to overcome the bi-level characteristic of the problem. Moreover, a Physics-informed Neural Network-assisted Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PAMA-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to incorporate the power fluctuation differential equation and expedite the learning process. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated through simulations conducted in four distinct scenarios using WindFarmSimulator (WFSim). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm facilitates approximately an 11% increase in total profit and a 19% decrease in power fluctuation compared to the traditional methods, thereby addressing the dual objectives of economic efficiency and grid-connected energy reliability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric motors are crucial in many applications, but traditional control methods struggle with nonlinearities, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution as a data-driven approach that can learn optimal control strategies without an explicit model. This review paper examines the current state of RL in motor control, exploring various RL algorithms and applications. The review highlights RL's advantages, including model-free control, adaptability to changing conditions, and the ability to optimize for complex objectives. It also addresses challenges in applying RL to motor control, such as sim-to-real transfer, safety and stability concerns, scalability, and computational complexity. By providing a comprehensive overview of the field, this review aims to deepen understanding of RL's potential to revolutionize motor control and drive advancements across industries.</description>

      <title>Integrated Learning and Optimization for Congestion Management and Profit Maximization in Real-Time Electricity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Power Management in Modular Reconfigurable Battery Systems with Energy and Power Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating power electronics with batteries can offer many advantages, including load sharing and balancing with parallel connectivity. However, parallel batteries with differing voltages and power profiles can cause large circulating currents and uncontrolled energy transfers, risking system instability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel modular reconfigurable topology for AC batteries with coupled inductors between adjacent submodules. This approach dynamically manages energy distribution between energy and power modules. Under normal conditions, energy modules operate in series or parallel configurations to deliver stable voltage and current, ensuring efficient power delivery. During heavy loads, such as during electric-vehicle acceleration, power modules seamlessly meet additional power demands beyond the energy modules' capacity. The use of mutual inductors reduces inductance along the load path for faster response times while providing sufficient inductance to regulate circulating currents and enable efficient energy transfer among modules. The system's AC load further complicates control, necessitating a simple yet effective feedforward-feedback control strategy to maintain satisfactory performance.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Critic Augmentation for Hierarchical Multi-Agent EV Charging Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only effectively reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience of handling practical issues, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. However, existing EV charging strategies have yet to fully consider these factors in a way that benefits both office buildings and EV users simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and electric vehicles. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, a new critic augmentation is introduced to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information.</description>

      <title>Future Pathways for EVTOLs: A Design Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of advanced urban air mobility, particularly electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, requires interdisciplinary approaches involving the future urban air mobility ecosystem. Operational cost efficiency, regulatory aspects, sustainability, and environmental compatibility must be incorporated directly into the preliminary design of aircraft and across operational and regulatory strategies. In this work, we present a novel multidisciplinary design optimization framework for the preliminary design of eVTOL aircraft. The framework optimizes conventional design elements of eVTOL aircraft over a generic mission and integrates a comprehensive operational cost model to directly capture economic incentives of the designed system through profit modeling for operators. We compare the optimized eVTOL system with various competing road, rail, and air transportation modes in terms of sustainability, cost, and travel time. We investigate four objective-specific eVTOL optimization designs in a broad scenario space, mapping regulatory, technical, and operational constraints to generate a representation of potential urban air mobility ecosystem conditions. The analysis of an optimized profit-maximizing eVTOL, cost-minimizing eVTOL, sustainability-maximizing eVTOL, and a combined figure of merit maximizing eVTOL design highlights significant trade-offs in the area of profitability, operational flexibility, and sustainability strategies. This underlines the importance of incorporating multiple operationally tangential disciplines into the design process.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Approach for Fast Optimal Control of a Stefan Problem with Application to Cell Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes a new, efficient way of finding control and state trajectories in optimal control problems by transformation into a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The optimal control and state vectors can be obtained via simulation of the resulting DAE system with the selected DAE solver, eliminating the need for an optimization solver. Our simulation-based framework was demonstrated and benchmarked against various optimization-based approaches via four case studies associated with optimization and control of a Stefan problem with application to cell therapy. The simulation-based approach is faster than every optimization-based method by more than an order of magnitude while giving the same level of accuracy in all cases. The proposed technique offers an efficient and reliable framework for optimal control, serving as a promising alternative to the traditional techniques in applications where speed is crucial, e.g., real-time online model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis and Experimental Design of High-Gain DC-DC Boost Converter Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global demand for clean and eco-friendly energy sources has inspired decades of far-reaching research in power generation from renewable energy sources. Solar cells, wind, and tidal sources are limited in output power generation compared to the fast-rising power requirements of most industrial applications. Besides, the efficiency of conventional DC-DC boost converters is significantly low due to the presence of parasitic elements culminating in switching losses. This study presents three high-gain boost converter topologies for optimizing the limited voltage generation by solar Photovoltaic cells. The three converters are realized based on a modification of a classical Cuk converter. Simply put, the first proposed converter is realized by the inclusion of one capacitor and one inductor to the classical topology. Similarly, the addition of 3 capacitors, 2 diodes, and one inductor leads to the practical realization of the second proposed topology. Similarly, the third proposed topology consists of additional 3 diodes and 3 capacitors. Based on this estimation, the first, second, and third proposed high gain modified Cuk converter topologies generate output voltages 10 times, 20 times, and 29 times the input voltage respectively when the switching device is gated at 90% duty ratio. Theoretical/mathematical analysis validates the Lt-spice numerical simulation results of all the proposed converters. Furthermore, experimental prototype results were compared with Lt-spice estimation to determine the accuracy of the converters.</description>

      <title>SCKF-LSTM Based Trajectory Tracking for Electricity-Gas Integrated Energy System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for tracking the dynamic trajectories of integrated natural gas and power systems, leveraging a Kalman filter-based structure. To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimum-Phase Resonant Controller for Active Damping Control: Application to Piezo-Actuated Nanopositioning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopositioning systems frequently encounter limitations in control bandwidth due to their lightly damped resonance behavior. This paper presents a novel Non-Minimum-Phase Resonant Controller (NRC) aimed at active damping control within dual closed-loop architectures, specifically applied to piezo-actuated nanopositioning systems. The control strategy is structured around formulated objectives for shaping sensitivity functions to meet predetermined system performance criteria. Leveraging non-minimum-phase characteristics, the proposed NRC accomplishes complete damping and the bifurcation of double resonant poles at the primary resonance peak through a constant-gain design accompanied by tunable phase variation. The NRC demonstrates robustness against frequency variations of the resonance arising from load changes and is also capable of damping higher-order flexural modes simultaneously. Furthermore, by establishing high gains at low frequencies within the inner closed-loop and integrating it with a conventional PI tracking controller, the NRC achieves substantial dual closed-loop bandwidths that can exceed the first resonance frequency. Moreover, the NRC significantly diminishes the effect of low-frequency reference signals on real feedback errors while effectively rejecting disturbances proximate to the resonance frequency. All contributions are thoroughly formulated and exemplified mathematically, with the controller's performance confirmed through an experimental setup utilizing an industrial nanopositioning system. The experimental results indicate dual closed-loop bandwidths of 895 Hz and 845 Hz, characterized by $\pm$3 dB and $\pm$1 dB bounds, respectively, that surpass the resonance frequency of 739 Hz.</description>

      <title>Betting vs. Trading: Learning a Linear Decision Policy for Selling Wind Power and Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a bidding strategy for a hybrid power plant combining co-located wind turbines and an electrolyzer, constructing a price-quantity bidding curve for the day-ahead electricity market while optimally scheduling hydrogen production. Without risk management, single imbalance pricing leads to an all-or-nothing trading strategy, which we term 'betting'. To address this, we propose a data-driven, pragmatic approach that leverages contextual information to train linear decision policies for both power bidding and hydrogen scheduling. By introducing explicit risk constraints to limit imbalances, we move from the all-or-nothing approach to a 'trading" strategy', where the plant diversifies its power trading decisions. We evaluate the model under three scenarios: when the plant is either conditionally allowed, always allowed, or not allowed to buy power from the grid, which impacts the green certification of the hydrogen produced. Comparing our data-driven strategy with an oracle model that has perfect foresight, we show that the risk-constrained, data-driven approach delivers satisfactory performance.</description>

      <title>Koopman operator based identification of nonlinear networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a method to identify continuous-time nonlinear networked dynamics via the Koopman operator framework. The proposed technique consists of two steps: the first step identifies the neighbors of each node, and the second step identifies the local dynamics at each node from a predefined set of dictionary functions. The technique can be used to either identify the Boolean network of interactions (first step) or to solve the complete network identification problem that amounts to estimating the local node dynamics and the nature of the node interactions (first and second steps). Under a sparsity assumption, the data required to identify the complete network dynamics is significantly less than the total number of dictionary functions describing the dynamics. This makes the proposed approach attractive for identifying large dimensional networks with sparse interconnections. The accuracy and performance of the proposed identification technique are demonstrated with several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process control and optimization have been widely used to solve decision-making problems in chemical engineering applications. However, identifying and tuning the best solution algorithm is challenging and time-consuming. Machine learning tools can be used to automate these steps by learning the behavior of a numerical solver from data. In this paper, we discuss recent advances in (i) the representation of decision-making problems for machine learning tasks, (ii) algorithm selection, and (iii) algorithm configuration for monolithic and decomposition-based algorithms. Finally, we discuss open problems related to the application of machine learning for accelerating process optimization and control.</description>

      <title>The behavioral approach for LPV data-driven representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present data-driven representations of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems that can be used for direct data-driven analysis and control of LPV systems. Specifically, we use the behavioral approach for LPV systems to develop a data-driven representation of the finite-horizon behavior of an LPV system that can be represented by a kernel representation with shifted-affine scheduling dependence. Moreover, we provide a necessary and sufficient rank-based test on the available data that concludes whether the data-driven representation fully represents the finite-horizon behavior. The results in this paper allow for direct data-driven analysis and control of LPV systems with stability and performance guarantees. We demonstrate this by also solving the LPV data-driven simulation problem. Moreover, through the use of LPV systems as surrogates for nonlinear systems, our results may serve as a stepping stone towards direct data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems.</description>

We examine pilot projects and business use cases, focusing on Building Integrated Vehicle Energy Solutions (BIVES) and Resilient Energy Storage and Backup (RESB) as stepping stones towards full Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) implementation. Our analysis highlights the feasibility, advantages, and challenges of implementing V2X in urban settings, underscoring its significant role in transitioning to a resilient, low-carbon urban energy system. The paper concludes with recommendations for addressing technical, regulatory, and business model challenges to accelerate V2X adoption in Dresden and beyond.</description>

      <title>RUL forecasting for wind turbine predictive maintenance based on deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is increasingly pursued to reduce wind farm operation and maintenance costs by accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) and strategically scheduling maintenance. However, the remoteness of wind farms often renders current methodologies ineffective, as they fail to provide a sufficiently reliable advance time window for maintenance planning, limiting PdM's practicality. This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL) methodology for future RUL forecasting. By employing a multi-parametric attention-based DL approach that bypasses feature engineering, thereby minimizing the risk of human error, two models: ForeNet-2d and ForeNet-3d are proposed. These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted wind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise forecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least accurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by only a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access remote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical implementation of PdM.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Wideband Study of Vegetation Impact on Upper Midband / FR3 Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing demand for high data rates is driving interest in the upper mid-band (FR 3) spectrum (6-24 GHz). While some propagation measurements exist in literature, the impact of vegetation on link performance remains under-explored. This study examines vegetation-induced losses in an urban scenario across 6-18 GHz. A simple method for calculating vegetation depth is introduced, along with a model that quantifies additional attenuation based on vegetation depth and frequency, divided into 1 GHz sub-bands. We see that excess vegetation loss increases with vegetation depth and higher frequencies. These findings provide insights for designing reliable, foliage-aware communication networks in FR 3.</description>

      <title>Network Models of Expertise in the Complex Task of Operating Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a network-based approach to study expertise in a complex real-world task: operating particle accelerators. Most real-world tasks we learn and perform (e.g., driving cars, operating complex machines, solving mathematical problems) are difficult to learn because they are complex, and the best strategies are difficult to find from many possibilities. However, how we learn such complex tasks remains a partially solved mystery, as we cannot explain how the strategies evolve with practice due to the difficulties of collecting and modeling complex behavioral data. As complex tasks are generally networks of many elementary subtasks, we model task performance as networks or graphs of subtasks and investigate how the networks change with expertise. We develop the networks by processing the text in a large archive of operator logs from 14 years of operations using natural language processing and machine learning. The network changes are examined using a set of measures at four levels of granularity - individual subtasks, interconnections among subtasks, groups of subtasks, and the whole complex task. We find that the operators consistently change with expertise at the subtask, the interconnection, and the whole-task levels, but they show remarkable similarity in how subtasks are grouped. These results indicate that the operators of all stages of expertise adopt a common divide-and-conquer approach by breaking the complex task into parts of manageable complexity, but they differ in the frequency and structure of nested subtasks. Operational logs are common data sources from real-world settings where people collaborate with hardware and software environments to execute complex tasks, and the network models investigated in this study can be expanded to accommodate multi-modal data. Therefore, our network-based approach provides a practical way to investigate expertise in the real world.</description>

      <title>Falsification of Autonomous Systems in Rich Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validating the behavior of autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, which rely on automated controllers, is an objective of great importance. In recent years, Neural-Network (NN) controllers have been demonstrating great promise. Unfortunately, such learned controllers are often not certified and can cause the system to suffer from unpredictable or unsafe behavior. To mitigate this issue, a great effort has been dedicated to automated verification of systems. Specifically, works in the category of ``black-box testing'' rely on repeated system simulations to find a falsifying counterexample of a system run that violates a specification. As running high-fidelity simulations is computationally demanding, the goal of falsification approaches is to minimize the simulation effort (NN inference queries) needed to return a falsifying example. This often proves to be a great challenge, especially when the tested controller is well-trained. This work contributes a novel falsification approach for autonomous systems under formal specification operating in uncertain environments. We are especially interested in CPS operating in rich, semantically-defined, open environments, which yield high-dimensional, simulation-dependent sensor observations. Our approach introduces a novel reformulation of the falsification problem as the problem of planning a trajectory for a ``meta-system,'' which wraps and encapsulates the examined system; we call this approach: meta-planning. This formulation can be solved with standard sampling-based motion-planning techniques (like RRT) and can gradually integrate domain knowledge to improve the search. We support the suggested approach with an experimental study on falsification of an obstacle-avoiding autonomous car with a NN controller, where meta-planning demonstrates superior performance over alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>A physics-engineering-economic model coupling approach for estimating the socio-economic impacts of space weather scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing concern about our vulnerability to space weather hazards and the disruption critical infrastructure failures could cause to society and the economy. However, the socio-economic impacts of space weather hazards, such as from geomagnetic storms, remain under-researched. This study introduces a novel framework to estimate the economic impacts of electricity transmission infrastructure failure due to space weather. By integrating existing geophysical and geomagnetically induced current (GIC) estimation models with a newly developed geospatial model of the Continental United States power grid, GIC vulnerabilities are assessed for a range of space weather scenarios. The approach evaluates multiple power network architectures, incorporating input-output economic modeling to translate business and population disruptions into macroeconomic impacts from GIC-related thermal heating failures. The results indicate a daily GDP loss from 6 billion USD to over 10 billion USD. Even under conservative GIC thresholds (75 A/ph) aligned with thermal withstand limits from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), significant economic disruptions are evident. This study is limited by its restriction to thermal heating analysis, though GICs can also affect the grid through other pathways, such as voltage instability and harmonic distortions. Addressing these other failure mechanisms need to be the focus of future research.</description>

      <title>A universal reproducing kernel Hilbert space for learning nonlinear systems operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of learning nonlinear operators that correspond to discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with inputs. Given an initial state and a finite input trajectory, such operators yield a finite output trajectory compatible with the system dynamics. Inspired by the universal approximation theorem of operators tailored to radial basis functions neural networks, we construct a class of kernel functions as the product of kernel functions in the space of input trajectories and initial states, respectively. We prove that for positive definite kernel functions, the resulting product reproducing kernel Hilbert space is dense and even complete in the space of nonlinear systems operators, under suitable assumptions. This provides a universal kernel-functions-based framework for learning nonlinear systems operators, which is intuitive and easy to apply to general nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A Time Optimization Framework for the Implementation of Robust and Low-latency Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has garnered attention for its potential to solve complex computational problems with considerable speedup. Despite notable advancements in the field, achieving meaningful scalability and noise control in quantum hardware remains challenging. Incoherent errors caused by decoherence restrict the total computation time, making it very short. While hardware advancements continue to progress, quantum software specialists seek to minimize quantum circuit latency to mitigate dissipation. However, at the pulse level, fast quantum gates often lead to leakage, leaving minimal room for further optimization. Recent advancements have shown the effectiveness of quantum control techniques in generating quantum gates robust to coherent error sources. Nevertheless, these techniques come with a trade-off -- extended gate durations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative pulse scheduling approach that enables the use of both fast and robust quantum gates within the same quantum circuit. The time-optimization framework models the quantum circuit as a dependency graph, implements the fastest quantum gates on the critical path, and uses idle periods outside the critical path to optimally implement longer, more robust gates from the gate set, without increasing latency. Experiments conducted on IBMQ Brisbane show that this approach improves the absolute success probability of quantum circuit execution by more than 25%, with performance gains scaling as the number of qubits increases.</description>

      <title>A Paragraph is All It Takes: Rich Robot Behaviors from Interacting, Trusted LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.</description>

      <title>A PAC-Bayesian Framework for Optimal Control with Stability Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) involves minimizing a cost function that averages out the random uncertainties affecting the dynamics of nonlinear systems. For tractability reasons, this problem is typically addressed by minimizing an empirical cost, which represents the average cost across a finite dataset of sampled disturbances. However, this approach raises the challenge of quantifying the control performance against out-of-sample uncertainties. Particularly, in scenarios where the training dataset is small, SNOC policies are prone to overfitting, resulting in significant discrepancies between the empirical cost and the true cost, i.e., the average SNOC cost incurred during control deployment. Therefore, establishing generalization bounds on the true cost is crucial for ensuring reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that leverages PAC-Bayes theory to provide rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Based on these bounds, we propose a new method for designing optimal controllers, offering a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge into the synthesis process, which aids in improving the control policy and mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, by leveraging recent parametrizations of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems, our framework inherently ensures closed-loop stability. The effectiveness of our proposed method in incorporating prior knowledge and combating overfitting is shown by designing neural network controllers for tasks in cooperative robotics.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Economic Dispatch with Flexible Loads and RES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain the supply-demand balance of power systems by solely relying on the generation side. To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market. Through multiple case studies, we show that MDF from load aggregators can reduce the volatility of LMPs. In addition, we identify the values of the different flexibilities in the MDF bids, which provide useful insights into the design of more complex MDF markets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With more renewable energy sources (RES) integrated into the power system, the intermittency of RES places a heavy burden on the system. The uncertainty of RES is traditionally handled by controllable generators to balance the real time wind power deviation. As the demand side management develops, the flexibility of aggregate loads can be leveraged to mitigate the negative impact of the wind power. In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility. We transform the original optimization problem into a convex one using surrogate affine approximation such that it can be solved efficiently. In case studies, we apply our model on a six-bus transmission network and demonstrate that how flexible load aggregators can help to determine the optimal admissible region for the wind power deviations.</description>

      <title>Estimating Potential Demand and Customers' Perception of Service Value in a Two-station Service System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential demand in the market and customers' perception of service value are crucial factors in pricing strategies, resource allocation, and other operational decisions. However, this information is typically private and not readily accessible. In this paper, we analyze a service system operating across two stations, each with its own customer flow. Customers arriving at the system are informed of the waiting times at both stations and can choose to either join the local station, switch to the other station, or balk. Our objective is to estimate the arrival rates at each station and customers' perceived service value based on the observed workloads at both stations. A significant challenge arises from the inability to observe balking customers and the lack of distinction between local arrivals and customers switching from the other station, as the switching cost is unknown. To address this issue, we employ maximum likelihood estimation and validate the effectiveness of the estimator through a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>On Algorithms verifying Initial-and-Final-State Opacity: Complexity, Special Cases, and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Opacity is a general framework modeling security properties of systems interacting with a passive attacker. Initial-and-final-state opacity (IFO) generalizes the classical notions of opacity, such as current-state opacity and initial-state opacity. In IFO, the secret is whether the system evolved from a given initial state to a given final state or not. There are two algorithms for IFO verification. One arises from a trellis-based state estimator, which builds a semigroup of binary relations generated by the events of the automaton, and the other is based on the reduction to language inclusion. The time complexity of both algorithms is bounded by a super-exponential function, and it is a challenging open problem to find a faster algorithm or to show that no faster algorithm exists. We discuss the lower-bound time complexity for both general and special cases, and use extensive benchmarks to compare the existing algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a powerful approach for developing traversability models for off-road navigation, but these models often struggle with inputs unseen during training. Existing methods utilize techniques like evidential deep learning to quantify model uncertainty, helping to identify and avoid out-of-distribution terrain. However, always avoiding out-of-distribution terrain can be overly conservative, e.g., when novel terrain can be effectively analyzed using a physics-based model. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Physics-Informed Evidential Traversability (PIETRA), a self-supervised learning framework that integrates physics priors directly into the mathematical formulation of evidential neural networks and introduces physics knowledge implicitly through an uncertainty-aware, physics-informed training loss. Our evidential network seamlessly transitions between learned and physics-based predictions for out-of-distribution inputs. Additionally, the physics-informed loss regularizes the learned model, ensuring better alignment with the physics model. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that PIETRA improves both learning accuracy and navigation performance in environments with significant distribution shifts.</description>
