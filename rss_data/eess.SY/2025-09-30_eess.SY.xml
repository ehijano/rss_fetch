      <title>Safe and Stable Control via Lyapunov-Guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in recent years, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in planning and control tasks. However, most diffusion-based policies remain focused on reward maximization or cost minimization, often overlooking critical aspects of safety and stability. In this work, we propose Safe and Stable Diffusion ($S^2$Diff), a model-based diffusion framework that explores how diffusion models can ensure safety and stability from a Lyapunov perspective. We demonstrate that $S^2$Diff eliminates the reliance on both complex gradient-based solvers (e.g., quadratic programming, non-convex solvers) and control-affine structures, leading to globally valid control policies driven by the learned certificate functions. Additionally, we uncover intrinsic connections between diffusion sampling and Almost Lyapunov theory, enabling the use of trajectory-level control policies to learn better certificate functions for safety and stability guarantees. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on a wide variety of dynamical control systems, where $S^2$Diff consistently outperforms both certificate-based controllers and model-based diffusion baselines in terms of safety, stability, and overall control performance.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Incidents and Congestion with Implications for Sustainable Traffic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic anomalies such as collisions and disruptions threaten the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation systems. We present a simulation-based framework for modeling, detecting, and predicting such anomalies in urban networks. Using the SUMO platform, we generate reproducible rear-end and intersection crash scenarios with matched baselines, enabling controlled experimentation and comparative evaluation. We record vehicle-level travel time, speed, and emissions for edge and network-level analysis. On this dataset, we develop a hybrid forecasting architecture that combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks with a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network to capture temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies. Our simulation studies on the Broadway corridor in New York City demonstrate the framework's ability to reproduce consistent incident conditions, quantify their effects, and provide accurate multi-horizon traffic forecasts. Our results highlight the value of combining controlled anomaly generation with deep predictive models to support reproducible evaluation and sustainable traffic management.</description>

      <title>From Legacy to Leadership Intelligent Radio Network Planning Framework for Cell-Free Massive MIMO in B5G6G Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of cell-free Massive MIMO represents a transformative shift in wireless network architecture, addressing critical limitations of conventional distributed Massive MIMO systems. This paper presents an intelligent radio network planning framework that bridges legacy 5G infrastructures with future B5G/6G networks through cell-free architectures. By leveraging operational insights from existing 5G deployments, we systematically address coverage optimization, and capacity enhancement. Our scalable framework enables seamless evolution from legacy designs to next-generation cell-free systems. Through extensive simulations in dense urban environments, we demonstrate substantial improvements: 45% spectral efficiency gains, 30% interference reduction, and significantly enhanced uniform coverage. The proposed framework provides network operators with a practical roadmap for transitioning from traditional cellular architectures to demanding B5G/6G requirements while maximizing existing infrastructure investments.</description>

      <title>Modular Design of Strict Control Lyapunov Functions for Global Stabilization of the Unicycle in Polar Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that, unlike in Cartesian form where Brockett's condition rules out static feedback stabilization, the unicycle is globally asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback in polar coordinates. In this note, we introduce a modular framework for designing smooth feedback laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization in polar coordinates. These laws are bidirectional, enabling efficient parking maneuvers, and are paired with families of strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) constructed in a modular fashion. The resulting CLFs guarantee global asymptotic stability with explicit convergence rates and include barrier variants that yield "almost global" stabilization, excluding only zero-measure subsets of the rotation manifolds. The strictness of the CLFs is further leveraged in our companion paper, where we develop inverse-optimal redesigns with meaningful cost functions and infinite gain margins.</description>

      <title>Integrator Forwading Design for Unicycles with Constant and Actuated Velocity in Polar Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a companion paper, we present a modular framework for unicycle stabilization in polar coordinates that provides smooth steering laws through backstepping. Surprisingly, the same problem also allows the application of integrator forwarding. In this work, we leverage this feature and construct new smooth steering laws together with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), expanding the set of CLFs available for inverse optimal control design. In the case of constant forward velocity (Dubins car), backstepping produces finite-time (deadbeat) parking, and we show that integrator forwarding yields the very same class of solutions. This reveals a fundamental connection between backstepping and forwarding in addressing both the unicycle and, the Dubins car parking problems.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)-Enabled UAV Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery framework is proposed, which exploits the capability of PASS to establish a strong line-of-sight link and reduce free-space pathloss.Aiming at minimizing the communication energy consumption in one cycle, a double-layer optimization (DLO) algorithm is developed by jointly optimizing the UAV delivery sequence and the pinching antenna (PA) activation vector. More specifically, at the outer layer, a hierarchical alternating optimization (HAO) scheme is proposed to tackle the NP-hard problem of delivery sequence planning, where a genetic algorithm performs global exploration to generate candidate solutions at the top-level, while a dynamic programming performs local refinement to obtain elite solutions at the lower-level. With determined UAV trajectory, at the inner layer, focus is placed on addressing the highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem of PA activation vector optimization, where a pair of algorithms are proposed: 1) Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm for finding global optimum; 2) incremental search and local refinement (ISLR) algorithm for reducing computational complexity. Simulation results indicate that: i) The proposed HAO-based delivery sequence planning scheme can effectively reduce the total flight distance, thereby decreasing flight time and communication energy consumption; ii) Both the proposed BnB and ISLR algorithms can achieve energy-efficient PA activation, with the former exhibiting better performance and the latter having lower complexity; iii) PASS outperforms the conventional multi-antenna systems, especially with higher communication rate requirements.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Causal Attack Graph based Cyber-security Risk Assessment Framework for CTCS System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting the security of the train control system is a critical issue to ensure the safe and reliable operation of high-speed trains. Scientific modeling and analysis for the security risk is a promising way to guarantee system security. However, the representation and assessment of the multi-staged, causally related, and temporal-dynamic changed attack dependencies are difficult in the train control system. To solve the above challenges, a security assessment framework based on the Dynamical Causality Attack Graph (DCAG) model is introduced in this paper. Firstly, the DCAG model is generated based on the attack graph with consideration of temporal attack propagation and multi-stage attack event causality propagation. Then, the DCAG model is analyzed based on Bayesian inference and logic gateway-based inference. Through the case analysis of the CTCS-3 system, the security assessment framework is validated. With the DCAG-based security assessment framework, we can not only perform appropriate security risk quantification calculations, but also explore the importance of different attacks on system security risks, which is helpful in adjusting the cyber security defense policy.</description>

      <title>Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</description>

      <title>Assessment of East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N) facing Vertical Bifacial Photovoltaic Modules for Agrivoltaics and Dual-Land Use Applications in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying vertical bifacial PV modules can play a significant role in agrivoltaics, fencing walls, noise barriers, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar PV for electric vehicles, and many other applications. This research work presents the performance comparison of vertical bifacial photovoltaic (VBPV) modules facing East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N) directions. Also, the VBPV modules are compared with vertical and tilted south-facing monofacial PV modules. Six PV modules (monofacial and bifacial) were installed at the rooftop of IIT Bhilai academic building, Raipur (21.16{\deg} N, 81.65{\deg} E), India, and studied for a year from May 2022 to April 2023. The results show that the E-W facing VBPV module gives two production peaks, one in the morning and another in the evening, as compared to the single notable rise at midday observed for a monofacial module. From a series of experiments, 19 days of data were collected over the one-year period from May 2022 to April 2023, with specific inclusion of important days like solstices and equinoxes. In addition, the energy generation results are compared with PVsyst simulations, while also addressing the limitations of the PVsyst simulation of vertical PV modules. E-W bifacial generation is higher than S-N bifacial and south-facing monofacial modules from February to April. The VBPV modules in E-W and S-N orientations present a promising opportunity for expanding the agrivoltaics sector in tropical and sub-tropical countries, like India. This has huge implications for addressing the sustainable development goals by simultaneously contributing to sustainable land management, green energy generation, energy security and water conservation in the vast geo-climatic expanse of tropics.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of nonlinear systems with unknown delays via delay-adaptive neural operator approximate predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable. We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable, and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline fixed-point method.</description>

      <title>Anticipatory Structure in the Propagation of Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here report the development of a structure that shows the proteresis phenomenon in more general setting and set out its philosophical implications. In this case, the questions relate to how we are to interpret what will happen in the future, and the procollection (the counterpart of recollection) of not-yet-experienced phenomena that, when expressed, will be whatever has built up in fully determinate form already, ahead of the event. If such a process really exists, as our evidence confirms, not just as phenomenon but as a fact, then a gap exists between the actualized form of the future and its concrete expression when the event does happen. Such a fact, as hard to imagine as it is, may be intelligible, even interpretable and susceptible to mathematical and/or logical modeling. We build upon neglected theories and formulae that present time in a way that makes our results interpretable. A proteretic device is here described which shifts the input signal (event) to the future; and it is an anticipatory structure. The proteretic characteristic of neurons should also be capable of demonstration; and its neuronal behavior is possibly the reason for the fast perception/thought processes in spite of slow behaving neurons. That capacity may also account for why it is possible for animals (including humans) to interact with the environment by slightly seeing (in the sense of perceiving and/or sensing) the future. Exploiting this new proteretic technology, faster computers and more efficient cellphones, among other things, will be designed and built.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-based Co-design of Output-Feedback Control Barrier Function and Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a powerful framework for ensuring safety in dynamical systems. However, their application typically relies on full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller, observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.</description>

      <title>Robust Safety-Critical Control of Integrator Chains with Mismatched Perturbations via Linear Time-Varying Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel safety-critical control framework for a chain of integrators subject to both matched and mismatched perturbations. The core of our approach is a linear, time-varying state-feedback design that simultaneously enforces stability and safety constraints. By integrating backstepping techniques with a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, we develop a systematic procedure to guarantee safety under time-varying gains. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the double integrator case, both in the presence and absence of perturbations, and outline general proofs for extending the methodology to higher-order chains of integrators. This proposed framework thus bridges robustness and safety-critical performance, while overcoming the limitations of existing prescribed-time approaches.</description>

      <title>Energy-Optimal Planning of Waypoint-Based UAV Missions -- Does Minimum Distance Mean Minimum Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a prevailing type of aerial robots with wide real-world applications. The energy efficiency of the robot is a critical aspect of its performance, determining the range and duration of the missions that can be performed. This paper studies the energy-optimal planning of the multirotor, which aims at finding the optimal ordering of waypoints with the minimum energy consumption for missions in 3D space. The study is performed based on a previously developed model capturing first-principle energy dynamics of the multirotor. We found that in majority of the cases (up to 95%) the solutions of the energy-optimal planning are different from those of the traditional traveling salesman problem which minimizes the total distance. The difference can be as high as 14.9%, with the average at 1.6%-3.3% and 90th percentile at 3.7%-6.5% depending on the range and number of waypoints in the mission. We then identified and explained the key features of the minimum-energy order by correlating to the underlying flight energy dynamics. It is shown that instead of minimizing the distance, coordination of vertical and horizontal motion to promote aerodynamic efficiency is the key to optimizing energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Neo-Grounded Theory: A Methodological Innovation Integrating High-Dimensional Vector Clustering and Multi-Agent Collaboration for Qualitative Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor. Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement. Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks), superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions. Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight. Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative research's humanistic commitments.

      <title>AW-EL-PINNs: A Multi-Task Learning Physics-Informed Neural Network for Euler-Lagrange Systems in Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents adaptive weighted Euler-Lagrange theorem combined physics-informed neural networks (AW-EL-PINNs) for solving Euler-Lagrange systems in optimal control problems. The framework systematically converts optimal control frameworks into two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) while establishing a multi-task learning paradigm through innovative integration of the Euler-Lagrange theorem with deep learning architecture. An adaptive loss weighting mechanism dynamically balances loss function components during training, decreasing tedious manual tuning of weighting the loss functions compared to the conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Based on six numerical examples, it's clear that AW-EL-PINNs achieve enhanced solution accuracy compared to baseline methods while maintaining stability throughout the optimization process. These results highlight the framework's capability to improve precision and ensure stability in solving Euler-Lagrange systems in optimal control problems, offering potential strategies for problems under physical applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Energy-Theft Attack on Frequency-Varying Wireless Power without Additional Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the popularity of wireless charging, energy access protection and cybersecurity are gaining importance, especially in public places. Currently, the most common energy encryption method uses frequency and associated impedance variation. However, we have proven that this method is not reliable, since a hacker can detect the changing frequency and adjust the compensation. However, the previously presented system needed time to follow the updated frequency, while encryption systems may vary the frequency faster to avoid energy theft. Furthermore, the previous system required an additional sensor coil. To solve these problems, we optimized the attack and the associated system, which can intrude and steal energy within 0.2 ms. The key is the elimination of the time-consuming maximum receiver current regulation. Also, we use the main receiving coil rather than any additional sensor antenna to detect the magnetic field. Thus, the new hardware is even simpler. A simulation model and experimental results demonstrate the fast response speed of the attack on encrypted wireless power and steal 65% of the power. Overall, the applicability of the attack is highly improved and leaves less room for hardening the encryption. The results demonstrate that energy access protection needs to be given great attention.</description>

      <title>Environmental Rate Manipulation Attacks on Power Grid Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of global supply chains has made hardware Trojans a significant threat in sensor-based power electronics. Traditional Trojan designs depend on digital triggers or fixed threshold conditions that can be detected during standard testing. In contrast, we introduce Environmental Rate Manipulation (ERM), a novel Trojan triggering mechanism that activates by monitoring the rate of change in environmental parameters rather than their absolute values. This approach allows the Trojan to remain inactive under normal conditions and evade redundancy and sensor-fusion defenses. We implement a compact 14~$\mu$m$^2$ circuit that measures capacitor charging rates in standard sensor front-ends and disrupts inverter pulse-width modulation PWM signals when a rapid change is induced. Experiments on a commercial Texas Instruments solar inverter demonstrate that ERM can trigger catastrophic driver chip failure. Furthermore, ETAP simulations indicate that a single compromised 100~kW inverter may initiate cascading grid instabilities. The attack's significance extends beyond individual sensors to entire classes of environmental sensing systems common in power electronics, demonstrating fundamental challenges for hardware security.</description>

      <title>Message passing-based inference in an autoregressive active inference agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive-Serve-Longest Control for Multi-robot Scheduling Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Feedback and Gain Margins for Unicycle Stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of globally strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for the challenging unicycle parking problem provides a foundation for pursuing optimality. We address this in the inverse optimal framework, thereby avoiding the need to solve the Hamilton$\unicode{x2013}$Jacobi$\unicode{x2013}$Bellman (HJB) equations, and establish a general result that is optimal with respect to a meaningful cost. We present several design examples that impose varying levels of penalty on the control effort, including arbitrarily bounded control. Furthermore, we show that the inverse optimal controller possesses an infinite gain margin thanks to the system being driftless, and leveraging this property, we extend the design to an adaptive controller that handles model uncertainty. Finally, we compare the performance of the non-adaptive inverse optimal controller with its adaptive counterpart.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Detection of Spatiotemporal Anomalies in PMU Data Using Transformer-Based BiGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution. Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence. Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually labeled fault data.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization in Robust Control: Weak Convexity and Subgradient Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust control seeks stabilizing policies that perform reliably under adversarial disturbances, with $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control as a classical formulation. It is known that policy optimization of robust $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control naturally lead to nonsmooth and nonconvex problems. This paper builds on recent advances in nonsmooth optimization to analyze discrete-time static output-feedback $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. We show that the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ cost is weakly convex over any convex subset of a sublevel set. This structural property allows us to establish the first non-asymptotic deterministic convergence rate for the subgradient method under suitable assumptions. In addition, we prove a weak Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality in the state-feedback case, implying that all stationary points are globally optimal. We finally present a few numerical examples to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also quantified uncertainty to support planning, control, and radio resource management. We formulate localization as posterior inference of an unknown transmitter location from receiver measurements. We propose Monte Carlo Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations. We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current control techniques for cryogenically cooled qubits are realized with coaxial cables, posing multiple challenges in terms of cost, thermal load, size, and long-term scalability. Emerging approaches to tackle this issue include cryogenic CMOS electronics at 4 K, and photonic links for direct qubit control. In this paper, we propose a multiplexed all-passive cryogenic high frequency direct detection control platform (cryo-HFDD). The proposed classical interface for direct qubit control utilizes optical or sub-THz bands. We present the possible tradeoffs of this platform, and compare it with current state-of-the-art cryogenic CMOS and conventional coaxial approaches. We assess the feasibility of adopting these efficient links for a wide range of microwave qubit power levels. Specifically, we estimate the heat load to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio SNR considering different noise sources, component losses, as well as link density. We show that multiplexed photonic receivers at 4 K can aggressively scale the control of thousands of qubits. This opens the door for low cost scalable quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Multi-link EDCA Optimization for Delay-Bounded QoS in Wi-Fi 7</title>

Abstract: IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO) as a While MLO offers significant parallelism and capacity, realizing its full potential in guaranteeing strict delay bounds and optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) for diverse, heterogeneous traffic streams in complex multi-link scenarios remain a significant challenge. This is largely due to the limitations of static Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) parameters and the complexity inherent in cross-link traffic management. To address this, this paper investigates the correlation between overall MLO QoS indicators and the configuration of EDCA parameters and Acess Catagory (AC) traffic allocation among links. Based on this analysis, we formulate a constrained optimization problem aiming to minimize the sum of overall packet loss rates for all access categories while satisfying their respective overall delay violation probability constraints. A Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based MLO EDCA QoS optimization algorithm is designed to efficiently search the complex configuration space of AC assignments and EDCA parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach's efficacy in generating adaptive MLO configuration strategies that align with diverse service requirements. The proposed solution significantly improves delay distribution characteristics, and enhance QoS robustness and resource utilization efficiency in high-load MLO environments.</description>

      <title>LiDAR Point Cloud Colourisation Using Multi-Camera Fusion and Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would otherwise remain undetectable.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.</description>

      <title>Robust NbN on Si-SiGe hybrid superconducting-semiconducting microwave quantum circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing large-scale quantum computing requires superconducting circuits that combine long coherence times with compatibility with semiconductor technology. We investigate niobium nitride (NbN) coplanar waveguide resonators integrated with Si/SiGe quantum wells, creating a hybrid platform designed for CMOS-compatible quantum hardware. Using temperature-dependent microwave spectroscopy in the single-photon regime, we examine resonance frequency and quality factor variations to probe the underlying loss mechanisms. Our analysis identifies the roles of two-level systems, quasiparticles, and scattering processes, and connects these losses to wafer properties and fabrication methods. The devices demonstrate reproducible performance and stable operation maintained for over two years, highlighting their robustness. These results provide design guidelines for developing low-loss, CMOS-compatible superconducting circuits and support progress toward resilient, scalable architectures for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Real-time Velocity Profile Optimization for Time-Optimal Maneuvering with Generic Acceleration Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths, subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However, the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FB_public_RAL.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Resilient ML-Based Physical-Layer Attack Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of emerging attacks on network infrastructure is a critical aspect of security management. To meet the growing scale and complexity of modern threats, machine learning (ML) techniques offer valuable tools for automating the detection of malicious activities. However, as these techniques become more complex, their internal operations grow increasingly opaque. In this context, we address the need for explainable physical-layer attack detection methods. First, we analyze the inner workings of various classifiers trained to alert about physical layer intrusions, examining how the influence of different monitored parameters varies depending on the type of attack being detected. This analysis not only improves the interpretability of the models but also suggests ways to enhance their design for increased speed. In the second part, we evaluate the detectors' resilience to malicious parameter noising. The results highlight a key trade-off between model speed and resilience. This work serves as a design guideline for developing fast and robust detectors trained on available network monitoring data.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Thermohaline Convection With a Time-Varying Shear Flow Using the Lyapunov Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work identifies instabilities and computes the growth rate of a linear time-varying system using the Lyapunov method. The linear system describes cold fresh water on top of hot salty water with a periodically time-varying background shear flow. We employ a time-dependent weighting matrix to construct a Lyapunov function candidate, and the resulting linear matrix inequalities formulation is discretized in time using the forward Euler method. As the number of temporal discretization points increases, the growth rate predicted from the Lyapunov method or the Floquet theory will converge to the same value as that obtained from numerical simulations. We also use the Lyapunov method to analyze the instantaneous principal direction of instabilities and compare the computational resources required by the Lyapunov method, numerical simulations, and the Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>OmniRetarget: Interaction-Preserving Data Generation for Humanoid Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Scene Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.</description>

      <title>On Fixed-Time Stability for a Class of Singularly Perturbed Systems using Composite Lyapunov Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-time stable dynamical systems are capable of achieving exact convergence to an equilibrium point within a fixed time that is independent of the initial conditions of the system. This property makes them highly appealing for designing control, estimation, and optimization algorithms in applications with stringent performance requirements. However, the set of tools available for analyzing the interconnection of fixed-time stable systems is rather limited compared to their asymptotic counterparts. In this paper, we address some of these limitations by exploiting the emergence of multiple time scales in nonlinear singularly perturbed dynamical systems, where the fast dynamics and the slow dynamics are fixed-time stable on their own. By extending the so-called composite Lyapunov method from asymptotic stability to the context of fixed-time stability, we provide a novel class of Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions to certify fixed-time stability in a class of singularly perturbed dynamical systems. The results are illustrated, analytically and numerically, using a fixed-time gradient flow system interconnected with a fixed-time plant and an additional high-order example.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator Feedback for a First-Order PIDE with Spatially-Varying State Delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transport PDE with a spatial integral and recirculation with constant delay has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input -- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time' function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Estimation of Structured Singular Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the size of the modeling error is crucial for robust control. Over the years, numerous metrics have been developed to quantify the model error in a control relevant manner. One of the most important such metrics is the structured singular value, as it leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring stability and robustness in feedback control under structured model uncertainty. Although the computation of the structured singular value is often intractable, lower and upper bounds for it can often be obtained if a model of the system is known. In this paper, we introduce a fully data-driven method to estimate a lower bound for the structured singular value, by conducting experiments on the system and applying power iterations to the collected data. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this method effectively lower bounds the structured singular value, yielding results comparable to the MATLAB$^\copyright$ Robust Control Toolbox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00321v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback optimization algorithms compute inputs to a system using real-time output measurements, which helps mitigate the effects of disturbances. However, existing work often models both system dynamics and computations in either discrete or continuous time, which may not accurately model some applications. In this work, we model linear system dynamics in continuous time, and we model the computations of inputs in discrete time. Therefore, we present a novel hybrid systems model of feedback optimization. We first establish the well-posedness of this hybrid model and establish completeness of solutions while ruling out Zeno behavior. Then we show the state of the system converges exponentially fast to a ball of known radius about a desired goal state. Next we analytically show that this system is robust to perturbations in (i) the values of measured outputs, (ii) the matrices that model the linear time-invariant system, and (iii) the times at which inputs are applied to the system. Simulation results confirm that this approach successfully mitigates the effects of disturbances.</description>

      <title>Edge Server Monitoring for Job Assignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where compute jobs arrive intermittently at dispatchers and must be immediately assigned to distributed edge servers. Due to competing workloads and the dynamic nature of the edge environment, server availability fluctuates over time. To maintain accurate estimates of server availability states, each dispatcher updates its belief using two mechanisms: (i) active queries over shared communication channels and (ii) feedback from past job executions. We formulate a query scheduling problem that maximizes the job success rate under limited communication resources for queries. This problem is modeled as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) with multiple actions and addressed using a Net-Gain Maximization (NGM) scheduling algorithm, which selects servers to query based on their expected improvement in execution performance. Simulation results show that the proposed NGM Policy significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to a 30% gain over the Round-Robin Policy and up to a 107% gain over the Never-Query Policy.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving an unprecedented increase in the electricity demand of AI data centers, raising emerging challenges for electric power grids. Understanding the characteristics of AI data center loads and their interactions with the grid is therefore critical for ensuring both reliable power system operation and sustainable AI development. This paper provides a comprehensive review and vision of this evolving landscape. Specifically, this paper (i) presents an overview of AI data center infrastructure and its key components, (ii) examines the key characteristics and patterns of electricity demand across the stages of model preparation, training, fine-tuning, and inference, (iii) analyzes the critical challenges that AI data center loads pose to power systems across three interrelated timescales, including long-term planning and interconnection, short-term operation and electricity markets, and real-time dynamics and stability, and (iv) discusses potential solutions from the perspectives of the grid, AI data centers, and AI end-users to address these challenges. By synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions, this review aims to guide research and development in support of the joint advancement of AI data centers and power systems toward reliable, efficient, and sustainable operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where jobs arrive intermittently at multiple dispatchers and must be assigned to shared edge servers with finite queues and time-varying availability. Accurate knowledge of server status is critical for sustaining high throughput, yet remains challenging under dynamic workloads and partial observability. To address this challenge, each dispatcher maintains server knowledge through two complementary mechanisms: (i) active status queries that provide instantaneous updates at a communication cost, and (ii) job execution feedback that reveals server conditions upon successful or failed job completion. We formulate a cooperative multi-agent distributed decision-making problem in which dispatchers jointly optimize query scheduling to balance throughput against communication overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm that leverages centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) to learn distributed query-and-dispatch policies under partial and stale observations. Experiments show that MAPPO achieves superior throughput-cost tradeoffs and significantly outperforms baseline strategies across varying query costs, job arrival rates, and dispatchers.</description>

      <title>Parasitic actuation delay limits the minimum employable time headway in connected and autonomous vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive andcooperative adaptive cruise control (ACC and CACC) and next generation CACC (CACC+) systems usually employ a constant time headway policy (CTHP) for platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In ACC, the ego vehicle uses onboard sensors to measure the position and velocity of the predecessor vehicle to maintain a desired spacing. The CACC and CACC+systems use additional information, such as acceleration(s) communicated through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of the predecessor vehicle(s); these systems have been shown to result in improved spacing performance, throughput, and safety over ACC. Parasitic dynamics are generally difficult to model and the parasitic parameters (delay, lag, etc.) are difficult to obtain. Parasitic actuation delays can have deleterious effects and impose limits on the mobility and safety of CAVs. It is reasonable to assume that the bounds on parasitic actuation delays are known a priori. For CAVs, we need to address both internal stability and string stability in the presence of parasitic actuation delays. This requires robustness of string and internal stability for all values of parasitic actuation delays that are within the specified upper bound. In this paper, we provide the minimum employable time headway for ACC, CACC, and CACC+ (`r' predecessors look-ahead), respectively. The inclusion of the internal stability in the string stability condition is analyzed based on Pontryagin's interlacing theorem for time delay systems. We provide comparative numerical results to corroborate the achieved theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances, complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing several existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Control via Sparsity-Promoting Regularization: A Rollout Approach with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a controller design framework aiming to balance control performance and actuation rate. Control performance is evaluated by an infinite-horizon average cost, and the number of control actions is penalized via sparsity-promoting regularization. Since the formulated optimal control problem has a combinatorial nature, we employ a rollout algorithm to obtain a tractable suboptimal solution. In the proposed scheme, actuation timings are determined through a multistage minimization procedure based on a receding-horizon approach, and the corresponding control inputs are computed online. We establish theoretical performance guarantees with respect to periodic control and prove the stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>RobustNeuralNetworks.jl: a Package for Machine Learning and Data-Driven Control with Certified Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are typically sensitive to small input perturbations, leading to unexpected or brittle behaviour. We present RobustNeuralNetworks.jl: a Julia package for neural network models that are constructed to naturally satisfy a set of user-defined robustness metrics. The package is based on the recently proposed Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) and Lipschitz-Bounded Deep Network (LBDN) model classes, and is designed to interface directly with Julia's most widely-used machine learning package, Flux.jl. We discuss the theory behind our model parameterization, give an overview of the package, and provide a tutorial demonstrating its use in image classification, reinforcement learning, and nonlinear state-observer design.</description>

      <title>Optimal transmission expansion modestly reduces decarbonization costs of U.S. electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expanding interregional transmission is widely viewed as essential for integrating clean energy into decarbonized power systems. Using the open-source Switch capacity expansion model with detailed representation of existing U.S. generation and transmission infrastructure, solar, wind, and storage resources, and hourly operations, we evaluate the role of transmission across least-cost, socially optimal, and zero-emissions scenarios for 2050. An optimal nationwide plan would more than triple interregional transmission capacity, yet this reduces the cost of a zero-emissions system by only 7% relative to relying on existing transmission, as storage, solar and wind siting, and nuclear generation serve as close substitutes. Regional cost and rent effects vary, with transmission generally favoring wind and hydrogen resources over solar and batteries. Sensitivity analysis shows diminishing returns: one-fifth of the benefits of full expansion can be achieved with one-twelfth of the added capacity, while cost reductions for batteries and hydrogen provide comparable or greater system savings than transmission. Reconductoring -- quadrupling line capacity at half the cost of new builds achieves nearly all the benefits of unconstrained expansion. These results suggest that while substantial transmission expansion is economically justified, a diverse set of flexibility resources can substitute for large-scale grid build-out, and the relative value of transmission is highly contingent on technological and cost developments.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Clutch-Based Mechanical Multiplexer with Increased Force Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems with many degrees of freedom (DoF) are constrained by the demands of dedicating a motor to each joint, and while mechanical multiplexing reduces actuator count, existing clutch designs are bulky, force-limited, or restricted to one output at a time. The problem addressed in this study is how to achieve high-force, multiplexing that supports both simultaneous and sequential control from a single motor. Here we show an electrostatic capstan clutch-based transmission that enables both single-input-single-output (SISO) and single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) multiplexing. We demonstrated these on a four-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand where a single motor achieved output forces up to 212 N, increased vertical grip strength by 4.09 times, and raised horizontal carrying capacity by 354\% over manufacturer specifications. These results demonstrate that electrostatic multiplexing provides versatile actuation, overcoming the limitations of prior systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimized dynamic scheduling of an exclusive bus lane or high occupancy vehicle lane in a bimodal traffic corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient management of traffic corridors is critical for sustaining urban mobility. Exclusive bus lane (EBL) and high occupancy vehicle lane (HOVL) are two prominent strategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes for faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies may underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic implementation, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize road efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study first compares the mixed traffic policy (MTP), exclusive bus lane policy (EBLP), and high occupancy vehicle lane policy (HOVLP) by formulating the total system costs in the context of a bimodal traffic corridor involving private cars and public buses. Under each lane policy, the bus frequency is optimized together with the modal split equilibrium derived separately. Based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process, switching thresholds are then derived to identify optimal periods for implementing each policy. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the proposed dynamic policy schedules. Compared to static implementations, the dynamic policy schedules achieve cost reductions of 11.9%, 6.70%, and 43.64% relative to MTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in two real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations in Seattle, the proposed dynamic policy reduces total costs by 32.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a robust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL policies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.</description>

      <title>Ocean Diviner: A Diffusion-Augmented Reinforcement Learning Framework for AUV Robust Control in Underwater Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are essential for marine exploration, yet their control remains highly challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and uncertain environmental disturbances. This paper presents a diffusion-augmented Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for robust AUV control, aiming to improve AUV's adaptability in dynamic underwater environments. The proposed framework integrates two core innovations: (1) A diffusion-based action generation framework that produces physically feasible and high-quality actions, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving long-horizon planning capacity for robust control. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects the optimal action, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validate the framework's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforming conventional control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in underwater tasks. Finally, we will release the code publicly soon to support future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</description>

      <title>MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.</description>

      <title>Simulated Annealing for Multi-Robot Ergodic Information Acquisition Using Graph-Based Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.</description>
