      <title>Multiscale Mechanical Response of 3D-Printed Diamondiynes: From Movable Interlocked Lattices to Architected Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamondynes are a recently synthesized three-dimensional carbon allotrope, with interlocked and movable sublattices that introduce deformation modes not present in standard architected materials. Here, we report the first multiscale mechanical assessment of Diamondiyne-derived architectures by combining quasi-static compression of 3D-printed specimens with reactive molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding atomic-scale models. We generate four geometries (3F, 2F-SY, 4F, and 2F-USY). All structures resulted in lower density in the range of 0.20-0.38 g.cm^-3. Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-1.cm^-3 and 16 J.g^-1. The 4F geometry provided a specific energy absorption of 254 J.g^-1. The structures deformed through geometric collapse and strut buckling, which was due to diagonal shear in 2F-USY and progressive compaction in 2F-SY and 3F. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture. Overall, Diamondiyne-derived architectures display geometry-dominated mechanical behavior and serve as a promising platform for lightweight, energy-absorbing metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Substrate-Voltage-Controlled Temporal Nonlinearity in Ferroelectric FET-based Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing exploits inherent nonlinearity and short-term memory of physical dynamics to achieve efficient processing of time-series data with extremely-low training cost. In this study, we demonstrate a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based reservoir computing system with augmented temporal and spatial nonlinearity by utilizing both gate and substrate terminals as inputs. The ferroelectric polarization state in the next time step can additionally be controlled by modifying the electric field distribution in the gate stack of FeFET through a substrate input, enabling more diverse internal states compared with the case where inputs are applied only to the gate. To introduce a nonlinearity in the time domain, we introduce a delay between a gate input and a substrate input, which facilitates efficient nonlinear mixing between the current and past inputs. As a result, both the short-term memory and nonlinearity of the FeFET reservoir computing system are enhanced with an improved capability of feature extraction of complex input time-series. These findings demonstrate that introducing substrate input provides an additional degree of freedom for controlling ferroelectric polarization dynamics, enabling a flexible, energy-efficient, and highly integrable FeFET-based reservoir computing platform suitable for diverse time-series processing applications.</description>

      <title>Physics Guided Exponential Model Design of High Ge Content SiGe Selective Epitaxy for Gate All Around Source/Drain Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High germanium content silicon germanium (SiGe) epitaxy is critical for strain engineering in advanced gate all around (GAA) transistors. This paper demonstrates a physics guided exponential function model that quantitatively links selective epitaxial growth (SEG) parameters to Ge incorporation kinetics in nanoscale trenches. By coupling surface diffusion limited transport, gradient strain, and competitive adsorption dynamics, the model predicts optimal conditions for bottom-up filling with maximal Ge content. For trenches with widths of approximately 60 nm, the optimized process achieved a maximum Ge content of 57.93% and demonstrated 100% selectivity against silicon nitride (SiN) and silicon dioxide (SiO). Cross sectional TEM and EDS analyses reveal a graded Ge profile that minimizes interfacial defects and strain energy. Our results show that the established process physics correlation will significantly facilitate the development of GAA devices with 5nm CMOS technology nodes and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spatially and Temporally Resolved Mapping of Contact Electrification on Stand-Alone Ultrathin Glass Materials via Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact electrification (CE) remains a critical challenge in advanced material technologies where uncontrolled surface charging can compromise manufacturability, reliability, and performance in practical applications. Ultrathin glass with micrometer-scale thickness is a state-of-the-art specialty oxide material for flexible touchscreens in next-generation electronic devices. Here, we visualize and quantify CE-induced surface charges on ultrathin glass using sideband-mode Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Nanoscale atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes are used to scan and induce triboelectric charges on stand-alone glass surfaces under ultra-pure N$_2$ conditions. Time-dependent measurements reveal that surface charges on a 30~$\mu$m-thick glass sample decay from 4.47~V to 0.37~V over 240~minutes. Furthermore, electrostatic charges are found to exhibit capacitor-like discharging behavior primarily through the bulk material, yielding a long relaxation time constant of approximately 41~minutes. This behavior differs from the lateral surface discharging observed in thermally grown SiO$2$ thin films reported previously. A self-capacitance analytical model is developed to estimate the corresponding surface charge density ($\sigma$), yielding comparable values of 136.26~$\pm$~16.25~$\mu$C/m$^2$ at 30~$\mu$m and 131.44~$\pm$~28.41~$\mu$C/m$^2$ at 100~$\mu$m. Additionally, external bias applied to AFM tips can be used to enhance, suppress, or invert the intrinsic CE response of glass materials.</description>

      <title>Infrared photonics for healthcare: A roadmap for proactive and predictive health management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of infrared (IR) photonics is currently undergoing remarkable progress, moving rapidly towards practical sensing applications demanded by medical therapy and diagnostics (theranostics). The Developments can be divided into three main categories: (i) novel devices and measurement concepts including advanced updates of classical approaches that push medical sensing into the spotlight; (ii) new demonstrations of photonic integrated circuit (PIC-)based IR devices enabling highly miniaturized sensors for point-of-care application as well as medical and wellness wearables; and (iii) technologically-mature IR demonstrators that enable first medical sensing and treatment applications. This roadmap paper provides a consolidated overview of this highly dynamic and interdisciplinary research field with a focus on the major roadblocks that limit the widespread adoption of IR photonics in large-scale medical diagnostics. Special attention is given to the ambivalence between the molecular-level spectroscopic interpretation and a broader health-state assessment, highlighting the need for a common framework. Additionally, the paper discusses the critical importance of unified measurement standards, calibration protocols, and medical certification processes to ensure the validity of experimental results, reproducibility, and clinical trust, particularly when novel experimental techniques and AI algorithms are involved. Perspectives from major past and current contributors to application-oriented IR photonics will be provided.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Fish Catch Using Sentinel-2, 3 and XGBoost-Kernel-Based Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oceanographic factors, such as sea surface temperature and upper-ocean dynamics, have a significant impact on fish distribution. Maintaining fisheries that contribute to global food security requires quantifying these connections. This study uses multispectral images from Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI to estimate fish catch using an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-kernelized Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) technique. According to model evaluation, the XGBoost-KRR framework achieves the strongest correlation and the lowest prediction error across both sensors, suggesting improved capacity to capture nonlinear ocean-fish connections. While Sentinel-2 MSI resolves finer-scale spatial variability, emphasizing localized ecological interactions, Sentinel-3 OLCI displays smoother spectral responses associated with poorer spatial resolution. By supporting sustainable ecosystem management and strengthening satellite-based fisheries assessment, the proposed approach advances SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 14 (Life Below Water).</description>

      <title>Germanium Thermophotovoltaic Devices Achieving 7.3% Efficiency Under High-Temperature Emission by Empirical Calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first empirical efficiency measurement of germanium-based thermophotovoltaic devices under high-temperature, high-irradiance conditions using a high view-factor calorimetric setup. Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated on p-type, highly doped (10^17 cm-3) Ge substrates, differing only in rear contact configuration. A standard device with a gold rear contact achieves a peak efficiency of 7.3 % and a power density of 1.77 W/cm2 at an emitter temperature of 1480 C, while a PERC-type device reaches 6.3 % efficiency and 1.22 W/cm2 at 1426 C. The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C. These results show that earlier projections remain valid but idealized and underscore the importance of emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization. Finally, we present the first direct comparison of Ge and InGaAs TPV devices under identical conditions, demonstrating the superior performance of InGaAs while confirming the cost-driven competitiveness of Ge.</description>

      <title>Perfect all-angle asymmetric transmission via normal susceptibilities: exact spatial derivative by local meta-atoms and nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic methodology for realizing accurate asymmetric all-angle transmission in nonlocal metasurfaces. As a representative example, we derive closed-form susceptibility conditions for exact first-order spatial differentiation of unity numerical aperture, clarifying the role of each underlying balance. We provide rigorous and detailed designs of physically meaningful structures that directly feature such susceptibilities: a conceptual local meta-atom and a realistic nonlocal multilayered printed circuit board (PCB). Importantly, the latter leverages an intricate system of nearfield coupling beyond standard homogenization. Validated in simulations, our results provide a general and modular route to high-resolution asymmetric nonlocal metasurfaces for optical analog processing.</description>

      <title>Two-photon-excited fluorescence spectroscopy of Rb atoms in a magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) measurements of the $5\mathrm{S}_{1/2} \rightarrow 5\mathrm{D}_{1/2}$ transition of $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We observe TPEF at excitation powers as low as 1 $\mu$W or fluxes as low as $4.30 \pm 0.22 \times 10^{18}\ \text{photons}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ ($^{85}$Rb) and $5.17 \pm 0.26 \times 10^{18}\ \text{photons}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ ($^{87}$Rb). Our results show that Rb, with additional benefits due to its ability to be optically cooled to the point where Doppler-broadening is negligible, is a promising platform for observing sensitive two-photon spectral signatures at low photon fluxes.</description>

      <title>Miniaturised multi-plane light converters via laser-written geometric phase holograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) are an emerging 3D beam shaping technology capable of deterministically mapping a basis of input spatial light modes to a new basis of output modes. The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology.</description>

      <title>Scalable Preconditioners for the Pseudo-4D DFN Lithium-ion Battery Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudo-4D Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model enables predictive simulation of lithium-ion batteries with three-dimensional electrode architectures and particle-scale diffusion, extending the standard pseudo-2D (P2D) formulation to fully resolve cell geometry. This leads to large, nonlinear systems with strong coupling across multiple physical scales, posing significant challenges for scalable numerical solution. We introduce block-structured preconditioning strategies that exploit the mathematical properties of the coupled system, employing multigrid techniques for electrode-level operators and localized solvers for particle-scale diffusion. Comprehensive scalability studies are performed across a range of geometries, including homogeneous and heterogeneous cubic cells, flattened jelly-roll configurations, and triply periodic minimal surface electrodes, to assess solver robustness and parallel scalability. The proposed methods consistently deliver efficient convergence and enable the solution of battery models with hundreds of millions of degrees of freedom on large-scale parallel hardware.</description>

      <title>Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.</description>

      <title>Broadband terahertz comb with sub-Hz comb linewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency combs are increasingly essential for spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum science. However, generating a dense array of evenly spaced ultra-narrow THz comb lines is challenging. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz comb generation using a photoconductive antenna that transfers a noise-suppressed near-infrared electro-optical (EO) comb into the THz domain. Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing. Crucially, the inherent frequency agility of the EO comb enables rapid and wide-range tuning of the THz comb line spacing. These attributes position our THz comb as a versatile tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precision THz metrology.</description>

      <title>Complete electronic phase diagram and enhanced superconductivity in fluorine-doped PrFeAsO1-xFx</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing a complete electronic phase diagram for REFeAsO (RE = rare earth, RE1111) ironbased superconductors has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we report a systematic investigation of PrFeAsO1-xFx over the full nominal fluorine-doping range 0 to 1 and construct the first comprehensive electronic phase diagram for this system. The evolution from the nonsuperconducting parent compound to the fluorine-rich limit reveals a broad dome shaped superconducting region. Structural refinement demonstrates a systematic lattice contraction with increasing fluorine content (x), corroborated by Raman spectroscopy through softening of the Pr(A1g) phonon mode and hardening of the Fe(B1g) mode, confirming effective fluorine incorporation at the oxygen sites. The maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) reaches up to 52.3 K, approximately 5 K higher than previous reports for Pr1111. Magnetotransport measurements yield large upper critical fields Hc2(0) exceeding 100 T, while analysis of resistive transition broadening reveals thermally activated flux flow with a crossover from single-vortex to collective pinning regimes. Specific-heat measurements exhibit a reduced jump deltaC/{\gamma}Tc &lt; 1.43, reflecting strong superconducting fluctuations and multiband pairing. These results establish clear structure property correlations and provide a unified description of superconductivity across the entire doping range of the Pr1111 system.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>

      <title>Influence of Elastic Oscillations on Nucleation in Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to establishing the mechanisms of elastic oscillation influence on nucleation processes in metal melts. The method of physical modeling with low-temperature metallic alloys (Wood and Rose) and transparent organic media (salol, camphene, diphenylamine) was used. It was established that vibration and ultrasound significantly reduce the supercooling required to initiate crystallization. The effectiveness of the influence significantly increases for samples with solid substrates. The hypotheses about the influence through changes in melt viscosity and the exclusive role of cavitation were experimentally refuted. The transition from pre-cavitation to cavitation ultrasound regime is not accompanied by qualitative changes in the influence on nucleation. The mechanism of elastic oscillation influence is substantiated, which consists in mechanical impact on adsorbed crystal nuclei on the surfaces of solid substrates. Elastic oscillations increase the nucleation rate by creating growth steps (dislocations) on the surfaces of adsorbed nuclei as a result of mechanical friction of solid substrates and cavitation erosion. The results have fundamental significance for understanding the physical nature of metal crystallization and practical application for developing technologies for controlling structure formation.</description>

      <title>Amplified up-conversion of electromagnetic waves using time-varying metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying metamaterials and photonic time crystals offer a powerful route to wave amplification through temporal modulation of material parameters. Here, we experimentally demonstrate amplified up-conversion of free-space electromagnetic waves in the microwave regime, with conversion efficiency exceeding the limits imposed by the Manley-Rowe relations as a result of a cascaded amplification process. Using a time-varying metasurface composed of an array of varactor-loaded coupled split-ring resonators, we investigate parametric amplification, frequency up-conversion and wave generation. Direct measurements in both non-degenerate and degenerate regimes show that the Manley-Rowe limits can be surpassed near integer multiples of the incident wave frequency when the pump frequency is approximately twice that of the incident wave. These results establish time-varying metasurfaces as an efficient platform for amplification, generation, and frequency conversion of electromagnetic waves in the microwave and terahertz bands, with potential extension to optical frequencies via ultrafast modulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Optically-Detected Spin-Acoustic Resonance in Solid-State Molecular Thin-film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of spin-acoustic resonance in pentacene thin films integrated on a high-quality-factor (high-Q) surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator on a lithium niobate substrate. Heterogeneous optically detected spin-acoustic resonance (HODSAR) is an optically detected spin-resonance measurement in which the resonant drive is delivered mechanically by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation. These results establish spin-acoustic resonance in a heterogeneously integrated molecular thin-film platform and provide a quantitative basis for benchmarking mechanically mediated spin control.</description>

      <title>A melting mode of frozen sessile droplets with unmelted ice layer deposited at the bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water-repellent properties of superhydrophobic surfaces make them promising for anti-icing and deicing applications. Through experimental visualization of frozen sessile droplets undergoing melting on superhydrophobic surfaces, we identify a melting mode with the unmelted ice layer deposited at the bottom of the melting droplet, even though the density of ice is lower than that of water. In the deposited mode of the melting process, the time required for the frozen droplet to melt completely is much shorter than that in the floating mode. Force analysis shows that the melted fluid flows along the gas-liquid interface toward the top of the melting droplet, thereby exerting force and then suppressing the upward movement of the unmelted ice layer. Moreover, the flow within the liquid film formed between the unmelted ice layer and the heating wall is dominated by the viscous force, which has a lubrication effect and maintains the deposition of the unmelted ice layer. High heating temperature, large contact angle, and low particle concentration are helpful for the occurrence of the deposited mode.</description>

      <title>Spin-active chlorine-related centers in 4H-SiC with telecom-band emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic resonance investigation of a defect in chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC is presented. This Cl-related center emits light at telecom wavelengths with zero-phonon lines in the range 1350-1540 nm. Its four configurations exhibit stable PL spectra characterized by narrow zero-phonon lines. For the two configurations that emit light at the C-band, a Debye-Waller factor in the range 22-25% is estimated. Optically detected magnetic resonance confirms that the Cl-related center is spin active and stable at room temperature with the zero-field splitting in the range of 1.0-1.4 GHz. The combined optical and spin properties suggest this center to be a highly promising candidate for scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Denoise Stepwise Signals by Diffusion Model Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stepwise signals are ubiquitous in single-molecule detections, where abrupt changes in signal levels typically correspond to molecular conformational changes or state transitions. However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new experimental setup combining X-Ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) in the hard x-ray regime and a high-pressure sample environment is developed to monitor the pressure dependence of the internal motion of complex systems down to the atomic scale in the multi-gigapascal range, from room temperature to 600K. The high flux of coherent high energy x-rays at 4th generation synchrotron source solves the problems caused by the absorption of the Diamond Anvil Cells used to generate the high pressure, enabling the measurement of the intermediate scattering function over 6 orders of magnitude in time, from $10^{-3}$ s to $10^{3}$s. The constraints posed by the high-pressure generation such as the preservation of X-ray coherence, as well as the sample, pressure and temperature stability, are discussed, and the feasibility of high-pressure XPCS is demonstrated through results obtained on metallic glasses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene is a promising platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. Efficient spin injection creates a significant spin accumulation of 20 meV and generates a spin diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect is expected to arise from nonlinear spin-charge interactions in the folded-bilayer graphene channel. These observed large spin signals and spin-diode effects in graphene systems offer a promising platform for developing active two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a chain of nonlinear modal interactions in softly clamped nanostring resonators. The process involves the sequential coupling of five mechanical modes, during frequency sweeps, yielding a broad nonlinear response with nearly constant amplitude. We demonstrate that soft clamping enables this cascaded energy transfer and amplifies the effective geometric nonlinearity of the driven mode by an order of magnitude. Analytical and finite element-based reduced-order models capture the key features of the coupling cascade and clarify its underlying mechanism. The phenomenon is generic in nonlinear vibrational systems and can be tailored through soft-clamping design strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal smoothing parameter in Eilers-Whittaker smoother</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eilers-Whittaker method for data smoothing effectiveness depends on the choice of the regularisation parameter, and automatic selection is a necessity for large datasets. Common methods, such as leave-one-out cross-validation, can perform poorly when serially correlated noise is present. We propose a novel procedure for selecting the control parameter based on the spectral entropy of the residuals. We define an S-curve from the Euclidean distance between points in a plot of the spectral entropy of the residuals versus that of the smoothed signal. The regularisation parameter corresponding to the absolute maximum of this S-curve is chosen as the optimal parameter. Using simulated data, we benchmarked our method against cross-validation and the V-curve. Validation was also performed on diverse experimental data. This robust and straightforward procedure can be a valuable addition to the available selection methods for the Eilers smoother.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity to Blackbody Radiation in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity long-wave infrared (LWIR) detection is crucial for observing weak thermal radiation. Recently, the Poisson bolometer is proposed as a fundamentally new platform for uncooled infrared detection. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source. In this work, uncooled infrared detection is advanced toward cryogenic-level sensitivity through the integration of spintronic materials and plasmonic materials. Specifically, a plasmonic absorber optimized for broadband LWIR absorption is experimentally integrated with a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber exhibits an absorptance exceeding 60\% across the LWIR spectrum, matching the peak of room-temperature blackbody radiation. The device achieves a noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance comparable to the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date. This work opens up pathways to high-sensitivity LWIR detection and imaging applications, including remote sensing, high-speed imaging, and industrial monitoring, while eliminating bulky and expensive cooling requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>
