      <title>Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\approx 0.05 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\approx 450 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to $\approx 1000 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.</description>

      <title>Molecular Distributions and Abundances in the Binary-Shaped Outflow of V Hya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries are known to play a key role in the mass loss and dynamical environments of evolved stars. Stellar and sub-stellar companion interactions produce complex wind morphologies including rotating/expanding disks, bipolar outflows, and spiral wind patterns; however, the connection between these many structures and the gas phase chemistry they harbor is not well-constrained. To expand the sample of chemical inventories in interacting systems, we present a detailed spectroscopic case study of the binary C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star V Hya. Using spatially resolved ALMA observations at Bands 3, 6 and 7, we characterize the rotational emission lines and distributions of molecules in its surrounding disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE). We detect emission from over 15 molecules and isotopologues toward this source, and present resolved maps for the brightest tracers of carbonaceous chemistry (e.g. CCH, C4H, HC5N, HNC, CH3CN). Employing LTE and non-LTE models of emission from the DUDE, we estimate the abundance distributions for optically thin species, and compare them with prototypical carbon-rich AGB envelopes. We find that the average abundances of detected species are within a factor of ${\sim}5$ from sources with similar mass-loss rates; however, the distribution of daughter species in V Hya is much more compact, with carbon chain species (CCH, C4H, HC3N) appearing with abundances $&gt;$10$^{-7}$ even in the innermost sampled regions (200 au) of the disk.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through improved particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>

      <title>Detection asymmetry in solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are detected in interplanetary space in association with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun. The magnetic connection between the observing spacecraft and the solar active region (AR) source of the event is a key parameter in determining whether SEPs are observed and the properties of the particle event. Aims. We investigate whether an east-west asymmetry in the detection of SEP events is present in observations and discuss its possible link to corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun. Methods. We used a published dataset of 239 CMEs recorded between 2006 and 2017 and having source regions both on the front side and far side of the Sun as seen from Earth. We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP intensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \Delta \phi, the separation in longitude between the source active region and the magnetic footpoint of the observing spacecraft based on the nominal Parker spiral. We focused on protons of energy &gt;10 MeV measured by the STEREO A, STEREO B and GOES spacecraft at 1 au. We also considered the occurrence of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31 and 0.47 au. Results. We find an east-west asymmetry in the detection of &gt;10 MeV proton events and of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source AR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected (-180 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; -40) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to observers with +40 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; +180. The asymmetry may be a signature of corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun, given that for events with \Delta \phi &lt; 0 corotation sweeps the particle-filled flux tubes towards the observing spacecraft, while for \Delta \phi &gt; 0 it takes them away from it.</description>

      <title>The salty emission of the intermediate-mass AGB star OH 30.1 -0.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse continuum and molecular emission, observed with ALMA, from the dust-enshrouded intermediate-mass AGB star OH 30.1 -0.7. We find a secondary peak in the continuum maps, "feature B", separated by 4.6" from the AGB star, which corresponds to a projected separation of $1.8 \times 10^4$ au, placing a lower limit on the physical separation. This feature is most likely composed of cold dust and is likely to be ejecta associated with the AGB star, though we cannot rule out that it is a background object. The molecular emission we detect includes lines of CO, SiS, CS, SO$_2$, NS, NaCl, and KCl. We find that the NS emission is off centre and arranged along an axis perpendicular to the direction of feature B, indicative of a UV-emitting binary companion (e.g. a G-type main sequence star or hotter), perhaps on an eccentric orbit, contributing to its formation. However, the NaCl and KCl emission constrain the nature of that companion to not be hotter than a late B-type main sequence star. We find relatively warm emission arising from the inner wind and detect several vibrationally excited lines of SiS (3 = 1), NaCl (up to 3 = 4) and KCl (up to 3 = 2), and emission from low energy levels in the mid to outer envelope, as traced by SO$_2$. The CO emission is abruptly truncated around 3.5" or 14,000 au from the continuum peak, suggesting that mass loss at a high rate may have commenced as little as 2800 years ago.</description>

      <title>Viscous Heating and Instabilities in the Partially Ionized Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In weak magnetic fields ($\lesssim 50 \,\mbox{G}$), parallel and perpendicular viscosities, mainly from neutrals, may exceed magnetic diffusivities (Ohm, Hall, ambipolar) in the middle and upper chromosphere. Ion-driven gyroviscosity may dominate in the upper chromosphere and transition region. In strong fields ($\gtrsim 100\, \mbox{G}$), viscosities primarily exceed diffusivities in the upper chromosphere and transition region. Parallel and perpendicular viscosities, being similar in magnitude, dampen waves and potentially compete with ambipolar diffusion in plasma heating, potentially inhibiting Hall and ambipolar instabilities when equal. The perpendicular viscosity tensor has two components, $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$, which differ slightly and show weak dependence on ion magnetization. Their differences, combined with shear, may destabilize waves, though magnetic diffusion introduces a cutoff for this instability. In configurations with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ having vertical ($b_z=B_z/|\bf{B}|$) and azimuthal ($b_y=B_y/|\bf{B}|$) components, and a wavevector $\bf{k}$ with radial ($\kx=k_x/|\bf{k}|$) and vertical ($\kz=k_z/|\bf{k}|$) components, parallel viscosity and Hall diffusion can generate the viscous-Hall instability. Gyroviscosity further destabilizes waves in the upper regions. These findings indicate that the solar atmosphere may experience various viscous instabilities, revealing complex interactions between viscosity, magnetic fields, and plasma dynamics across different atmospheric regions.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the solar coronal magnetic field based on coronal seismology with propagating Alfvenic waves: forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have demonstrated the capability of mapping the solar coronal magnetic field using the technique of coronal seismology based on the ubiquitous propagating Alfvenic/kink waves through imaging spectroscopy. We established a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a gravitationally stratified open magnetic flux tube, exciting kink waves propagating upwards along the tube. Forward modeling was performed to synthesize the Fe XIII 1074.7 and 1079.8 nm spectral line profiles, which were then used to determine the wave phase speed, plasma density, and magnetic field with seismology method. A comparison between the seismologically inferred results and the corresponding input values verifies the reliability of the seismology method. In addition, we also identified some factors that could lead to errors during magnetic field measurements. Our results may serve as a valuable reference for current and future coronal magnetic field measurements based on observations of propagating kink waves.</description>

      <title>A Search for Asymmetric Kinematic Components in Circumstellar Envelopes Using OH Main Line Masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars bf, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>Wave topology of stellar inertial oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial waves in convective regions of stars exhibit topological properties linked to a Chern number of 1. The first of these is a unique, unidirectional, prograde oscillation mode within the cavity, which propagates at arbitrarily low frequencies for moderate azimuthal wavenumbers. The second one are phase singularities around which the phase winds in Fourier space, with winding numbers of $\pm 1$ depending on the hemisphere. Phase winding is a collective effect over waves propagating in all directions that is strongly robust to noise. This suggests a topology-based method for wave detection in noisy observational data.</description>

      <title>High-Time-Cadence Spectroscopy and Photometry of Stellar Flares on M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with Seimei Telescope and TESS. I. Discovery of Rapid and Short-Duration Prominence Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-dwarfs show frequent flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may significantly impact close-in habitable planets. M-dwarf flares sometimes show red/blue asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ line profile, suggesting prominence eruptions as an early stage of CMEs. However, their high-time-cadence observations are limited. We conducted spectroscopic monitoring observations of the active M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with $\sim$1 minute time cadence using the Seimei telescope, simultaneously with the optical photometric observations by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We detected 27 H$\alpha$ flares with H$\alpha$ energies ranging from 1.7 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ to 3.8 $\times$ 10$^{32}$ erg and durations from 8 to 319 minutes. Among them, we identified 3 blue asymmetry and 5 red asymmetry events based on criteria using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The maximum velocity of the blue- and red-shifted components ranges from 250 to 450 km s$^{-1}$ and 190 to 400 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The duration and time evolution show variety, and in particular, we discovered rapid, short-duration blue/red asymmetry events with the duration of 6--8 minutes. Among the 8 blue/red asymmetry events, two blue and one red asymmetry events are interpreted as prominence eruptions because of their fast velocity and time evolution. Based on this interpretation, the lower limit of occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions can be estimated to be $\sim$1.1 events per day. Our discovery of short-duration events suggests that previous studies with low time cadence may have missed these events, potentially leading to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions/CMEs.</description>

      <title>Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently Skoutnev &amp; Beloborodov (2024) revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a ``toggle switch" in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be responsible for angular momentum transport. We implement such a ``toggle switch" in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in compositionally stratified regions, undermining the Tayler-Spruit dynamo as an explanation of the core-envelope coupling. In higher mass stars, the TI is active throughout the radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Estimating Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and [{\alpha}/Fe] for LAMOST O-M type Stars Using a Spectral Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we developed a spectral emulator based on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory Stellar Library (MaStar) and a grouping optimization strategy to estimate effective temperature (T_eff), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the abundance of alpha elements with respect to iron ([alpha/Fe]) for O-M-type stars within the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution spectra. The primary aim is to use a rapid spectral-fitting method, specifically the spectral emulator with the grouping optimization strategy, to create a comprehensive catalog for stars of all types within LAMOST, addressing the shortcomings in parameter estimations for both cold and hot stars present in the official LAMOST AFGKM-type catalog. This effort is part of our series of studies dedicated to establishing an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effectively applicable to parameter prediction for LAMOST, with the single-machine processing time within $70$ hr. We observed that the internal error dispersions for T_eff, log g, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] across different spectral types lie within the ranges of $15-594$ K, $0.03-0.27$ dex, $0.02-0.10$ dex, and $0.01-0.04$ dex, respectively, indicating a good consistency. A comparative analysis with external data highlighted deficiencies in the official LAMOST catalog and issues with MaStar parameters, as well as potential limitations of our method in processing spectra with strong emission lines and bad pixels. The derived atmospheric parameters as a part of this work are available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101402/ .</description>

      <title>Identifying Spicules in Mg II: Statistics and Comparisons with H{\alpha}</title>

Abstract: The Sun's chromosphere is a critical region to understand when considering energy and mass deposition into the transition region and corona, but many of the smaller, faster events which transport a portion of this mass and energy are still difficult to observe, identify and model. Solar Spicules are small, spike-like events in the solar chromosphere that have the potential to transfer energy and mass to the transition region, but whose energetic origins are still being researched. Chromospheric spicule activity on-disk can be identified by observing temporary excursions in the red and blue wings of chromospheric emission lines. Researchers have demonstrated this in Hydrogen~Alpha (H{\alpha}, 6563 {\AA}), Ca II (8542 {\AA}, k 3934 {\AA}), Mg II (h 2803 {\AA}, k 2796 {\AA}), and Si IV (1394 {\AA}, 1405 {\AA}) spectral observations, with the vast majority of identification efforts focused on lower chromospheric observations of H$\alpha$ and Ca II. Because any spicules which deposit mass and energy into the transition region must necessarily pass through the upper chromosphere, observations from this region such as Mg II or Hydrogen Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$ 1216 {\AA}) in enough quantity to perform proper statistics will be critical to fully characterizing spicules' impact on mass and energy transfer in the Sun. This research proposes a definition with numerical limits for how spicules appear in Mg II wavelengths, tunes an algorithm for automatically detecting spicules in Mg II spectral observations, and uses K Means Clustering to identify and display the full range of spicule spectrum shapes. This work will help allow statistical studies on spicules in the upper chromosphere to be as thorough as those of the lower chromosphere, allowing researchers to better understand the physical nature of spicules and their role in energy transfer and deposition in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Nested Morphological and Kinematic Structures of Outflows Revealed in SiO and CO Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) reveals complex nested morphological and kinematic features of molecular outflows through the CO (J = 2 - 1) and SiO (J = 5 - 4) emission. We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the ALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and G203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission exhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely-high-velocity (EHV) jets and shell-like low-velocity (LV) cavity walls and new features. More complex, nested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps, triangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions composed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs, are also evident. Such features find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified model of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on the PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic postshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed within the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission between the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These pseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jet-like knotty blobs, creating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is enhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jet-like excitation conditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures induced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle wind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>A massive white dwarf or low-mass neutron star discovered by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a close binary J0606+2132 (Gaia DR3 3423365496448406272) with $P_{\rm obs}=2.77$ days containing a possible massive white dwarf or a neutron star using the LAMOST spectroscopic data. By a joint fitting of the radial velocity from LAMOST and the light curve from TESS, we derived a circular Keplerian orbit with an inclination of $i=$81.31$^{\circ}$$^{+6.26^{\circ}}_{-7.85^{\circ}}$, which is consistent with that derived from $v{\rm sin}I$. Together with the mass of the visible star, we derived the mass of the invisible object to be 1.34$^{+0.35}_{-0.40} M_{\odot}$. Spectral disentangling with the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra shows no absorption feature from an additional component, suggesting the presence of a compact object. No X-ray or radio pulsed signal is detected from ROSAT and FAST archive observations. J0606+2132 could evolve into either a Type Ia supernova or a neutron star through accretion-induced collapse if it is a white dwarf, or into an intermediate-mass X-ray binary if it is a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Preparing for the Early eVolution Explorer: Characterizing the photochemical inputs and transit detection efficiencies of young planets using multiwavelength flare observations by TESS and Swift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraviolet flare emission can drive photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres and even serve as the primary source of uncertainty in atmospheric retrievals. Additionally, flare energy budgets are not well-understood due to a paucity of simultaneous observations. We present new near-UV (NUV) and optical observations of flares from three M dwarfs obtained at 20 s cadence with Swift and TESS, along with a re-analysis of flares from two M dwarfs in order to explore the energy budget and timing of flares at NUV--optical wavelengths. We find a 9000 K blackbody underestimates the NUV flux by $\geq$2$\times$ for 54$\pm$14% of flares and 14.8$\times$ for one flare. We report time lags between the bands of 0.5--6.6 min and develop a method to predict the qualitative flare shape and time lag to 36$\pm$30% accuracy. The scatter present in optical-NUV relations is reduced by a factor of 2.0$\pm$0.6 when comparing the total NUV energy with the TESS energy during the FWHM duration due to the exclusion of the $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx$5000 K tail. We show the NUV light curve can be used to remove flares from the optical light curve and consistently detect planets with 20% smaller transits than is possible without flare detrending. Finally, we demonstrate a 10$\times$ increase in the literature number of multi-wavelength flares with the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE), an astrophysics Small Explorer concept to observe young clusters with simultaneous NUV and optical bands in order to detect young planets, assess their photochemical radiation environments, and observe accretion.</description>

      <title>Stellar Obliquity Excitation via Disk Dispersal-Driven Resonances in Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system's formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the $\sim 50\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at $\sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.</description>

      <title>Tracing back a second-generation star stripped from Terzan 5 by the Galactic bar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic bulge hosts the Milky Way's oldest stars, possibly coming from disrupted globular clusters (GCs) or the bulge's primordial building blocks, making these stars witnesses to the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. The Galactic bar currently dominates the bulge's region, altering the orbits of objects formed before its formation and complicating the trace of the field stars' original clusters. Here, we present the discovery of a fossil record of this evolution, SOS1 -- a star trapped in the bar, exhibiting significant enhancements in nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, typical of second-generation GC stars. SOS1 also shows an s-process Ce enhancement, suggesting an old age and early enrichment by fast-rotating massive stars in the Galaxy's earliest phases. With the purpose of finding the SOS1's parent GC, we derive its precise chemodynamical properties by combining high-precision proper motions from Gaia with APOGEE detailed chemical abundances. Our analysis suggests that SOS1 was possibly stripped from the GC Terzan 5 by the Galactic bar's gravitational influence approximately 350 Myr ago. We also found chemical similarities suggesting that SOS1 belonged to the most metal-poor, ancient, and peripheral stellar population of Terzan 5. These results not only support the hypothesis that Terzan 5 is a remnant of a primordial building block of the Galactic bulge, but also suggest this cluster continues losing stars to the bar. Our method highlights how powerful the use of chemodynamical properties in the Gaia era is for tracing the Galaxy's evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: Two Super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs -- Signatures of Instability or Accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of TOI-6303b and TOI-6330b, two massive transiting super-Jupiters orbiting a M0 and a M2 star respectively, as part of the Searching for GEMS survey. These were detected by TESS and then confirmed via ground-based photometry and radial velocity observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF). TOI-6303b has a mass of 7.84 +/- 0.31 MJ, a radius of 1.03 +/- 0.06 RJ , and an orbital period of 9.485 days. TOI-6330b has a mass of 10.00 +/- 0.31 MJ , a radius of 0.97 +/- 0.03 RJ , and an orbital period of 6.850 days. We put these planets in context of super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs discovered from radial-velocity surveys, as well as recent discoveries from astrometry. These planets have masses that can be attributed to two dominant planet formation mechanisms - gravitational instability and core-accretion. Their masses necessitate massive protoplanetary disks that should either be gravitationally unstable, i.e. forming through gravitational instability, or be amongst some of the most massive protoplanetary disks to form objects through core-accretion. We also discuss the eccentricity distribution of these objects, as a potential indicator of their formation and evolutionary mechanisms.</description>

      <title>High-temperature $^{205}$Tl decay clarifies $^{205}$Pb dating in early Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radioactive nuclei with lifetimes on the order of millions of years can reveal the formation history of the Sun and active nucleosynthesis occurring at the time and place of its birth. Among such nuclei whose decay signatures are found in the oldest meteorites, $^{205}$Pb is a powerful example, as it is produced exclusively by slow neutron captures (the s process), with most being synthesized in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, making accurate abundance predictions for $^{205}$Pb has so far been impossible because the weak decay rates of $^{205}$Pb and $^{205}$Tl are very uncertain at stellar temperatures. To constrain these decay rates, we measured for the first time the bound-state $\beta^-$ decay of fully ionized $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$, an exotic decay mode that only occurs in highly charged ions. The measured half-life is 4.7 times longer than the previous theoretical estimate and our 10% experimental uncertainty has eliminated the main nuclear-physics limitation. With new, experimentally backed decay rates, we used AGB stellar models to calculate $^{205}$Pb yields. Propagating those yields with basic galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and comparing with the $^{205}$Pb/$^{204}$Pb ratio from meteorites, we determined the isolation time of solar material inside its parent molecular cloud. We find positive isolation times that are consistent with the other s-process short-lived radioactive nuclei found in the early Solar System. Our results reaffirm the site of the Sun's birth as a long-lived, giant molecular cloud and support the use of the $^{205}$Pb--$^{205}$Tl decay system as a chronometer in the early Solar System.</description>

      <title>Magnetometry: solving the fundamental ambiguity from line pair inversion</title>

Abstract: All magnetic field vector measurements lead to ambiguous results. We show that observations in two different lines belonging to the same multiplet but having different absorption coefficients so that they are formed at two different depths like Fe I 6302.5 A and 6301.5 A, enable the resolution of the azimuth ambiguity remaining from the Zeeman signal interpretation. What is measured by interpretation of the Zeeman effect is the magnetic field H, and not the divergence-free magnetic induction B. We analyze how the anisotropy of the photosphere, which is strongly stratified due to gravity and density at the star surface, affects divH and how the ambiguity resolution has to be performed in these conditions. As a consequence, two ambiguity-resolved field vector maps are obtained at two different but close altitudes, which enable the derivation of the current density full vector via curlH=J. This reveals the horizontal component of the current density, which is generally found markedly larger than the better known vertical one. We observe some systematical trends, of which we present examples in the paper, like circular currents wrapping spots clockwise about a positive polarity spot and anticlockwise about a negative polarity spot and strong horizontal current components crossing active region neutral lines. We finally remark that the Na I D1 and D2 lines form another such line pair. We propose them as an access to the low chromosphere where they are formed. However, a better spatial resolution for both observations and analysis would probably be necessary in such a medium.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Solar and stellar observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths offer a complementary perspective on our Sun and other stars, offering significant insights into both the thermal and magnetic composition of their chromospheres. Despite the fundamental progress in (sub-)millimeter observations of the Sun, some important aspects require diagnostic capabilities that are not offered by existing observatories. In particular, simultaneous observations of the radiation continuum across an extended frequency range would facilitate the mapping of different layers and thus ultimately the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere. Mapping large regions on the Sun or even the whole solar disk at a very high temporal cadence would be crucial for systematically detecting and following the temporal evolution of flares, while synoptic observations, i.e., daily maps, over periods of years would provide an unprecedented view of the solar activity cycle in this wavelength regime. As our Sun is a fundamental reference for studying the atmospheres of active main sequence stars, observing the Sun and other stars with the same instrument would unlock the enormous diagnostic potential for understanding stellar activity and its impact on exoplanets. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a single-dish telescope with 50\,m aperture proposed to be built in the Atacama desert in Chile, would be able to provide these observational capabilities. Equipped with a large number of detector elements for probing the radiation continuum across a wide frequency range, AtLAST would address a wide range of scientific topics including the thermal structure and heating of the solar chromosphere, flares and prominences, and the solar activity cycle. In this white paper, the key science cases and their technical requirements for AtLAST are discussed.</description>

The resulting extreme solar storm is believed to be the consequence of multiple interacting coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Notably, this AR exhibites an exceptionally rapid magnetic flux emergence. The eruptions we are focusing on all occurred along collisional polarity inversion lines (PILs) through ``collisional shearing'' during a three-day period of extraordinarily high flux emergence ($\sim$10$^{21}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$). Our key findings reveal how photospheric magnetic configurations in eruption sources influence solar superstorm formation and geomagnetic responses, and link exceptionally strong flux emergence to sequential homologous eruptions: (1) We identified the source regions of seven halo CMEs, distributed primarily along two distinct PILs, suggesting the presence of two groups of homologous CMEs. (2) The variations in magnetic flux emergence rates at the source regions correlate with CME intensities, potentially explaining the two contrasting cases of complex ejecta observed at Earth. (3) Calculations of magnetic field gradients around CME source regions show strong correlations with eruptions, providing crucial insights into solar eruption mechanisms and enhancing future prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Discovery of eclipses in the cataclysmic variable LAMOST J035913.61+405035.0</title>

Abstract: I conducted photometric observations of the cataclysmic variable LAMOST J035913.61+405035.0 and discovered previously unknown eclipses. During these observations, I recorded 14 eclipses over two groups of nights separated by 13 months. I accurately determined the orbital period of the system to be Porb=0.22834385+\-0.00000021 d. For the eclipses, I derived an ephemeris which is valid for a long time and suitable for studying changes in the orbital period. The out-of-eclipse magnitude of the star varied between 15.32(+\-0.02) and 17.25(+\-0.08) mag. As the brightness decreased, the eclipses became deeper and narrower. The average depth of eclipses was 1.35(+\-0.10) mag, and the average width at half-depth was 16.9(+\-0.7) min. I estimated the range of possible orbital inclinations to be between 72.8 degr and 76.0 degr, and the range of average absolute V-band magnitudes of the disc to be between 5.16(+\-0.15) and 5.44(+\-0.15) mag. Although based on the light curve from the ZTF survey, LAMOST J035913.61+405035.0 showed only small outbursts with amplitudes below 1.5 mag, it should be classified as a dwarf nova because the average disc brightness and mass transfer rate were below the limit of thermal instability. However, there have been no significant outbursts in the ZTF light curve over the past 1.6 yr. Instead, a gradual decrease in brightness lasting 120 d suggests that this object may occasionally become a nova-like variable of the VY Scl type.</description>

      <title>Stellar Expansion or Inflation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: II. Observations of an Eta Carinae Analog at $z=2.37$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at $z=2.37$. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found in any other clumps. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly$\beta$ emission, as well as Ly$\alpha$-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Spectra and images of Godzilla and two faint adjacent images, and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data, support the interpretation that Godzilla is an extremely magnified object due to the alignment with lensing caustics. We find that Godzilla is part of a previously identified clump, comprising $\sim10 - 25$ % of it, with magnifications in the range of $\approx600-25,000$ depending on the models and images in comparison. The unique O I source in Godzilla is well explained by a non-erupting LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. If Godzilla is confirmed to contain an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.</description>

      <title>Close Binary Fractions in accreted and in-situ Halo Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of binary stars in the Galactic halo provides crucial insights into the dynamical history and formation processes of the Milky Way. In this work, we aim to investigate the binary fraction in a sample of accreted and in-situ halo stars, focusing on short-period binaries. Utilising data from Gaia DR3, we analysed the radial velocity (RV) uncertainty $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ distribution of a sample of main-sequence stars. We used a novel Bayesian framework to model the dependence in $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ of single and binary systems allowing us to estimate binary fractions $F$ in a sample of bright ($G_{\mathrm{RVS}}$ &lt; 12) Gaia sources. We selected the samples of in-situ and accreted halo stars based on estimating the 6D phase space information and affiliating the stars to the different samples on an action-angle vs energy ($L_{\mathrm{z}}-E$) diagram. Our results indicate a higher, though not significant, binary fraction in accreted stars compared to the in-situ halo sample. We further explore binary fractions using cuts in $E$ and $L_z$ and find a higher binary fraction in both high-energy and prograde orbits that might be explained by differences in metallicity. By cross-matching our Gaia sample with APOGEE DR17 catalogue, we confirm the results of previous studies on higher binary fractions in metal-poor stars and find the fractions of accreted and in-situ halo stars consistent with this trend. Our finding provides new insights into binary stars' formation processes and dynamical evolution in the primordial Milky Way Galaxy and its accreted dwarf Galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave emission in Binary Neutron Star early post-merger within a dark environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an effective Lagrangian model inspired by Takami et al. 2015 we qualitatively study the early post-merger of a nearly symmetric binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger event with a non-vanishing ambient fraction of dark matter. For this we first mimic the dynamics of two oscillating Neutron Star (NS) masses in the gravitational potential well as they merge. We parametrize the dynamics and ejecta properties in the coalescence event allowing the formation of a surrounding debris disk that may be containing a non-vanishing dark matter fraction. In order to analyze the possible novel dark contribution, we start from a dark-matter free modellization as a benchmark. Using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques we approximately recover the gravitational waveforms, restricted to early post-merger time interval from existing simulations in the CoRe database. Later, we explore the impact of an additional dark viscous fluid under a prescribed velocity dependent force in the Lagrangian and obtain the resulting waveforms and some spectral features originating in the first few ms in the BNS post-merger. Finally we discuss our qualitative findings and its range of validity in light of the prospects of detectability in present or future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for modeling the temporal and spectral evolution of kilonova systematic uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and frequency-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and frequency-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.</description>

      <title>Deep Search for a scattered light dust halo around Vega with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a provisory scattered light detection of the Vega debris disk using deep Hubble Space Telescope coronagraphy (PID 16666). At only 7.7 parsecs, Vega is immensely important in debris disk studies both for its prominence and also because it allows the highest physical resolution among all debris systems relative to temperature zones around the star. We employ the STIS coronagraph's widest wedge position and classical Reference Differential Imaging to achieve among the lowest surface brightness sensitivities to date ($\sim 4\,\mu Jy/arcsec^{2}$) at wide separations using 32 orbits in Cycle 29. We detect a halo extending from the inner edge of our effective inner working angle at $10^{\prime\prime}.5$ out to the photon noise floor at $30^{\prime\prime}$ (80 - 230 au). The face-on orientation of the system and the lack of a perfectly color-matched PSF star have provided significant challenges to the reductions, particularly regarding artifacts from the imperfect color matching. However, we find that a halo of small dust grains provides the best explanation for the observed signal. Unlike Fomalhaut (a close twin to Vega in luminosity, distance, and age), there is no clear distinction in scattered light between the parent planetesimal belt observed with ALMA and the extended dust halo. These HST observations complement JWST GTO Cycle 1 observations of the system with NIRCam and MIRI.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fraction of the dense cores that form within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. To this end, here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of ``critical cores'' that are on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion constructed for individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While there exists a global linewidth--size relation for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations constructed around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse, but instead cores collapse at a wide range of densities determined by the local sonic scale, modulated by the local gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores found in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the average properties of a turbulent cloud. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.</description>
