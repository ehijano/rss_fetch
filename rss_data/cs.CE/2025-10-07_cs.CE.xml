      <title>Report of the 2025 Workshop on Next-Generation Ecosystems for Scientific Computing: Harnessing Community, Software, and AI for Cross-Disciplinary Team Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03413v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarizes insights from the 2025 Workshop on Next-Generation Ecosystems for Scientific Computing: Harnessing Community, Software, and AI for Cross-Disciplinary Team Science, which convened more than 40 experts from national laboratories, academia, industry, and community organizations to chart a path toward more powerful, sustainable, and collaborative scientific software ecosystems. To address urgent challenges at the intersection of high-performance computing (HPC), AI, and scientific software, participants envisioned agile, robust ecosystems built through socio-technical co-design--the intentional integration of social and technical components as interdependent parts of a unified strategy. This approach combines advances in AI, HPC, and software with new models for cross-disciplinary collaboration, training, and workforce development. Key recommendations include building modular, trustworthy AI-enabled scientific software systems; enabling scientific teams to integrate AI systems into their workflows while preserving human creativity, trust, and scientific rigor; and creating innovative training pipelines that keep pace with rapid technological change. Pilot projects were identified as near-term catalysts, with initial priorities focused on hybrid AI/HPC infrastructure, cross-disciplinary collaboration and pedagogy, responsible AI guidelines, and prototyping of public-private partnerships. This report presents a vision of next-generation ecosystems for scientific computing where AI, software, hardware, and human expertise are interwoven to drive discovery, expand access, strengthen the workforce, and accelerate scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Data-Efficient MultivariateTime Series Forecasting using Residual-Stacked Gaussian (RS-GLinear) Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the success of Transformer architectures in language modeling, particularly their ability to capture long-range dependencies, researchers have explored how these architectures can be adapted for time-series forecasting. Transformer-based models have been proposed to handle both short- and long-term dependencies when predicting future values from historical data. However, studies such as those by Zeng et al. (2022) and Rizvi et al. (2025) have reported mixed results in long-term forecasting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the Gaussian-based Linear architecture introduced by Rizvi et al. (2025) and present an enhanced version called the Residual Stacked Gaussian Linear (RSGL) model. We also investigate the broader applicability of the RSGL model in additional domains, including financial time series and epidemiological data. Experimental results show that the RSGL model achieves improved prediction accuracy and robustness compared to both the baseline Gaussian Linear and Transformer-based models.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om-Accelerated Primal LS-SVMs: Breaking the $O(an^3)$ Complexity Bottleneck for Scalable ODEs Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major problem of kernel-based methods (e.g., least squares support vector machines, LS-SVMs) for solving linear/nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is the prohibitive $O(an^3)$ ($a=1$ for linear ODEs and 27 for nonlinear ODEs) part of their computational complexity with increasing temporal discretization points $n$. We propose a novel Nystr\"om-accelerated LS-SVMs framework that breaks this bottleneck by reformulating ODEs as primal-space constraints. Specifically, we derive for the first time an explicit Nystr\"om-based mapping and its derivatives from one-dimensional temporal discretization points to a higher $m$-dimensional feature space ($1&lt; m\le n$), enabling the learning process to solve linear/nonlinear equation systems with $m$-dependent complexity. Numerical experiments on sixteen benchmark ODEs demonstrate: 1) $10-6000$ times faster computation than classical LS-SVMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), 2) comparable accuracy to LS-SVMs ($&lt;0.13\%$ relative MAE, RMSE, and $\left \| y-\hat{y} \right \| _{\infty } $difference) while maximum surpassing PINNs by 72\% in RMSE, and 3) scalability to $n=10^4$ time steps with $m=50$ features. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient kernel-based ODEs learning without significantly sacrificing the accuracy of the solution.</description>

      <title>A Complement to Neural Networks for Anisotropic Inelasticity at Finite Strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a complement to constitutive modeling that augments neural networks with material principles to capture anisotropy and inelasticity at finite strains. The key element is a dual potential that governs dissipation, consistently incorporates anisotropy, and-unlike conventional convex formulations-satisfies the dissipation inequality without requiring convexity.
  Our neural network architecture employs invariant-based input representations in terms of mixed elastic, inelastic and structural tensors. It adapts Input Convex Neural Networks, and introduces Input Monotonic Neural Networks to broaden the admissible potential class. To bypass exponential-map time integration in the finite strain regime and stabilize the training of inelastic materials, we employ recurrent Liquid Neural Networks.
  The approach is evaluated at both material point and structural scales. We benchmark against recurrent models without physical constraints and validate predictions of deformation and reaction forces for unseen boundary value problems. In all cases, the method delivers accurate and stable performance beyond the training regime. The neural network and finite element implementations are available as open-source and are accessible to the public via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17199965.</description>

      <title>Open-source FDTD solvers: The applicability of Elecode, gprMax and MEEP for simulations of lightning EM fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the open-source finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solvers gprMax, Elecode and MEEP are investigated for their suitability to compute lightning electromagnetic field propagation. Several simulations are performed to reproduce the results of typical field propagation scenarios that can be found in the literature. The results of the presented solvers are validated through comparison with reference field results corresponding to propagation over perfectly conducting and lossy ground. In most of the tested scenarios, all solvers reproduce the reference fields with satisfactory accuracy. However, close attention must be paid to the proper choice of the spatial discretization to avoid artificial numerical dispersion, and the application of the simulation cell boundaries, which can cause significant impairment of the results due to undesired reflections. Some cases of inaccurate FDTD results due to improper choices of parameters are demonstrated. Further, the features, the performance and limitations, and the advantages and drawbacks of the presented solvers are highlighted. For familiarization with the solvers' programmatical interfaces to initialize and run the simulations, the developed scripts are made available to the community in an openly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast Option Pricing PDE Solvers Powered by PIELM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers underpin modern quantitative finance, governing option pricing and risk evaluation. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving the forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. However they remain computationally expensive due to their iterative gradient descent based optimization and scale poorly with increasing model size. This paper introduces Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs) as fast alternative to PINNs for solving both forward and inverse problems in financial PDEs. PIELMs replace iterative optimization with a single least-squares solve, enabling deterministic and efficient training. We benchmark PIELM on the Black-Scholes and Heston-Hull-White models for forward pricing and demonstrate its capability in inverse model calibration to recover volatility and interest rate parameters from noisy data. From experiments we observe that PIELM achieve accuracy comparable to PINNs while being up to $30\times$ faster, highlighting their potential for real-time financial modeling.</description>

      <title>Deep vs. Shallow: Benchmarking Physics-Informed Neural Architectures on the Biharmonic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers are fundamental to engineering simulation. Classical mesh-based approaches (finite difference/volume/element) are fast and accurate on high-quality meshes but struggle with higher-order operators and complex, hard-to-mesh geometries. Recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants are mesh-free and flexible, yet compute-intensive and often less accurate. This paper systematically benchmarks RBF-PIELM, a rapid PINN variant-an extreme learning machine with radial-basis activations-for higher-order PDEs. RBF-PIELM replaces PINNs' time-consuming gradient descent with a single-shot least-squares solve. We test RBF-PIELM on the fourth-order biharmonic equation using two benchmarks: lid-driven cavity flow (streamfunction formulation) and a manufactured oscillatory solution. Our results show up to $(350\times)$ faster training than PINNs and over $(10\times)$ fewer parameters for comparable solution accuracy. Despite surpassing PINNs, RBF-PIELM still lags mature mesh-based solvers and its accuracy degrades on highly oscillatory solutions, highlighting remaining challenges for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Surrogates for Free Energy Computation of Complex Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover, Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of biochemistry and materials simulations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Temperature Modelling of Machine Tools by Neural Networks: A Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal errors in machine tools significantly impact machining precision and productivity. Traditional thermal error correction/compensation methods rely on measured temperature-deformation fields or on transfer functions. Most existing data-driven compensation strategies employ neural networks (NNs) to directly predict thermal errors or specific compensation values. While effective, these approaches are tightly bound to particular error types, spatial locations, or machine configurations, limiting their generality and adaptability. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm in which NNs are trained to predict high-fidelity temperature and heat flux fields within the machine tool. The proposed framework enables subsequent computation and correction of a wide range of error types using modular, swappable downstream components. The NN is trained using data obtained with the finite element method under varying initial conditions and incorporates a correlation-based selection strategy that identifies the most informative measurement points, minimising hardware requirements during inference. We further benchmark state-of-the-art time-series NN architectures, namely Recurrent NN, Gated Recurrent Unit, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer, and Temporal Convolutional Network, by training both specialised models, tailored for specific initial conditions, and general models, capable of extrapolating to unseen scenarios. The results show accurate and low-cost prediction of temperature and heat flux fields, laying the basis for enabling flexible and generalisable thermal error correction in machine tool environments.</description>

      <title>InstructPLM-mu: 1-Hour Fine-Tuning of ESM2 Beats ESM3 in Protein Mutation Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal protein language models deliver strong performance on mutation-effect prediction, but training such models from scratch demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework called InstructPLM-mu and try to answer a question: \textit{Can multimodal fine-tuning of a pretrained, sequence-only protein language model match the performance of models trained end-to-end? } Surprisingly, our experiments show that fine-tuning ESM2 with structural inputs can reach performance comparable to ESM3. To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Evolutionary Program Synthesis for Quasi-Monte Carlo Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-discrepancy point sets and digital sequences underpin quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-dimensional integration. We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N &gt;= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N &lt;= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters. Data and code are available at https://github.com/hockeyguy123/openevolve-star-discrepancy.git.</description>

      <title>CALM Before the STORM: Unlocking Native Reasoning for Optimization Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs -- In particular, we show that direct fine-tuning on traditional \textit{non-reflective} datasets leads to limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs' inherent reasoning abilities, we propose \textbf{CALM} (\textit{Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification}), a framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions modify fewer than 2.6\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop \textbf{STORM} (\textit{Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model}), a 4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of 68.9\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the performance of a 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of modern LRMs, offering a more effective and scalable path towards expert-level performance on challenging optimization modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>TCR-EML: Explainable Model Layers for TCR-pMHC Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is a central component of adaptive immunity, with implications for vaccine design, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune disease. While recent advances in machine learning have improved prediction of TCR-pMHC binding, the most effective approaches are black-box transformer models that cannot provide a rationale for predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods can provide insight with respect to the input but do not explicitly model biochemical mechanisms (e.g. known binding regions), as in TCR-pMHC binding. ``Explain-by-design'' models (i.e., with architectural components that can be examined directly after training) have been explored in other domains, but have not been used for TCR-pMHC binding. We propose explainable model layers (TCR-EML) that can be incorporated into protein-language model backbones for TCR-pMHC modeling. Our approach uses prototype layers for amino acid residue contacts drawn from known TCR-pMHC binding mechanisms, enabling high-quality explanations for predicted TCR-pMHC binding. Experiments of our proposed method on large-scale datasets demonstrate competitive predictive accuracy and generalization, and evaluation on the TCR-XAI benchmark demonstrates improved explainability compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz Scheme for Linear-Quadratic Programs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimize-then-discretize framework for solving linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCP) governed by time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our method employs a modified overlapping Schwarz decomposition based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, partitioning the temporal domain into overlapping intervals and independently solving Hamiltonian systems in continuous time. We demonstrate that the convergence is ensured by appropriately updating the boundary conditions of the individual Hamiltonian dynamics. The cornerstone of our analysis is to prove that the exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS) exhibited in discrete-time OCPs carries over to the continuous-time setting. Unlike the discretize-then-optimize approach, our method can flexibly incorporate different numerical integration methods for solving the resulting Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value subproblems, including adaptive-time integrators. A numerical experiment on a linear-quadratic OCP illustrates the practicality of our approach in broad scientific applications.</description>

      <title>ChartAgent: A Multimodal Agent for Visually Grounded Reasoning in Complex Chart Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations, cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask. This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07% absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries. Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using tool-augmented multimodal agents.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models for Short-Term Household Electricity Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate household electricity short-term load forecasting (STLF) is key to future and sustainable energy systems. While various studies have analyzed statistical, machine learning, or deep learning approaches for household electricity STLF, recently proposed time series foundation models such as Chronos, TimesFM or Time-MoE promise a new approach for household electricity STLF. These models are trained on a vast amount of time series data and are able to forecast time series without explicit task-specific training (zero-shot learning). In this study, we benchmark the forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models compared to Trained-from-Scratch (TFS) Transformer-based approaches. Our results suggest that foundation models perform comparably to TFS Transformer models, while certain time series foundation models outperform all TFS models when the input size increases. At the same time, they require less effort, as they need no domain-specific training and only limited contextual data for inference.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Loss Balancing in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fluid Flow Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising machine learning approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs face significant challenges in balancing multi-objective losses, as multiple competing loss terms such as physics residuals, boundary conditions, and initial conditions must be appropriately weighted. While various loss balancing schemes have been proposed, they have been implemented within neural network architectures with fixed activation functions, and their effectiveness has been assessed using simpler PDEs. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of loss balancing schemes depends not only on the balancing strategy itself, but also on the loss function design and the neural network's inherent function approximation capabilities, which are influenced by the choice of activation function. In this paper, we extend existing solutions by incorporating trainable activation functions within the neural network architecture and evaluate the proposed approach on complex fluid flow applications modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. Our evaluation across diverse Navier-Stokes problems demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves root mean square error (RMSE) improvements ranging from 7.4% to 95.2% across different scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of carefully designing the loss function and selecting activation functions for effective loss balancing.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Hit Moving Targets? Tracking Evolving Signals in Corporate Disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving targets -- managers' strategic shifting of key performance metrics when the original targets become difficult to achieve -- have been shown to predict subsequent stock underperformance. However, our work reveals that the method employed in that study exhibits two key limitations that hinder the accuracy -- noise in the extracted targets and loss of contextual information -- both of which stem primarily from the use of a named entity recognition (NER). To address these two limitations, we propose an LLM-based target extraction method with a newly defined metric that better captures semantic context. This approach preserves semantic context beyond simple entity recognition and yields consistently higher predictive power than the original approach. Overall, our approach enhances the granularity and accuracy of financial text-based performance prediction.</description>

      <title>SGRDN-Data learned sparsification of graph reaction-diffusion networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11943v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph sparsification is an area of interest in computer science and applied mathematics. Sparsification of a graph, in general, aims to reduce the number of edges in the network while preserving specific properties of the graph, like cuts and subgraph counts. Computing the sparsest cuts of a graph is known to be NP-hard, and sparsification routines exist for generating linear-sized sparsifiers in almost quadratic running time $O(n^{2 + \epsilon})$. Consequently, obtaining a sparsifier can be a computationally demanding task, and the complexity varies based on the level of sparsity required. We propose SGRDN to extend sparsification to complex reaction-diffusion systems. This approach seeks to sparsify the graph such that the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics are strictly preserved on the resulting structure. By selectively considering a subset of trajectories, we frame the network sparsification issue as a data assimilation problem within a Reduced Order Model (ROM) space, imposing constraints to conserve the eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix ($L = D - A$), the difference between the degree matrix ($D$) and the adjacency matrix ($A$) despite perturbations. We derive computationally efficient eigenvalue and eigenvector approximations for perturbed Laplacian matrices and integrate these as spectral preservation constraints in the optimization problem. To further validate the method's broad applicability, we conducted an additional experiment on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs), where SGRDN successfully achieved parameter sparsity.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Evo-PINN Frontiers and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast EAs as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.</description>

      <title>Thought Purity: A Defense Framework For Chain-of-Thought Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense framework that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Structure of Press Releases for Predicting Earnings Announcement Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from 2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.</description>
