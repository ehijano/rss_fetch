      <title>Complements of finite unions of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite unions of convex sets are a central object of study in discrete and computational geometry. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of complements of such unions -- i.e., sets of the form $S=\mathbb{R}^d \setminus (\cup_{i=1}^n K_i)$, where $K_i$ are convex sets. In the first part of the paper we study isolated points in $S$, whose number is related to the Betti numbers of $\cup_{i=1}^n K_i$ and to its non-convexity properties.
  We obtain upper bounds on the number of such points, which are sharp for $n=3$ and significantly improve previous bounds of Lawrence and Morris (2009) for all $n \ll \frac{2^d}{d}$. In the second part of the paper we study coverings of $S$ by well-behaved sets. We show that $S$ can be covered by at most $g(d,n)$ flats of different dimensions, in such a way that each $x \in S$ is covered by a flat whose dimension equals the `local dimension' of $S$ in the neighborhood of $x$. Furthermore, we determine the structure of a minimum cover that satisfies this property. Then, we study quantitative aspects of this minimum cover and obtain sharp upper bounds on its size in various settings.</description>

      <title>Weak saturation numbers of large complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is weakly $F$-saturated if $G$ contains no copy of $F$ and there exists an ordering of all edges in $E(K_n) \setminus E(G)$ such that, when added one at a time, each edge creates a new copy of $F$. The minimum size of a weakly $F$-saturated graph $G$ is called the weak saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(n, F)$. We obtain exact values and new bounds for $\mathrm{wsat}(n, K_{s,t})$ in the previously unaddressed range $s+t &lt; n &lt; 3t-3$, where $3\leq s\leq t$. To prove lower bounds, we introduce a new method that takes into account connectivity properties of subgraphs of a complement $G'$ to a weakly saturated graph $G$. We construct an auxiliary hypergraph and show that a linear combination of its parameters always increases in the process of the deletion of edges of $G'$. This gives a lower bound which is tight, up to an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Orbitmesy and promotion on self-dual posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of orbitmesy, which is related to homomesy, a central phenomenon in dynamical algebraic combinatorics. An orbit $O$ is said to be orbitmesic with respect to a statistic if the orbit's average statistic value is equal to the global average. We particularly focus on the action of promotion on increasing labelings of certain fence posets called zig-zag posets, and two statistics, the antipodal sum statistic and the total sum statistic. We classify all of the orbitmesic promotion orbits for the zig-zag poset with four elements. Along the way, we investigate how homomesy of one action can be used to find orbitmesic orbits for another action, for the same fixed statistic. We prove several general results which can be used to find infinite families of orbitmesic orbits for any self-dual poset.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic size of the Karp-Sipser Core in Configuration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic size of the Karp-Sipser core in the configuration model with arbitrary degree distributions. The Karp-Sipser core is the induced subgraph obtained by iteratively removing all leaves and their neighbors through the leaf-removal process, and finally discarding any isolated vertices \cite{BCC}. Our main result establishes the convergence of the Karp-Sipser core size to an explicit fixed-point equation under general degree assumptions.The approach is based on analyzing the corresponding local weak limit of the configuration model - a unimodular Galton-Watson tree and tracing the evolution process of all vertex states under leaf-removal dynamics by use of the working mechanism of an enhanced version of Warning Propagation along with Node Labeling Propagation.</description>

      <title>Curves in projective space and RSK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric Tevelev degrees of projective space enumerate general, pointed algebraic curves interpolating through the maximal possible number of points. Previous work expresses these invariants in terms of Schubert calculus. Extending ideas of Gillespie--Reimer-Berg, we use the RSK correspondence to give a positive interpretation of these counts in terms of the combinatorics of words.</description>

      <title>Various spectral aspects of NCCC-graphs of certain finite non-abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${G}$ be a finite non-abelian group. The non-commuting conjugacy class graph (abbreviated as NCCC-graph) of $G$ is a simple undirected graph whose vertex set is the set of conjugacy classes of non-central elements of $G$ and two vertices $x^G$ and $y^G$ are adjacent to each other if $x'$ and $y'$ does not commute for all $x'\in x^G$ and $y'\in y^G$, where $x^G$ is the conjugacy class of $x \in G$. In this paper, we compute the spectrum, Laplacian spectrum, signless Laplacian spectrum and corresponding energies of NCCC-graphs of certain families of finite non-abelian groups. We determine whether these graphs are integral, L-integral and Q-integral. Further, we compare energy, Laplacian energy and signless Laplacian energy; and determine whether these graphs are borderenergetic, L-borderenergetic, Q-borderenergetic, hyperenergetic, L-hyperenergetic or Q-hyperenergetic.</description>

      <title>Fractional domatic number and minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domatic number of a graph $G$ is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint dominating sets of $G$. We are interested in the LP-relaxation of this parameter, which is called the fractional domatic number of $G$. We study its extremal value in the class of graphs of minimum degree $d$. The fractional domatic number of a graph of minimum degree $d$ is always at most $d+1$, and at least $(1-o(1))\, d/\ln d$ as $d\to \infty$. This is asymptotically tight even within the class of split graphs. Our main result concerns the case $d=2$; we show that, excluding $8$ exceptional graphs, the fractional domatic number of every connected graph of minimum degree (at least) $2$ is at least $5/2$. We also show that this bound cannot be improved if only finitely many graphs are excluded, even when restricting to bipartite graphs of girth at least $6$. This proves in a stronger sense a conjecture by Gadouleau, Harms, Mertzios, and Zamaraev (2024). This also extends and generalises results from McCuaig and Shepherd (1989), from Fujita, Kameda, and Yamashita (2000), and from Abbas, Egerstedt, Liu, Thomas, and Whalen (2016). Finally, we show that planar graphs of minimum degree at least $2$ and girth at least $g$ have fractional domatic number at least $3 - O(1/g)$ as $g\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Word Chain Generators for Prefix Normal Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2011, Fici and Lipt\'ak introduced prefix normal words. A binary word is prefix normal if it has no factor (substring) that contains more occurrences of the letter 1 than the prefix of the same length. Among the open problems regarding this topic are the enumeration of prefix normal words and efficient testing methods. We show a range of characteristics of prefix normal words. These include properties of factors that are responsible for a word not being prefix normal. With word chains and generators, we introduce new ways of relating words of the same length to each other.</description>

      <title>Examples of diameter-2 graphs with no triangle or $K_{2,t}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $t \ge 1$ let $W_t$ denote the class of graphs other than stars that have diameter $2$ and contain neither a triangle nor a $K_{2,t}$. The famous Hoffman--Singleton Theorem implies that $W_2$ is finite. Recently Wood suggested the study of $W_t$ for $t &gt; 2$ and conjectured that $W_t$ is finite for all $t \ge 2$. In this note we show that (1) $W_3$ is infinite, (2) $W_5$ contains infinitely many regular graphs, and (3) $W_7$ contains infinitely many Cayley graphs. Our $W_3$ and $W_5$ examples are based on so-called crooked graphs, first constructed by de Caen, Mathon, and Moorhouse. Our $W_7$ examples are Cayley graphs with vertex set $\mathbb{F}_p^2$ for prime $p \equiv 11 \pmod {12}$.</description>

      <title>Two results on set families: sturdiness and intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves two open problems in extremal set theory. For a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ and $i, j\in [n]$, we denote $\mathcal{F} (i,\bar{j})=\{F\backslash\{i\}: F\in \mathcal{F}, F\cap\{i,j\}=\{i\}\}$. The sturdiness $\beta (\mathcal{F})$ is defined as the minimum $|\mathcal{F} (i,\bar{j})|$ over all $i\neq j$. A family $\mathcal{F}$ is called an IU-family if it satisfies the intersection constraint: $F\cap F'\neq \emptyset $ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$, as well as the union constraint: $F\cup F' \neq [n]$ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$. The well-known IU-Theorem states that every IU-family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ has size at most $ 2^{n-2}$. In this paper, we prove that if $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is an IU-family, then $\beta (\mathcal{F})\le 2^{n-4}$. This confirms a recent conjecture proposed by Frankl and Wang.
  As the second result, we establish a tight upper bound on the sum of sizes of cross $t$-intersecting separated families. Our result not only extends a previous theorem of Frankl, Liu, Wang and Yang on separated families, but also provides explicit counterexamples to an open problem proposed by them, thereby settling their problem in the negative.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform pairwise cross $t$-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ n\geqslant t\geqslant 1$ and $ \mathcal{A}_1, \mathcal{A}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{A}_m \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ be non-empty families. We say that they are pairwise cross $t$-intersecting if $|A_i\cap A_j|\geqslant t$ holds for any $A_i\in \mathcal{A}_i$ and $A_j\in \mathcal{A}_j$ with $i\neq j$. In the case where $m=2$ and $\mathcal{A}_1=\mathcal{A}_2$, determining the maximum size $M(n,t)$ of a non-uniform $t$-intersecting family of sets over $[n]$ was solved by Katona (1964), and enhanced by Frankl (2017), and recently by Li and Wu (2024). In this paper, we establish the following upper bound: if $ \mathcal{A}_1, \mathcal{A}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{A}_m \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ are non-empty pairwise cross $t$-intersecting families, then $$ \sum_{i=1}^m |\mathcal{A}_i| \leqslant \max \left\{ \sum_{k=t} ^{n}\binom{n}{k} + m - 1, \, m M(n, t) \right\}. $$
  Furthermore, we provide a complete characterization of the extremal families that achieve the bound. Our result not only generalizes an old result of Katona (1964) for a single family, but also extends a theorem of Frankl and Wong (2021) for two families. Moreover, our result could be viewed as a non-uniform version of a recent theorem of Li and Zhang (2025). The key in our proof is to utilize the generating set method and the pushing-pulling method together.</description>

Abstract: We prove an inductive formula to construct a path from the highest weight element to any given vertex in the crystal graph of the polytope realization of the Kirillo-Reshetikhin crystal $KR^{i,m}$ of type $A$. For $i \le 2$ or $i \geq n-1$, we provide explicit formulas of the same by only using the lowering crystal operators and in those cases, using these paths, we determine the explicit image of any polytope under the affine crystal isomorphisms between the polytope and the tableau realizations of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To build new generalisations of Multiple Zeta Values, we define new spaces of formal series and formal integrals. We show that they are tridendriform and dendriform algebras. This allows us to reinterpret the fact that Multiple Zeta Values are algebra morphisms for shuffles of words in terms of finer tridendriform and dendriform structures. Applying universal properties of Schroeder trees we obtain generalisations of Multiple Zeta Values that are algebra morphisms for associative products. Hence we find new properties of Arborified Zeta Values and state how this enables the computation of some Shintani Zeta Values.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we classify cubic vertex-transitive graphs of girth $7$, based on their signature. Such a graph is either a truncation of an arc-transitive dihedral scheme on a $7$-regular graph, the skeleton of a rotary map of type $\{7,3\}$, a member of an infinite family of Cayley graphs, or is one of the of the generalised Petersen graphs $\text{Pet}(13,5)$, $\text{Pet}(15,4)$, $\text{Pet}(17,4)$ or the Coxeter graph. We show that for a cubic vertex-transitive graphs $\Gamma$ of girth $7$, if every edge of $\Gamma$ is contained in the same number of $7$-cycles, then $\Gamma$ is also arc-transitive.</description>

      <title>Line-parallelisms of PG$(n, 2)$ from Preparata-like codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partitions of the binary linear Hamming code into Preparata-like codes are known to induce line-parallelisms of PG$(n, 2)$. In this paper, we show that if $P$ is any Preparata-like code contained in the binary linear Hamming code $H$ of the same length, then $H$ can be partitioned into additive translates of $P$. This generalizes a result of Baker, van Lint, and Wilson who prove this fact for the class of generalized Preparata codes. We give an explicit description for line-parallelisms obtained from such a partition via crooked Preparata-like codes and establish an equivalence criterion for such line-parallelisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth form (or corona limit) of a tiling is the limit form of its coordination shells, i.e. its set of tiles located at a fixed distance from some tile. We give an overview of current results, conjectures and open questions about growth forms, including periodic, multigrid, substitution, and hat tilings.</description>

      <title>Effective Asymptotics of Combinatorial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics studies asymptotic properties of families of combinatorial objects using complex analysis on their generating functions. In their reference book on the subject, Flajolet and Sedgewick describe a general approach that allows one to derive precise asymptotic expansions starting from systems of combinatorial equations. In the situation where the combinatorial system involves only cartesian products and disjoint unions, the generating functions satisfy polynomial systems with positivity constraints for which many results and algorithms are known. We extend these results to the general situation. This produces an almost complete algorithmic chain going from combinatorial systems to asymptotic expansions. Thus, it is possible to compute asymptotic expansions of all generating functions produced by the symbolic method of Flajolet and Sedgewick when they have algebraic-logarithmic singularities (which can be decided), under the assumption that Schanuel's conjecture from number theory holds. That conjecture is not needed for systems that do not involve the constructions of sets and cycles.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Diameter Segments and A Discrete Borsuk Partition Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lattice diameter of a bounded set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ measures the maximal number of lattice points in a segment whose endpoints are lattice points in $S$. Such a segment is called a lattice diameter segment of $S$. This simple invariant yields interesting applications and challenges. We describe a polynomial-time algorithm that computes lattice diameter segments of lattice polygons and show that computing lattice diameters of semi-algebraic sets in dimensions three and higher is NP-hard. We prove that the function that counts lattice diameter segments in dilations of a lattice polygon is eventually a quasi-polynomial in the dilation factor. We also study the number of directions that lattice diameter segments can have. Finally, we prove a Borsuk-type theorem on the number of parts needed to partition a set of lattice points such that each part has strictly smaller lattice diameter.</description>

      <title>Hyperbinary partitions and q-deformed rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hyperbinary partition of the nonnegative integer n is a partition where every part is a power of 2 and every part appears at most twice. We give three applications of the length generating function for such partitions, denoted by h_q(n). Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko defined the q-analogue of a rational number [r/s]_q in various ways, most of which depend directly or indirectly on the continued fraction expansion of r/s. As our first application we show that [r/s]_q = q h_q(n-1)/h_q(n) where r/s occurs as the nth entry in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of the non-negative rationals. Next we consider fence posets which are those which can be obtained from a sequence of chains by alternately pasting together maxima and minima. For every n we show there is a fence poset F(n) whose lattice of order ideals is isomorphic to the poset of hyperbinary partitions of n ordered by refinement. For our last application, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko also showed that [r/s]_q can be computed by taking products of certain matrices which are q-analogues of the standard generators for the special linear group SL(2,R). We express the entries of these products in terms of the polynomials h_q(n).</description>

      <title>Approximating mixed volumes to arbitrary accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximating the mixed volume $V(P_1^{(\alpha_1)}, \dots, P_k^{(\alpha_k)})$ of an $k$-tuple of convex polytopes $(P_1, \dots, P_k)$, each of which is defined as the convex hull of at most $m_0$ points in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We design an algorithm that produces an estimate that is within a multiplicative $1 \pm \epsilon$ factor of the true mixed volume with a probability greater than $1 - \delta.$ Let the constant $ \prod_{i=2}^{k} \frac{(\alpha_{i}+1)^{\alpha_{i}+1}}{\alpha_{i}^{\,\alpha_{i}}}$ be denoted by $\tilde{A}$. When each $P_i \subseteq B_\infty(2^L)$, we show in this paper that the time complexity of the algorithm is bounded above by a polynomial in $n, m_0, L, \tilde{A}, \epsilon^{-1}$ and $\log \delta^{-1}$. In fact, a stronger result is proved in this paper, with slightly more involved terminology.
  In particular, we provide the first randomized polynomial time algorithm for computing mixed volumes of such polytopes when $k$ is an absolute constant, but $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k$ are arbitrary. Our approach synthesizes tools from convex optimization, the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, and polytope subdivision.</description>

      <title>Generalized Macdonald functions and quantum toroidal gl(1) algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warning Propagation is a combinatorial message passing algorithm that unifies and generalises a wide variety of recursive combinatorial procedures. Special cases include the Unit Clause Propagation and Pure Literal algorithms for satisfiability as well as the peeling process for identifying the $k$-core of a random graph. Here we analyse Warning Propagation in full generality on the binomial random graph. We prove that under a mild stability assumption Warning Propagation converges rapidly. In effect, the analysis of the fixed point of the message passing process on a random graph reduces to analysing the process on a Galton-Watson tree. This result corroborates and generalises a heuristic first put forward by Pittel, Spencer and Wormald in their seminal $k$-core paper (JCTB 1996).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scramble number of a graph, a natural generalization of bramble number, is an invariant recently developed to study chip-firing games and graph gonality. We introduce the carton number of a graph, defined to be the minimum size of a maximum order scramble, to study the computational complexity of scramble number. We show that there exist graphs with carton number exponential in the size of the graph, proving that scrambles are not valid NP certificates. We characterize families of graphs whose scramble number and gonality can be constant-factor approximated in polynomial time and show that the disjoint version of scramble number is fixed parameter tractable. Lastly, we find that vertex congestion is an upper bound on screewidth and thus scramble number, leading to a new proof of the best known bound on the treewidth of line graphs and a bound on the scramble number of planar graphs with bounded degree.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Reed's conjecture for digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reed in 1998 conjectured that every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil \frac{\Delta(G)+1+\omega(G)}{2} \rceil$. As a partial result, he proved the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for which every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\Delta(G)+1)+\varepsilon\omega(G) \rceil$. We propose an analogue conjecture for digraphs. Given a digraph $D$, we denote by $\vec{\chi}(D)$ the dichromatic number of $D$, which is the minimum number of colours needed to partition $D$ into acyclic induced subdigraphs. We let $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)$ denote the size of the largest biclique (a set of vertices inducing a complete digraph) of $D$ and $\tilde{\Delta}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \sqrt{d^+(v) \cdot d^-(v)}$. We conjecture that every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil \frac{\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1+\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)}{2} \rceil$, which if true implies Reed's conjecture. As a partial result, we prove the existence of $\varepsilon &gt;0$ for which every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1)+\varepsilon\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) \rceil$. This implies both Reed's result and an independent result of Harutyunyan and Mohar for oriented graphs.
  To obtain this upper bound on $\vec{\chi}$, we prove that every digraph $D$ with $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) &gt; \frac{2}{3}(\Delta_{\max}(D)+1)$, where $\Delta_{\max}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \max(d^+(v),d^-(v))$, admits an acyclic set of vertices intersecting each biclique of $D$, which generalises a result of King.
  We finally give a short proof that all oriented graphs $D$ satisfy $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \Tilde{\Delta}(D) + 2$, improving on a result of Golowich.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bicirculant is a regular, $d$-valent graph that admits a semiregular automorphism of order $m$ having two vertex-orbits of size $m$. The vertices of each orbit induce a circulant graph of order $m$ and the remaining edges span a regular bipartite graph of valence, say $s$, $1 \leq s \leq d$, connecting the two vertex-orbits. Generalized Petersen graphs constitute a prominent family of bicirculants, with $d = 3$ and $s = 1$. In 1983, Brian Alspach proved that all generalized Petersen graphs are hamiltonian, except for the family $G(m, 2)$ with $m\equiv 5\pmod 6$. In this paper we conjecture that among all connected bicirculants of valence at least 2, there are no other exceptions. It follows from various sources that the conjecture is true for all cubic bicirculants. In this paper we prove the conjecture for quartic bicirulants with $s = 2$, also known as the generalized rose window graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $r \geq 0$, and let $\lambda$ and $\mu$ be partitions such that $\lambda_1 \leq r + 1$. We present a combinatorial interpretation of the plethysm coefficient $\langle s_\lambda, s_\mu[s_r] \rangle$. As a consequence, we solve the restriction problem for partitions with at most three columns. That is, for all partitions $\lambda$ with $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, we find a combinatorial interpretation for the multiplicities of the irreducible $\mathfrak{S}_n$-submodules of the Schur module $\mathbb{S}^\lambda \mathbb{C}^n$, considered as an $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module.</description>

Abstract: Incidence-based generalizations of cycle covers, called contributors, extend the Harary-Sachs coefficient theorem for characteristic polynomials of the adjacency matrix of graphs. All minors of the Laplacian resulting from an integer matrix are characterized using their associated oriented hypergraph through a new minimal collection of contributors to produce the coefficients of the total-minor polynomial. We prove that the natural grouping of contributors via tail-equivalence is necessarily cancellative for any contributor family that reuses an edge. We then provide a new combinatorial proof on the non-0 isospectrality of the traditional characteristic polynomials of the Laplacian and its dual.</description>

      <title>Strong spectral stabilities for $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stability result due to Ren, Wang, Wang and Yang [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 38 (2024)] shows that if $3\le r \le 2k$ and $n\ge 318 (r-2)^2k$, and $G$ is a $C_{2k+1}$-free graph on $n$ vertices with $e(G)\ge \lfloor {(n-r+1)^2}/{4}\rfloor +{r \choose 2}$, then $G$ can be made bipartite by deleting at most $r-2$ vertices. Using a different method, we give a linear bound on $n$ in terms of $k$ and show a stronger structural result, which roughly says that $G$ can be obtained from a large bipartite graph by suspending some small graphs that the total number of vertices is at most $r-2$. This improves a result of Yan and Peng (2024) by weakening the requirement on $n$ and $k$. As a direct corollary, we obtain a tight upper bound on the size of an $n$-vertex $C_{2k+1}$-free graph with chromatic number $\chi (G)\ge r$ for every $r\le 2k$. The second part of this paper concerns the spectral extremal problem for $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs. We denote by $\lambda (G)$ the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$. Let $T_{n-r+1,2}\circ K_r$ be the graph obtained by identifying a vertex of the complete graph $K_r$ and a vertex of the smaller partite set of the bipartite Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n-r+1 ,2}$. Using the spectral techniques, we prove that if $3\le r\le 2k$ and $n\ge 712k$, and $G$ is an $n$-vertex $C_{2k+1}$-free graph with chromatic number $\chi (G) \ge r$, then $\lambda (G)\le \lambda (T_{n-r+1,2}\circ K_r)$, where the equality holds if and only if $G=T_{n-r+1,2}\circ K_r$. Our result not only extends a result of Guo, Lin and Zhao [Linear Algebra Appl. 627 (2021)] as well as a result of Zhang and Zhao [Discrete Math. 346 (2023)], but also provides the first solution to the spectral extremal problem for $F$-free graphs with high chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Watson-Crick conjugates of words and languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03123v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the concept of Watson-Crick conjugates, also known as $\theta$-conjugates (where $\theta$ is an antimorphic involution), of words and languages. This concept extends the classical idea of conjugates by incorporating the Watson-Crick complementarity of DNA sequences. Our investigation initially focuses on the properties of $\theta$-conjugates of words. We then define $\theta$-conjugates of a language and study closure properties of certain families of languages under the $\theta$-conjugate operation. Furthermore, we analyze the iterated $\theta$-conjugate of both words and languages. Finally, we discuss the idea of $\theta$-conjugate-free languages and examine some decidability problems related to it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of convex geometry over ordered hyperfields. We define convex sets and halfspaces over ordered hyperfields, presenting structure theorems over hyperfields arising as quotients of fields. We prove hyperfield analogues of Helly, Radon and Carath\'eodory theorems. We also show that arbitrary convex sets can be separated via hemispaces. Comparing with classical convexity, we begin classifying hyperfields for which halfspace separation holds. In the process, we demonstrate many properties of ordered hyperfields, including a classification of stringent ordered hyperfields.</description>

      <title>Motivic Coh and Quot zeta functions of singular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We show that the Coh zeta function can be recovered as a transparent high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to the enumerative geometry of affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Brick-splitting Torsion Pairs and Left Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of brick-splitting torsion pairs as a modern analogue and generalization of the classical notion of splitting torsion pairs. A torsion pair is called brick-splitting if any given brick is either torsion or torsion-free with respect to that torsion pair. After giving some properties of these pairs, we fully characterize them in terms of some lattice-theoretical properties, including left modularity. This leads to the notion of brick-directed algebras, which are those for which there does not exist any cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms between bricks. This class of algebras is a novel generalization of representation-directed algebras. We show that brick-directed algebras have many interesting properties and give several characterizations of them. In particular, we prove that a brick-finite algebra is brick-directed if and only if the lattice of torsion classes is left modular (or equivalently, extremal). We also give a characterization of brick-directed algebras in terms of their wall-and-chamber structure, as well as of a certain Newton polytope associated to them. Moreover, we introduce an explicit construction of an abundance of brick-directed algebras, both of the tame and wild representation types.</description>

      <title>Complementary edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $K$ and $I\subset S$ be a squarefree monomial ideal generated in degree $n-2$. Motivated by the remarkable behavior of the powers of $I$ when $I$ admits a linear resolution, as established in [11], in this work we investigate the algebraic and homological properties of $I$ and its powers. To this end, we introduce the complementary edge ideal of a finite simple graph $G$ as the ideal $$I_c(G)=((x_1\cdots x_n)/(x_ix_j):\{i,j\}\in E(G)) $$ of $S$, where $V(G)=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $E(G)$ is the edge set of $G$. By interpreting any squarefree monomial ideal $I$ generated in degree $n-2$ as the complementary edge ideal of a graph $G$, we establish a correspondence between algebraic invariants of $I$ and combinatorial properties of $G$. More precisely, we characterize sequentially Cohen-Macaulay, Cohen-Macaulay, Gorenstein, nearly Gorenstein and matroidal complementary edge ideals. Moreover, we determine the regularity of powers of $I$ in terms of combinatorial invariants of the graph $G$ and obtain that $I^k$ has linear resolution or linear quotients for some $k$ (equivalently for all $k\geq 1$) if and only if $G$ has only one connected component with at least two vertices.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Notes on Symbolic Constraints in Polyhedral Enclosure and Tetrahedral Decomposition in Genus-0 Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a coordinate-free, symbolic framework for deciding whether a given set of polygonal faces can form a closed, genus-zero polyhedral surface and for predicting how such a surface could be decomposed into internal tetrahedra. The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in normal form, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges within a shell-aligned ladder subclass (SALT), where at most one interior edge is introduced per layer. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</description>
