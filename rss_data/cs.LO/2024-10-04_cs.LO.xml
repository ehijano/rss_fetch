      <title>Is uniform expressivity too restrictive? Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo &amp; al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</description>

      <title>Measuring, Evaluating and Improving Logical Consistency in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising progress related to LLM alignment with human preferences. LLM-empowered decision-making systems are expected to be predictable, reliable and trustworthy, which implies being free from paradoxes or contradictions that could undermine their credibility and validity. However, LLMs still exhibit inconsistent and biased behaviour when making decisions or judgements. In this work, we focus on studying logical consistency of LLMs as a prerequisite for more reliable and trustworthy systems. Logical consistency ensures that decisions are based on a stable and coherent understanding of the problem, reducing the risk of erratic or contradictory outputs. We first propose a universal framework to quantify the logical consistency via three fundamental proxies: transitivity, commutativity and negation invariance. We then evaluate logical consistency, using the defined measures, of a wide range of LLMs, demonstrating that it can serve as a strong proxy for overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce a data refinement and augmentation technique that enhances the logical consistency of LLMs without sacrificing alignment to human preferences. It augments noisy and sparse pairwise-comparison annotations by estimating a partially or totally ordered preference rankings using rank aggregation methods. Finally, we show that logical consistency impacts the performance of LLM-based logic-dependent algorithms, where LLMs serve as logical operators.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Weihrauch degree of the problems ``find a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order'' ($\mathsf{BS}$) and ``find a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order'' ($\mathsf{DS}$). We prove that $\mathsf{DS}$ is strictly Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{BS}$, correcting our mistaken claim in [arXiv:2010.03840]. This is done by separating their respective first-order parts. On the other hand, we show that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have the same finitary and deterministic parts, confirming that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have very similar uniform computational strength. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ or $\mathsf{BS}$, resolving two main open questions raised in [arXiv:2010.03840]. We also answer the question, raised in [arXiv:1804.10968], on the existence of a ``parallel quotient'' operator, and study the behavior of $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ under the quotient with some known problems.</description>
