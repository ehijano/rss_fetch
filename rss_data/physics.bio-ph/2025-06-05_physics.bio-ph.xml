      <title>3D Holographic Flow Cytometry Measurements of Microalgae: Strategies for Angle Recovery in Complex Rotation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine ecosystems are in the spotlight, because environmental changes are threatening biodiversity and ecological functions. In this context, microalgae play key ecological roles both in planktonic and benthic ecosystems. Consequently, they are considered indispensable targets for global monitoring programs. However, due to a high spatial and temporal variability and to difficulties of species identification (still relying on microscopy observations), the assessment of roles played by these components of marine ecosystems is demanding. In addition, technologies for a 3D assessment of their complex morphology are scarcely available. Here, we present a comprehensive workflow for retrieving 3D information on microalgae with diverse geometries through holographic microscopy operating in flow-cytometry mode. Depending on the rotation patterns of samples, a tailored approach is used to retrieve their rolling angles. We demonstrate the feasibility of measuring 3D data of various microalgae, contingent to the intrinsic optical properties of cells. Specifically, we show that for quasi-transparent and low-scattering microorganisms, the retrieved angles permit to achieve quantitative 3D tomographic Refractive Index (RI) mapping, providing a full characterization of the alga in terms of its inner structure and the outer shape. Moreover, even in the most challenging scenarios, where microalgae exhibit high light absorption or strong scattering, quantitative 3D shape reconstructions of diatoms and dinoflagellates can be at least achieved. Finally, we compare our direct 3D measurements with 2D inferences of 3D properties, obtained using a commercially available microscopy system. The ability to non-invasively obtain 3D information on microalgae marks a fundamental advancement in the field, unlocking a wealth of novel biological insights for characterizing aquatic ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Defect states in compressible active polar fluids with turnover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological active matter like the cytoskeleton or tissues are characterized by their ability to transform chemical energy into mechanical stress. In addition, it often exhibits orientational order, which is essential for many cellular and morphogenetic processes. Experimental evidence suggests that defects in the orientational order field play an important role in organizing active stress. However, defects tend to annihilate unless the material is in a chaotic state or hydrodynamic interactions are suppressed. Using a hydrodynamic description of compressible active polar fluids, we show that turnover readily leads to a stabilization of defects. Depending on the turnover rate, topological defects arrange in a multitude of different phases, including lattices, active foams, and vortex glasses. Our work suggests that turnover plays a crucial role for organizing biological active matter.</description>

      <title>Image-based physical characterization of magnetotactic bacteria from an environmental sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a diverse group of microorganisms that are able to biomineralize magnetic nanoparticles. Most MTB remain uncultured, making population-level characterization from natural environments difficult. We report the discovery of a new and diverse MTB-rich site in the Ogre River, Latvia, and present an integrated approach combining 16S rRNA sequencing, transmission electron microscopy, and novel open-source, automated image-based physical methods to characterize bacteria populations within environmental samples. We introduce a pipeline for cell velocimetry using a static magnetic field and a method to classify cell populations based on their magnetic moment using a modified U-turn method where cell behavior is studied in an alternating magnetic field. This study demonstrates that our physical analysis methods provide a powerful, fast, and robust toolset for MTB population analysis in complex environmental samples.</description>

      <title>Biological Processes as Exploratory Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological processes can be thought of as the result of an underlying dynamics in which the system repeatedly undergoes distinct and abortive trajectories with the dynamical process only ending when some specific process, purpose, structure or function is achieved. A classic example is the way in which microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome segregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then stacked against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series of repeated trials that ultimately end in a "winning" trajectory. We also explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such processes.</description>

      <title>Complex rheology of condensin in entangled DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural-Maintenance-of-Chromosome (SMC) complexes such as condensins are well-known to dictate the folding and entanglement of interphase and mitotic chromosomes. However, their role in modulating the rheology and viscoelasticity of entangled DNA is not fully understood. In this work, we discover that physiological concentrations of yeast condensin increase both the effective viscosity and elasticity of dense solutions of $\lambda$-DNA even in absence of ATP. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule imaging, we discover that yeast condensin can proficiently bind double-stranded DNA through its hinge domain, in addition to its heads. We further discover that presence of ATP fluidifies the entangled solution possibly by activating loop extrusion. Finally, we show that the observed rheology can be understood by modelling SMCs as transient crosslinkers in bottle-brush-like entangled polymers. Our findings help us to understand how SMCs affect the rheology and dynamics of the genome.</description>

      <title>Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</description>

      <title>Competitive binding of Activator-Repressor in Stochastic Gene Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulation of gene expression is the consequence of interactions between the promoter of the gene and the transcription factors (TFs). In this paper, we explore the features of a genetic network where the TFs (activators and repressors) bind the promoter in a competitive way. We develop an analytical theory that offers detailed reaction kinetics of the competitive activator-repressor system which could be the powerful tools for extensive study and analysis of the genetic circuit in future research. Moreover, the theoretical approach helps us to find a most probable set of parameter values which was unavailable in experiments. We study the noisy behaviour of the circuit and compare the profile with the network where the activator and repressor bind the promoter non-competitively. We further notice that, due to the effect of transcriptional reinitiation in the presence of the activator and repressor molecules, there exits some anomalous characteristic features in the mean expressions and noise profiles. We find that, in presence of the reinitiation the noise in transcriptional level remains low while it is higher in translational level than the noise when the reinitiation is absent. In addition, it is possible to reduce the noise further below the Poissonian level in competitive circuit than the non-competitive one with the help of some noise reducing parameters.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Nodal Modularity: A novel network metric for the regional analysis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment during a working memory binding task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Brain networks are known to exhibit community structure at local, meso, and global scale. However, modularity is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure, overlooking important variations in community structure at node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity (nQ) captures both mesoscale and local-scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that nQ would illuminate granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored nQ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. While limited by sample size, changes in nQ for individual regions of interest (ROIs) in our fMRI networks were predominantly observed in visual, limbic, and paralimbic systems in the brain, aligning with known AD trajectories and linked to amyloid-$\beta$ and tau deposition. Furthermore, observed changes in white-matter microstructure in our DTI networks in parietal and frontal regions may compliment studies of white-matter integrity in poor memory binders. Additionally, nQ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters indicating that nQ may be sensitive to this key turning point of AD. Our findings demonstrate the utility of nQ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into task and disease-related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, nQ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as AI Agents for Digital Atoms and Molecules: Catalyzing a New Era in Computational Biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computational biophysics, where molecular data is expanding rapidly and system complexity is increasing exponentially, large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems are fundamentally reshaping the field. This perspective article examines the recent advances at the intersection of LLMs, intelligent agents, and scientific computation, with a focus on biophysical computation. Building on these advancements, we introduce ADAM (Agent for Digital Atoms and Molecules), an innovative multi-agent LLM-based framework. ADAM employs cutting-edge AI architectures to reshape scientific workflows through a modular design. It adopts a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture that combines LLM-driven semantic tools with deterministic symbolic computations. Moreover, its ADAM Tool Protocol (ATP) enables asynchronous, database-centric tool orchestration, fostering community-driven extensibility. Despite the significant progress made, ongoing challenges call for further efforts in establishing benchmarking standards, optimizing foundational models and agents, building an open collaborative ecosystem and developing personalized memory modules. ADAM is accessible at https://sidereus-ai.com.</description>
