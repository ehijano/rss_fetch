      <title>Toward Expert Investment Teams:A Multi-Agent LLM System with Fine-Grained Trading Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage on Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized exchanges using automated market makers create arbitrage opportunities with centralized exchanges, where gas fees and transaction ordering are critical. Existing models largely overlook competition among arbitrageurs, despite price discrepancies being public information. We develop the first equilibrium model of gas fee competition between two arbitrageurs under three transaction reversion settings: no-revert, auto-revert, and selectable-revert. We show that pure symmetric equilibria do not exist, but unique mixed equilibria can be characterized. Comparative analysis reveals that under low inventory risk, the no-revert setting favors arbitrageurs in terms of profit, while auto-revert and selectable-revert settings enhance market efficiency. Under high inventory risk, the no-revert and selectable-revert settings dominate the auto-revert setting in both profitability and efficiency. Using data from Binance and Uniswap V2, we empirically confirm that arbitrageurs face positive inventory risk and validate our model's implications: gas fees increase with price discrepancies and liquidity, while trading amounts rise with both price discrepancies and gas fees.</description>
