      <title>Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics VII: Supermassive Black Hole at very high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at very high redshift hosted by massive galaxy provide a challenge to the SMBH and massive galaxy formation models which are predicated on the Lambda CDM model that predicts a Hubble constant currently in tension with late time observations. In a gravitational system with two asymptotic solutions such as a central mass in an expanding cosmological background or an expanding background with radiation and baryons, we find that a particle's free falling speed resulting from adding the free falling speeds due to the asymptotic solutions is also a theoretically viable solution [1]-[2]. In this work, we use this new model to examine the SMBH formation time-line and find that the change in the redshift-cosmological time relation provides sufficent cosmological time for the formation of SMBHs at high redshifts. We also find that the Hubble parameter-redshift relation in this model is consistent with late time observation at z&lt;1.</description>

      <title>Multi-cloud crushing -- the collective survival of cold clouds in galactic outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ram-pressure acceleration of cold gas by hot outflows plays a crucial role in the dynamics of multiphase galactic winds. Recent numerical studies incorporating radiative cooling have identified a size threshold for idealized cold clouds to survive within high-velocity outflows. This study extends the investigation to a more complex morphology of cold gas as observed in the interstellar medium. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of ensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which conditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can survive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be rapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors such as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation facilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that accounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas mass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling fraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a composite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind, incorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions scale with the critical survival radius $r_{\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud criterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\rm crit}}\approx 0.24$ that robustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric configurations. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of initial cloud distribution and fragmentation in governing the long-term evolution and survival of cold gas structures, providing insight into observed multiphase outflows and CGM dynamics.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: A Spectroscopic Census of Little Red Dots; All V-Shaped Point Sources Have Broad Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) - a population of compact, red galaxies revealed by JWST - remains unclear. Photometric samples are constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of $\sim$1500 galaxies at $z &gt; 3.1$. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra, yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35%) at $z &gt; 6$. A large subpopulation naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting `v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high accuracy, down to $\rm F444W&lt;26.5$, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric criteria require refinement to capture the full population.</description>

      <title>The DECam Field of Streams: a deep view of the Milky Way halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Field of Streams visualizing stellar structures in the Milky Way halo as viewed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). We use $g$- and $r$-band imaging from the Dark Energy Survey and the DECam Legacy Survey, covering $18{,}700 \deg^2$ across the sky. Using an isochrone-based matched filter in $g$ vs. $g-r$, we select old and metal-poor stars in three distance bins, and generate a false-color RGB image of the number density of selected stars. The DECam Field of Streams shows a variety of Milky Way halo structures, including dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and an abundance of stellar streams, illustrating the significant progress that has been made in recent years in uncovering the building blocks of the Milky Way's stellar halo in deep, wide-area photometric surveys. This view of our Galaxy will be improved in the coming years as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) begins to collect data to greater depths and across a larger fraction of the sky than ever before.</description>

      <title>Probing neutral outflows in z ~ 2 galaxies using JWST observations of Ca II H and K absorption lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the Blue Jay survey, we perform the first systematic investigation of neutral gas content in massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon based on the Ca II H, K absorption lines. We analyze a sample of 9 galaxies at 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 with stellar masses &gt; 10.6, for which we detect neutral gas absorption both in Ca II and in Na I. After removing the stellar continuum using the best-fit model obtained with Prospector, we fit the excess absorption due to neutral gas in the Ca II H, K doublet and in the Na I D doublet, together with nearby emission lines produced by ionized gas. We measure covering fractions between 0.2 and 0.9 from the Ca II H and K lines, which are spectrally well resolved in the NIRSpec R ~ 1000 observations, unlike the absorption lines in the Na I D doublet. We measure the velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and column density separately for Ca II and Na I. About half of the galaxies present blueshifted Ca II, indicative of an outflow of neutral gas, consistent with previous results based on Na I. The velocity shift and the column density measured from Ca II are correlated with those measured from Na I, implying that these absorption lines trace gas in similar physical conditions. However, the column densities are not in a 1:1 relation, meaning that the relative amount of Ca II and Na I atoms along the line of sight varies with the gas column density. After discussing possible reasons for this behavior, we derive an empirical relation between the column density of Ca II and the column density of Na I and, in a more indirect way, of neutral hydrogen H I. This calibration offers a new way to estimate the outflow mass and the mass outflow rate for the neutral phase from current and future JWST observations of massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon and beyond</description>

      <title>Jellyfish galaxies with the IllustrisTNG simulations -- Supermassive black hole activity in dense environments with ram-pressure stripped satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies are extreme examples of how galaxies can transform due to dense environmental effects. These satellite galaxies suffer from ram-pressure stripping, leading to the formation of their distinctive gaseous tails. Some recent observational studies find that jellyfish galaxies are more likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to central galaxies of the same mass, suggesting a link between ram pressure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological-magnetohydrodynamical simulations, namely TNG50 and TNG100, to explore the presence of AGN in jellyfish galaxies with $M_{\rm{stellar}}\simeq10^{9.5-10.8}\,\rm{M}_\odot$ at redshift $z=0$ from the Zooniverse "Cosmological Jellyfish" citizen-science project. Compared to central galaxies, jellyfish are more likely to host an AGN ($L_{\rm AGN}\geq10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) particularly at high stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Jellyfish are also more likely to host an AGN than satellites of the same mass, largely because many satellite galaxies are gas-poor and therefore have lower SMBH accretion rates. Compared to non-jellyfish satellites with similar gas content, jellyfish typically undergo stronger ram pressure and have higher central gas densities along with lower central gas sound speeds, although these effects are smaller at lower stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\lesssim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Together with case studies of individual galaxies, our population analysis indicates that ram pressure can play a key role in fuelling AGN activity in a large fraction of jellyfish, where gas compression can lead to intense episodes of AGN feedback and star formation. Thus, it is essential to consider both environmental and secular processes for a more complete picture of satellite galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring the halo occupation distribution for moderate X-ray luminosity active galactic nuclei in the EAGLE cosmological simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamical cosmological simulation \eagle{} is used to model the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) of moderate X-ray luminosity active galactic nuclei (mXAGN), extending previous work using only dark matter simulations and empirical relations. By examining mergers as a triggering mechanism, we focus on halos typical of galaxy groups and cluster-like systems with masses $\geq 10^{12.75}\,{\rm M}{\odot}\,h^{-1}$. We analyze simulation data to create catalogs of central and satellite galaxies. We study their merger history we quantify the percentage of minor and major mergers in the mXAGN sample. We obtain the HOD for central and satellite mXAGN across a redshift interval from \(z=2\) to the present epoch. Our results indicate that, across most redshifts, minor mergers slightly predominate as the primary mechanism for triggering mXAGN.</description>

      <title>A map of the outer gas disk of the Galaxy with direct distances from young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For more than fifty years, astronomers have mapped the neutral hydrogen gas in the Galaxy assuming kinematically derived distances. We employ the distances of nearby young stars, which trace the gas from which they formed, in longitude-latitude-velocity space to map this gas without using kinematic distances. We denote this new method "pattern matching". Analysis of simulated spiral galaxies indicates that our pattern matching distances are 24% more accurate than kinematic distances for gas within 15 kpc of the Sun. The two methods provide similar agreement with parallaxes towards these masers, although the kinematic method shows a small systematic offset in the distance that is not present in the pattern matching distance. Using parallaxes and velocities for masers, we show that this novel method, when matched with nearby Cepheids, performs well compared to kinematics. This analysis is restricted to sources that have a reasonably good match with a member of our Cepheid sample. The distances derived here, and the associated map, have broad utility - from improving our understanding of star formation and the dynamical structure of the Galaxy, to informing 3-D dust maps.</description>

      <title>Survival of dust in super-dusty galaxies at redshifts $z \approx 5-8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dust in galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;5$ is commonly connected with core collapse supernovae (SN). Galaxies with exceptionally large dust mass, of order of $1 - 3$\% of the galaxy stellar mass, have been detected during the last decade. The required SN dust yield is $\gtrsim 1~M_\odot$ per supernova, which is comparable to the theoretically predicted maximum. However, the reverse shock (RS) penetrating the SN ejecta significantly destroy the dust particles nucleating there through sputtering. The resulting net dust mass injected into the interstellar gas after processing by the RS turns out to be $\lesssim 0.1~M_\odot$ per SN. This makes the explanation of the existence of $z&gt;5$ galaxies with dust masses as high as $M_d\gtrsim (0.01-0.03)M_\ast$ a challenging one. In this paper we present arguments in favor of an efficient inhibition of the sputtering behind the RS, caused by a strong radiation cooling from the dust in the supernova ejecta.</description>

      <title>Trinity VII. Predictions for the Observable Correlation Functions of Accreting Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasar correlation function assesses the occurrence of quasar pairs as a function of separation, which is strongly influenced by quasar host halo masses. The empirical Trinity model recently inferred the redshift-dependent relationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, galaxy mass, and halo mass, using constraints other than correlation functions (e.g., quasar luminosity functions, active galactic nuclei occupation fractions, and SMBH mass-bulge mass relations). Hence, comparing the predicted quasar correlation functions from Trinity to real observations is an important test of Trinity's inferred SMBH -- halo relation. In this work, we use a compilation of observed two-point projected and redshift-space correlation functions from $0 \leq z \leq 3.5$. We find that Trinity accurately predicts quasar correlation functions within observed error bars, although observations do not have much constraining power at lower redshifts due to smaller observable volumes and lower quasar number densities. This finding is consistent with Trinity having the correct placement of quasars within their host galaxies and dark matter halos, without requiring quasar clustering constraints during model fitting. Using Trinity, we also predict the clustering as a function of quasar bolometric luminosity, finding that existing survey uncertainties are too large to show measurable differences ($\lesssim 0.3$ dex change in bias for $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ compared to $10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ SMBHs across redshifts). This fact arises because most SMBH growth (and hence quasar luminosity) occurs in halos in a similar mass range ($10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot$).</description>

      <title>Puzzling radial gradients of K-band absorption features in the giant elliptical galaxy M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new K-band spectroscopy for the giant elliptical galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster, taken with the LUCI spectrograph at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The new data are used to study line-strengths of K-band absorption features from different chemical species, namely Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, and CO, as a function of galactocentric distance, out to 40arcsec from the center (about half of the galaxy effective radius). The radial trends of spectral indices are compared to those for the bulge of M31, observed with the same instrument. For M87, most K-band indices exhibit flat radial profiles, with the exception of NaI2.21, that decreases outwards, with a negative radial gradient. Significant offsets are found between indices for M87 and those for the bulge of M31, the latter having weaker line-strengths for almost all features, but Fe and Ca, for which we find similar trends in both systems. We find that the behavior of CO features - most prominent in giant stars - is difficult to explain, consistent with previous results for the central regions of massive galaxies. In particular, the CO indices are stronger in M87 than M31, and do not exhibit significant radial gradients in M87, despite its IMF being bottom heavier than M31 especially in its central region. Predictions of state-of-the-art stellar population models, based on results from the optical spectral range, are able to match only the Na and Ca indices of M87, while a significant mismatch is found for all other indices. This shows that state-of-the-art stellar population models should be improved significantly in order to provide reliable constraints on the stellar population content of galaxies in the NIR spectral range.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mass distribution and velocity structure of the Galactic centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner ~200 pc region of the Milky Way contains a nuclear stellar disc and a nuclear star cluster that are embedded in the larger Galactic bar. These stellar systems overlap spatially, which makes it challenging to separate stars that belong to the nuclear stellar systems, to deduce their internal dynamics, and to derive the central Galactic potential. Discrete stellar kinematics probe the mass distribution of a stellar system, and chemical tracers such as stellar metallicity can further separate multiple stellar populations that can have distinct kinematic properties. We took advantage of the information provided by discrete stellar kinematics and the metallicity in the Galactic centre using discrete chemo-dynamical modelling. We fitted axisymmetric Jeans models to discrete data of 4,600 stars. We fitted the stars as either one population plus a background component or as two populations plus a background that represents the bar. We tested the robustness of the inferred gravitational potential against a varying mass of the supermassive black hole, including dark matter, or a radially varying mass-to-light ratio. We obtained robust results on the fit with a single population and a background component. We obtained a supermassive black hole mass of (4.35$\pm 0.24) \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$, and we find that a dark matter component and radial variation in the mass-to-light ratio are negligible. We derived the enclosed mass profile of the inner ~60 pc and found a lower mass than reported in the literature in the region of ~5-30 pc. In our two-population fit, we found a high-[M/H] population that contributes more than 90% to the total stellar density. The properties of the high-[M/H] population are consistent with in situ formation after gas inflow from the Galactic disc via the bar. The distinct kinematic properties of the low-[M/H] population indicate a different origin. [abridged]</description>

Abstract: OH megamasers (OHMs) are extragalactic masers found primarily in gas-rich galaxy major mergers. To date, only $\sim$120 OHMs have been cataloged since their discovery in 1982, and efforts to identify distinct characteristics of OHM host galaxies have remained inconclusive. As radio astronomy advances with next-generation telescopes and extensive 21 cm HI surveys, precursors to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are expected to detect the 18 cm OH masing line with significantly increased frequency, potentially expanding the known OHM population tenfold. These detections, however, risk confusion with lower-redshift HI emitters unless accompanied by independent spectroscopic redshifts. Building on methods proposed by Roberts et al. (arXiv:2102.12486) for distinguishing these interloping OHMs via near- to mid-IR photometry and emission line frequencies, we apply these techniques to data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA [Arecibo L-band Feed Array] (ALFALFA) survey and a preliminary APERture Tile In Focus (Apertif) HI emission line catalog from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. Our study, utilizing the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m telescope to obtain optical spectroscopic redshifts of 142 candidates (107 from ALFALFA and 35 from Apertif), confirms five new OHM host galaxies and reidentifies two previously catalogued OHMs misclassified as HI emitters in ALFALFA. These findings support the predictions from Roberts et al. (arXiv:2102.12486 [astro-ph.GA]) and underscore the evolving landscape of radio astronomy in the context of next-generation telescopes.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Hydrostatic Equilibrium in the Extragalactic Molecular Clouds of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the density structure of turbulent molecular clouds in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, aligns with expectations from hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE). This study extends the study of the M31 clouds by matching their observed surface densities to a spatially-averaged solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The results affirm that the M31 molecular clouds exhibit density profiles expected from HE, further supporting the earlier conclusion that VE holds at all radii within the clouds. This study also discusses HE in the context of the turbulent interstellar medium, considering energy balance, cloud lifetimes, and the pressure of the interstellar medium. A comparison between the Galactic and extragalactic clouds indicates that both share similar dynamical states. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interplay between turbulence, gravitational stability, and cloud evolution in the molecular interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe, (pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies. We also discuss their implications for transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Faint absorption of the ground state hyperfine-splitting transitions of hydroxyl at 18 cm in the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar hydride hydroxyl (OH) is a potential tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. We present new absorption line observations of OH at 18-cm wavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21 cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of [CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand, and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures typical of HII regions.</description>

      <title>ALMA polarimetry of radio-quiet AGNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compact mm emission ubiquitously found in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) exhibits properties consistent with synchrotron radiation from a small region ($\leq$1 light day) and undergoing self-absorption below $\sim$100 GHz. Several scenarios have been proposed for its origin, including an X-ray corona, a scaled-down jet, or outflow-driven shocks, which can be tested via mm polarimetry. In the optically thin regime, synchrotron emission is expected to show polarization up to $\sim$70\%, but disordered magnetic fields and Faraday rotation reduce this to a few percent for jets and outflows, while an X-ray corona is likely to result in complete depolarization. To investigate this, we conducted the first ALMA Band 3 full-polarization observations of three RQ AGN - NGC 3783, MCG 5-23-16, and NGC 4945. No polarized signal was detected in any of the AGN, with an upper limit of 0.5-1.5\%, supporting the X-ray corona scenario. However, we detected a compact source with 17\% polarization in NGC 3783, 20 pc away from the AGN, co-spatial with the mm and narrow-line outflow, likely linked to a shock propagating through the outflowing material. Additionally, combining our data with archival ALMA observations, we found typical mm variability in RQ AGN by a factor of 2; however, the sparsity of the data prevented a more detailed analysis of the total flux variability.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>To collapse or not to collapse: Halo evolution with self-interacting dark matter mass segregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase, where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe which typical SIDM models are subject to. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM model consisting of two species with unequal masses, featuring only interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing $N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, the mass segregation caused by the unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species models, offering a rich phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stellar systems with collisions: eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in nearly collisionless limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the decay of perturbations in an infinite homogeneous self-gravitating model with a Maxwellian distribution function (DF) when weak collisions are present. In collisionless systems within the stable parameter range, the eigenvalue spectrum consists of a continuous set of real frequencies associated with van Kampen modes, which are singular eigenfunctions of the stellar DF. An initial perturbation in the stellar density and gravitational potential decays exponentially through a superposition of these modes, a phenomenon known as Landau damping. However, the perturbation in the stellar DF does not decay self-similarly; it becomes increasingly oscillatory in velocity space over time, indicating the absence of eigenfunctions corresponding to the Landau damping eigenfrequencies. Consequently, we refer to perturbations undergoing Landau damping as quasi-modes rather than true eigenmodes. Even rare collisions suppress the formation of steep DF gradients in velocity space. C. S. Ng &amp; A. Bhattacharjee demonstrated that introducing collisions eliminates van Kampen modes and transforms Landau quasi-modes into true eigenmodes forming a complete set. As the collision frequency approaches zero, their eigenfrequencies converge to those of the collisionless Landau quasi-modes. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the eigenfunction of the least-damped aperiodic mode as the collision frequency approaches zero. We derive analytic expressions for the eigenfunction in the resonance region and for the damping rate as a function of collision frequency. Additionally, we employ the standard matrix eigenvalue problem approach to numerically verify our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Microphysics of Circumgalactic Turbulence Probed by Fast Radio Bursts and Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is poorly constrained at the sub-parsec scales relevant to turbulent energy dissipation and regulation of multi-phase structure. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sensitive to small-scale plasma density fluctuations, which can induce multipath propagation (scattering). The amount of scattering depends on the density fluctuation spectrum, including its amplitude $C_{\rm n}^2$, spectral index $\beta$, and dissipation scale $l_{\rm i}$. We use quasar observations of CGM turbulence at $\gtrsim$ pc scales to infer $C_{\rm n}^2$, finding it to be $10^{-16}\lesssim C_{\rm n}^2\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m$^{-20/3}$ for hot ($T&gt;10^6$ K) gas and $10^{-8}\lesssim C_{\rm n}^2\lesssim 10^{-4}$ m$^{-20/3}$ for cool ($10^4\lesssim T\lesssim 10^5$ K) gas, depending on the gas sound speed and density. These values of $C_{\rm n}^2$ are much smaller than those inferred in the interstellar medium at similar physical scales. The resulting scattering delays from the hot CGM are negligible ($\ll1$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz), but are more detectable from the cool gas as either radio pulse broadening or scintillation, depending on the observing frequency and sightline geometry. Joint quasar-FRB observations of individual galaxies can yield lower limits on $l_{\rm i}$, even if the CGM is not a significant scattering site. An initial comparison between quasar and FRB observations (albeit for different systems) suggests $l_{\rm i}\gtrsim750$ km in $\sim10^4$ K gas in order for the quasar and FRB constraints to be consistent. If a foreground CGM is completely ruled out as a source of scattering along an FRB sightline then $l_{\rm i}$ may be comparable to the smallest cloud sizes ($\lesssim$ pc) inferred from photoionization modeling of quasar absorption lines.</description>

      <title>MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) -- III. The role of mergers and environment in AGN activity in dwarf galaxies</title>

Abstract: Investigating whether and how galaxy mergers affect black hole growth can be determinant for black hole-galaxy evolution models and, in particular, for understanding how early Universe seed black holes grew to become supermassive. However, while mergers have been observed to enhance the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and thus black hole growth in massive galaxies, it is yet not known how this relation and the role of the environment translates to dwarf galaxies (the most likely hosts of the early seed black holes), since there are scarce and mixed results in the literature. We want to assess the impact of galaxy mergers and the environment on AGN triggering in dwarf galaxies. We use a sample of 3280 dwarf galaxies with integral-field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey to study the AGN fraction throughout the merger process and how it is affected by the environment (characterized by galaxy isolation, being in a void, and group richness). We also compare the fraction of interacting galaxies in AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies. We find that dwarf galaxy mergers can ignite AGNs at separations below 20 kpc. The AGN fraction increases notoriously after the first pass and remains enhanced until the final stage. Despite this, mergers are not the dominant AGN triggering mechanism. We also find that the environment has a non-negligible impact on AGN activity in dwarf galaxies, as the AGN fraction increases when moving to lower density environments. These findings provide the most statistically robust constraints to date on the effects of dwarf galaxy mergers and environment on AGN activity and black hole growth.</description>

Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.</description>

      <title>FROST-CLUSTERS -- II. Massive stars, binaries and triples boost supermassive black hole seed formation in assembling star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics and stellar evolution to investigate this collisional assembly with the \bifrost{} code coupled to the \sevn{} stellar evolution module. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary and triple stars as well a high initial single star mass limit (450 $M_\odot$) on the hierarchical assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive ($M_\mathrm {cl}\sim10^6 M_\odot$, $N=1.8 \times 10^6$) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to $\sim$ 10) and masses (up to $10^4 M_\odot$) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at $\Gamma_\mathrm {tde}\sim 5 \times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ shortly after IMBH formation at $\sim 2$ Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as $M_\bullet \propto M_\mathrm{cl}$, $M_\bullet \propto \Sigma_\mathrm{h}^\mathrm{3/2}$ and $M_\bullet \propto \sigma^\mathrm{3}$. Our results suggest IMBH masses above $M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$ for the dense $z\sim10$ star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A Low Metallicity Massive Contact Binary Star System Candidate in WLM identified by Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM ($Z = 0.14 Z_{\odot}$). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars ($T_1=29800^{+2300}_{-1700}$ K, $M_1=16^{+2}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$, and $T_2=18000^{+5000}_{-5000}$ K, $M_2=7^{+5}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>

Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>
