      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of domains in a 3-dimensional warped product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A warped product with a spherical factor and a logarithmically concave warping function satisfies a scalar curvature rigidity of the Llarull type. We develop a scalar curvature rigidity of the Llarull type for a general class of domains in a three dimensional spherical warped product. In the presence of rotational symmetry, we identify this class of domains as those satisfying a boundary condition analogous to the logarithmic concavity of the warping function.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties and offset surface construction for slant timelike-ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates slant timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Minkowski 3-space $\mathbb{E}_{1}^{3}$. Using the symmetry of evolute curves, we derive a parametric formulation for skew timelike-ruled surfaces and establish conditions ensuring the coaxial alignment of the central normal with the ruling direction of the corresponding offset surface. The geometric properties are examined through the Blaschke and Darboux frames, leading to curvature characteristics and fundamental invariants. Special cases, such as timelike-developable and timelike-binormal surfaces, are analyzed with illustrative examples. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the differential geometry of timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Lorentzian space.</description>

      <title>Global hyperbolicity and manifold topology from the Lorentzian distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we seek characterizations of global hyperbolicity in smooth Lorentzian manifolds that do not rely on the manifold topology and that are inspired by metric geometry. In particular, strong causality is not assumed, so part of the problem is precisely that of recovering the manifold topology so as to make sense of it also in rough frameworks. After verifying that known standard characterizations do not meet this requirement, we propose two possible formulations. The first is based solely on chronological diamonds and is interesting due to its analogies with the Hopf-Rinow theorem. The second uses only properties of the Lorentzian distance function and it is suitable for extension to abstract `Lorentzian metric' frameworks. It turns out to be equivalent to the definition of `Lorentzian metric space' proposed in our previous joint work with S. Suhr, up to slightly strengthening weak $d$-distinction to `future or past $d$-distinction'. The role of a new property which we term `$d$-reflectivity' is also discussed. We then investigate continuity properties of the Lorentzian distance and the property of $d$-reflectivity in non-smooth frameworks. Finally, we establish a result of broader interest: the exponential map of a smooth spray is $C^{1,1}$ (smooth outside the zero section). Additionally, we derive a Lorentz-Finsler version of the Busemann-Mayer formula and demonstrate that, in strongly causal smooth Finsler spacetimes, the Finsler fundamental function can be reconstructed from the distance. As a consequence, distance-preserving bijections are shown to be Lorentz-Finsler isometries in the conventional smooth sense.</description>

      <title>Periodic Inscription of Isosceles Trapezoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a pair of continuous disjoint periodic curves in $\mathbb{C}$ inscribes an isosceles trapezoid with any similarity type. The case of smooth curves can be identified with a Lagrangian intersection problem for a pair of Lagrangian cylinders in $\mathbb{R}\times S^1\times\mathbb{C}$, and the continuous case follows from the smooth one by a standard convergence argument.</description>

      <title>A new Lagrangian approach to optimal control of second-order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and study a new approach to formulate the optimal control problem of second-order differential equations, with a particular interest in those derived from force-controlled Lagrangian systems. The formulation results in a new hyperregular control Langrangian and, thus, a new control Hamiltonian whose equations of motion provide necessary optimality conditions. We compare this approach to Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) in this setting, providing geometric insight into their relation. This leads us to define an extended Tulczyjew's triple with controls. Moreover, we study the relationship between Noether symmetries of this new formulation and those of the PMP.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Ricci flow and diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing and recognizing metrics can be extraordinarily difficult because of the group of diffeomorphisms. Two metrics, that could even be the same, could look completely different in different coordinates. This is the gauge problem. The general gauge problem is extremely subtle for non-compact spaces. Often it can be avoided if one uses some additional structure of the particular situation. However, in many problems there is no additional structure. Instead we solve the gauge problem directly in great generality.
  The techniques and ideas apply to many problems. We use them to solve a well-known open problem in Ricci flow: Strong rigidity of cylinders. Strong rigidity is an illustration of a {\it shrinker principle} that uniqueness radiates out from a compact set. It implies that if one tangent flow at a future singular point is a cylinder, then all tangent flows are.
  We solve the gauge problem by solving a nonlinear system of PDEs. The PDE produces a diffeomorphism that fixes an appropriate gauge in the spirit of the slice theorem for group actions. We then show optimal bounds for the displacement function of the diffeomorphism. Strong rigidity relies on gauge fixing and several other new ideas. One of these is "propagation of almost splitting", another is quadratic rigidity in the right gauge, and a third is an optimal polynomial growth bound for PDEs that holds in great generality.</description>

      <title>Genus one singularities in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for certain one-parameter families of initial conditions in $\mathbb R^3$, when we run mean curvature flow, a genus one singularity must appear in one of the flows. Moreover, such a singularity is robust under perturbation of the family of initial conditions. This contrasts sharply with the case of just a single flow. As an application, we construct an embedded, genus one self-shrinker with entropy lower than a shrinking doughnut.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give improved estimates for the size of the singular set of minimizing capillary hypersurfaces: the singular set is always of codimension at least $4$, and this estimate improves if the capillary angle is close to $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, or $\pi$. For capillary angles that are close to $0$ or $\pi$, our analysis is based on a rigorous connection between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli problem.</description>

      <title>Static Manifolds with Boundary and Rigidity of Scalar Curvature and Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a compact manifold with boundary, the map consisting of the scalar curvature in the interior and the mean curvature on the boundary is a local surjection at generic metrics. Moreover, this result may be localized to compact subdomains in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold with boundary. The non-generic case (also called non-generic domains) corresponds to static manifolds with boundary. We discuss their geometric properties, which also work as the necessary conditions of non-generic metrics. In space forms and the Schwarzschild manifold, we classify simple non-generic domains (with only one boundary component) and show their connection with rigidity theorems and the Schwarzschild photon sphere.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of left-invariant metrics on six-dimensional characteristically solvable nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A real Lie algebra is said to be characteristically solvable if its derivation algebra is solvable. We explicitly determine the moduli space of left-invariant metrics, up to isometric automorphism, for $6$-dimensional nilmanifolds whose associated Lie algebra is characteristically solvable of triangular type. We also compute the corresponding full isometry groups. For each left-invariant metric on these nilmanifolds we compute the index and distribution of symmetry. In particular, we find the first known examples of Lie groups which do not admit a left-invariant metric with positive index of symmetry. As an application we study the index of symmetry of nilsoliton metrics. We prove that nilsoliton metrics detect the existence of left-invariant metrics with positive index of symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a formula for the energy of a path in the moduli space of a compact $G_2$-manifold with vanishing first Betti number for the volume-normalised $L^2$-metric. This allows us to give simple sufficient conditions for a path of torsion-free $G_2$-structures to have finite energy and length. We deduce that the compact $G_2$-manifolds produced by the generalised Kummer construction have incomplete moduli spaces. Under some assumptions, we also state a necessary condition for the limit of a path of torsion-free $G_2$-structures to be at infinite distance in the moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05291v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how, under suitable assumptions, a K\"ahler test configuration admits a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, giving a corresponding expression for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant as a residue pairing. We study the general behaviour of such mirror formulae under large scaling of the K\"ahler form. We exploit the observation that this scaling trivially preserves $K$-stability, but takes the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model to a large complex structure limit. In certain cases the mirror formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant simplify in this limit. We focus on a special type of limiting behaviour, when the Donaldson-Futaki invariant concentrates at a single critical point of the Landau-Ginzburg potential, and show that this leads to new formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant in terms of theta functions on the mirror. We provide a main application, which shows that such limiting behaviour actually occurs for test configurations in several nontrivial examples, both toric and non-toric, in the case of slope (in)stability for polarised surfaces.</description>

      <title>Canonical normalizing flows for manifold learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manifold learning flows are a class of generative modelling techniques that assume a low-dimensional manifold description of the data. The embedding of such a manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via learnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly aligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the manifold and maximum likelihood can be used to optimize the network parameters. Naturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an injective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that the density aligns with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density volume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However, unless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold is not necessarily an efficient representation of the data. Namely, the latent dimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis, with degenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a locally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical intrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space representation. Toward this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow method, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix to have few prominent and non-degenerate basis functions. We demonstrate that by minimizing the off-diagonal manifold metric elements $\ell_1$-norm, we can achieve such a basis, which is simultaneously sparse and/or orthogonal. Canonical manifold flow yields a more efficient use of the latent space, automatically generating fewer prominent and distinct dimensions to represent data, and a better approximation of target distributions than other manifold flow methods in most experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores.</description>

Abstract: We give two proofs of the Kalman Theorem, alternative to the most common ones, which infer such a classical result of Control Theory using just very basic facts on flows of vector fields. These proofs are apt to be generalised in diverse directions -- in fact one of them has been already generalised, yielding new criteria for local controllability of non-linear real analytic controlled systems.</description>
