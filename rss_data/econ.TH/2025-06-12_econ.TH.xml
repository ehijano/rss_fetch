      <title>Competition Complexity in Multi-Item Auctions: Beyond VCG and Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the value of the monopoly's bargaining power in terms of competition complexity--that is, the number of additional bidders the monopoly must attract in simple auctions to match the expected revenue of the optimal mechanisms (c.f., Bulow and Klemperer, 1996, Eden et al., 2017)--within the setting of multi-item auctions. We show that for simple auctions that sell items separately, the competition complexity is $\Theta(\frac{n}{\alpha})$ in an environment with $n$ original bidders under the slightly stronger assumption of $\alpha$-strong regularity, in contrast to the standard regularity assumption in the literature, which requires $\Omega(n \cdot \ln \frac{m}{n})$ additional bidders (Feldman et al., 2018). This significantly reduces the value of learning the distribution to design the optimal mechanisms, especially in large markets with many items for sale. For simple auctions that sell items as a grand bundle, we establish a constant competition complexity bound in a single-bidder environment when the number of items is small or when the value distribution has a monotone hazard rate. Some of our competition complexity results also hold when we compete against the first best benchmark (i.e., optimal social welfare).</description>

      <title>Marginal Reputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study reputation formation where a long-run player repeatedly observes private signals and takes actions. Short-run players observe the long-run player's past actions but not her past signals. The long-run player can thus develop a reputation for playing a distribution over actions, but not necessarily for playing a particular mapping from signals to actions. Nonetheless, we show that the long-run player can secure her Stackelberg payoff if distinct commitment types are statistically distinguishable and the Stackelberg strategy is confound-defeating. This property holds if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is the unique solution to an optimal transport problem. If the long-run player's payoff is supermodular in one-dimensional signals and actions, she secures the Stackelberg payoff if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is monotone. Applications include deterrence, delegation, signaling, and persuasion. Our results extend to the case where distinct commitment types may be indistinguishable but the Stackelberg type is salient under the prior.</description>

      <title>Utility Maximization Under Endogenous Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a general existence result for expected utility maximization in settings where the agent's decision affects the uncertainty faced by her. We introduce a continuity condition for choice-dependent probability measures which ensures the upper semi-continuity of expected utility. Our topological proof imposes minimal restrictions on the utility function and the random variable. In particular, we do not need common assumptions like the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP) or the convexity of distribution functions condition (CDFC). Additionally, we identify sufficient conditions - continuity of densities and stochastic dominance - which help verify our assumptions in most practical applications. These findings expand the applicability of expected utility theory in settings with endogenous uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The (Mis)use of Information in Decentralised Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seller offers an asset in a decentralised market. Buyers have private signals about their common value. I study whether the market becomes allocatively more efficient with (i) more buyers, (ii) better-informed buyers. Both increase the information available about buyers' common value, but also the adverse selection each buyer faces. With more buyers, trade surplus eventually increases and converges to the full-information upper bound if and only if the likelihood ratios of buyers' signals are unbounded from above. Otherwise, it eventually decreases and converges to the no-information lower bound. With better information about trades buyers would have accepted, trade surplus increases. With better information about trades they would have rejected, trade surplus decreases--unless adverse selection is irrelevant. For binary signals, a sharper characterisation emerges: stronger good news increase total surplus, but stronger bad news eventually decrease it.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Monetary Ecosystems: Integrating Stablecoins and Fiat in the Future of Currency Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With market capitalization exceeding USD 200 billion as of early 2025, stablecoins have evolved from a crypto-focused innovation into a vital component of the global monetary structure. This paper identifies the characteristics of stablecoins from an analytical perspective and investigates the role of stablecoins in forming hybrid monetary ecosystems where public (fiat, CBDC) and private (USDC, USDT, DAI) monies coexist. Through econometric analysis with multiple models, we find that stablecoins maintain strong peg stability, while each type also exhibits distinctive responses to market variables such as trading volume and capitalization, depending on the mechanisms behind. We introduce a hybrid system design that proposes a two-layer structure where private stablecoin issuers are backed by central bank reserves, ensuring uniformity, security, and programmability. This model merges the advantages of decentralized finance and payment innovation while utilizing the Federal Reserve's institutional trust. A case study on the 2023 SVB-USDC depeg event illustrates how such a hybrid system could prevent panic-induced instability through transparent reserves, secured liquidity, and interoperable assets. Ultimately, this research examines the model using the Dybvig model and Monte Carlo Simulation and concludes, with the results of the examinations, that a hybrid monetary model not only enhances financial inclusivity, scalability, and dollar utility in digital ecosystems but also strengthens systemic resilience, offering a credible blueprint for future digital dollar architectures.</description>
