      <description>arXiv:2403.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the deep points of a cluster algebra; that is, the points in the associated variety which are not in any cluster torus. We describe the deep points of cluster algebras of type A, rank 2, Markov, and unpunctured surface type.</description>

      <title>HMS symmetries of toric boundary divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective crepant resolution of a Gorenstein affine toric variety and let $((\mathbb{C}^*)^k,f)$ be the LG-model which is the Hori-Vafa mirror dual of $X$. Let ${D}$ be a generic fiber of $f$ equipped with the restriction of the standard Liouville form on $(\mathbb{C}^*)^k$. Let $\mathcal{K}_A$ be the so-called "stringy K\"ahler moduli space" of $X$. We show that $\pi_1(\mathcal{K}_A)$ acts on the wrapped Fukaya category of $D$. Using results by Gammage - Shende and Zhou, this result implies that $\pi_1(\mathcal{K}_A)$ acts on $D^b(\operatorname{coh}(\partial X))$ where $\partial X$ is the toric boundary divisor of $X$. We show that the induced action of $\pi_1(\mathcal{K}_A)$ on $K_0(\operatorname{coh}(\partial X))$ may be extended in a natural way to an action on $K_0(X)$ which corresponds to a GKZ system.</description>

      <title>Maximal Number of Skew Lines in the Fermat Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Fermat surface of degree $d\geq 3$ has $3d^2$ lines. However, it has not yet been established what is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint lines that it can have if $d\geq 4$. In this article we show that the maximal number of skew lines on the Fermat surface of degree $d \geq 4$ is $3d$ either $d$ even or $d$ odd distinct of $5$, otherwise ($d = 5$) it contains no more than $13$ pairwise disjoint lines.</description>

      <title>Balancing properties of tropical moduli maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family of parameterized algebraic curves over a strictly semistable pair, we show that the simultaneous tropicalization of the curves in the family forms a family of parameterized tropical curves over the skeleton of the strictly semistable pair. We show that the induced tropical moduli map satisfies a certain balancing condition, which allows us to describe properties of its image and deduce a new liftability criterion.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Bundles with Symplectic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study harmonic bundles with an additional structure called symplectic structure. We study them for the case of the base manifold is compact and non-compact. For the compact case, we show that a harmonic bundle with a symplectic structure is equivalent to principle $Sp(2n,C)$-bundle with a reductive flat connection. For the non-compact case, we show that a polystable good filtered Higgs bundle with a perfect skew-symmetric pairing is equivalent to a good wild harmonic bundle with a symplectic structure.</description>

      <title>On Dynamical Systems in the \'Etale Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss $\mathcal{D}$-modules and dynamical systems in the \'etale topology. We introduce the differential scheme associated to a morphism $f: X\to S$ of schemes of the same dimension. We introduce differential inertia group $I_{diff}^i$ which act trivially on the special fibers of these schemes. As an application we discuss the problem of counting points on elliptic curves which we show is connected to vanishing cycles of singularities and to closed orbits of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology for affine superspaces A^(m,n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of Lie superalgebra of vector fields on affine super-spaces $\mathbb{A}^{m,n}$ with trivial coefficients. In this paper we extend the methodology developed in the previous paper (arXiv:2210.16585) to perform the calculation for arbitrary dimensions $(m, n)$ with $m \geq n$. This combined with previously known results for other dimensions $(m, n)$ fully settles the local problem of Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology with trivial coefficients for super-manifolds. As part of the proof we also compute the cohomology of Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{gl}(m,n)$ with coefficients given by Schur functors of the standard representation.</description>

      <title>Complex algebraic stacks and morphisms of intersection complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a construction of Barthel-Brasselet-Fieseler-Gabber-Kaup in the setting of complex varieties to the setting of finite type, complex algebraic stacks. Given two such stacks $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ with affine stabilizers, and a morphism between them, we construct a morphism from the pullback of the intersection complex of $\mathcal{Y}$ to the intersection complex of $\mathcal{X}$. As an application, we show that the Borel-Moore fundamental class of a closed substack $\mathcal{Z}$ in a Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathcal{X}$ lifts to a class in the intersection cohomology of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>

      <title>Matroids and semirings attached to toric singularity arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curve singularities are classical objects of study in algebraic geometry. The key player in their combinatorial structure is the {\it value semigroup}, or its compactification, the {\it value semiring}. One natural problem is to explicitly determine the value semirings of distinguished infinite classes of singularities, with a view to understanding their asymptotic properties. In this paper, we establish a matroidal framework for resolving this problem for singularities determined by arrangements of toric branches; and we obtain precise quantitative results in the case of line arrangements. Our results have implications for the topology of Severi varieties of unisingular rational curves in projective space.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsequent to the previous paper [Tak5], we are concerned with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations (possibly allowing some coordinates have weights $0$) are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds.
  The purpose of this paper is to give new constructions of a $14$-dimensional affine variety $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and a $15$-dimensional affine variety $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration, which were constructed and were shown to be key varieties in the papers [Tak3,Tak4] and [Tay]. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 9 and 10 parameters, respectively. The coordinatization with $9$ parameters is derived by using a fixed primitive idempotent, and the associated Peirce decomposition. The coordinatization with $10$ parameters is derived from the construction of a quadratic Jordan subalgebra generated by $\sharp$-products of two elements due to Petersson [Pe1].</description>

      <title>Linear Shafarevich Conjecture in positive characteristic, Hyperbolicity and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex quasi-projective normal variety $X$ and a linear representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_{N}(K)$ with $K$ any field of positive characteristic, we mainly establish the following results:
  1. the construction of the Shafarevich morphism ${\rm sh}_\varrho:X\to {\rm Sh}_\varrho(X)$ associated with $\varrho$.
  2. In cases where $X$ is projective, $\varrho$ is faithful and the $\Gamma$-dimension of $X$ is at most two (e.g. $\dim X=2$), we prove that the Shafarevich conjecture holds for $X$.
  3. In cases where $\varrho$ is big, we prove that the Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture holds for $X$.
  4. When $\varrho$ is big and the Zariski closure of $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is a semisimple algebraic group, we prove that $X$ is pseudo Picard hyperbolic, and strongly of log general type.
  5. If $X$ is special or $h$-special, then $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually abelian.
  We also prove Claudon-H\"oring-Koll\'ar's conjecture for complex projective manifolds with linear fundamental groups of any characteristic.</description>

      <title>On the effective generation of direct images of pluricanonical bundles in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective global generation result for direct images of pluricanonical bundles in mixed characteristic. This is a mixed characteristic analog of Ejiri's theorem in positive characteristic and the theorem of Popa and Schnell regarding their Fujita-type conjecture in characteristic zero. As an application, we establish a weak positivity statement for the relative canonical sheaf of a smooth morphism in mixed characteristic. Using this weak positivity result, we prove that images of Fano schemes under smooth morphisms are again Fano in mixed characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic residue patterns modulo a prime are studied since 19th century. In the first part we extend existing results on the number of consecutive $\ell$-tuples of quadratic residues, studying corresponding algebraic curves and their jacobians, which happen to be products of jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In the second part we state the last unpublished result of Lydia Goncharova on squares such that their differences are also squares, reformulate it in terms of algebraic geometry of a K3 surface, and prove it. The core of this theorem is an unexpected relation between the number of points on the K3 surface and that on a CM elliptic curve.</description>

Abstract: We study varieties $\mathcal{A}_n$ arising as equivariant compactifications of the space of $n$ points in $\mathbb{C}$ up to overall translation. We define $\mathcal{A}_n$ and examine its basic geometric properties before constructing an isomorphism to an augmented wonderful variety. We show that $\mathcal{A}_n$ is in a canonical way a resolution of the space $\overline{P}_n$ considered by Zahariuc, proving along the way that the resolution constructed by Zahariuc is equivalent to ours.</description>

The algorithm completely avoids polynomial system solving, and uses bivariate factoring, instead, as a fundamental tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the K-moduli space of Fano threefolds obtained by blowing up $\mathbb{P}^3$ along $(2,3)$-complete intersection curves. This K-moduli space is a two-step birational modification of the GIT moduli space of $(3,3)$-curves on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. As an application, we show that our K-moduli space appears as one model of the Hassett--Keel program for $\overline{M}_4$. In particular, we classify all K-(semi/poly)stable members in this deformation family of Fano varieties. We follow the moduli continuity method with moduli of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces, general elephants and Sarkisov links as new ingredients.</description>

      <title>Weak Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements with ordinary singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present note we focus on conic line arrangements in the plane with quasihomogeneous ordinary singularities from the perspective of weak Ziegler pairs. The foundations of this article come from an active area of research devoted to the freeness and nearly freeness of curve arrangements in the complex projective plane and the socalled Numerical Terao s Conjecture. This conjecture boils down to a very fundamental problem in combinatorial algebraic geometry, namely whether the weak combinatorics of a given arrangement determines the freeness.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of Ulrich modules over Cohen-Macaulay local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, the minimal number of generators of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay module is bounded above by its multiplicity. In 1984 Ulrich asked whether there always exist modules for which equality holds; such modules are known nowadays as Ulrich modules. We answer this question in the negative by constructing families of two dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings that have no Ulrich modules. Some of these examples are Gorenstein normal domains; others are even complete intersection domains, though not normal.</description>

      <title>The smooth Mordell-Weil group and mapping class groups of elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the Mordell-Weil Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove a smooth version of the Mordell-Weil Theorem and apply it to the `unipotent radical' case of a Thurston-type classification of mapping classes of simply-connected $4$-manifolds $M_d$ that admit the structure of an elliptic complex surface of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$. Applications include Nielsen realization theorems for $M_d$.
  By combining this with known results, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: if the singular fibers of such an elliptic fibration are of the simplest (i.e.\ nodal) type, then the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. In particular, any diffeomorphism of $M_d,d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</description>

      <title>The cone conjecture for vector-valued Siegel automorphic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the effective cone of automorphic vector bundles on the Siegel modular variety of rank $n$ in characteristic $p$ at a place of good reduction is encoded by the stack of $G$-zips of Pink--Wedhorn--Ziegler. Specifically, we show that the degree zero cohomology groups of automorphic vector bundles always vanish outside of the zip cone. This result is a special case of a general conjecture formulated by the Goldring and the author for all Hodge-type Shimura varieties of good reduction. In the case $n=3$, we give explicit conditions for the vanishing of the $0$-th cohomology group. Finally, in the course of the proof we define the notion of automorphic forms of trivial-type and study their properties.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies Frequency-Difference-of-Arrival (FDOA) curves for the 2-dimensional, 2-sensor case. The primary focus of this paper is to give a description of curves associated to the FDOA problem from the algebro-geometric point of view. To be more precise, the complex projective picture of the family of FDOA curves for all possible relative velocities is described.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is a convex cone defined by a finite number of linear inequalities. For this, we prove that the set of all $c_1(\mathcal{S})$ for $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{E}$ saturated and coherent is finite.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Constraints on Common Lines with Applications to Community Detection in Cryo-EM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the topic of common lines between 2D class averages in single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We derive a novel low-rank constraint on a certain $2n \times n$ matrix storing properly-scaled basis vectors for the common lines between $n$ tomographic images of one molecular conformation. Using this constraint and others, we introduce an optimization algorithm to denoise the common lines of one conformation. As a main application, we develop a clustering algorithm to partition a set of noisy common lines into homogeneous communities, in the case of discrete heterogeneity in cryo-EM. We demonstrate the methods on synthetic and experimental datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in two different ways, Hurwitz numbers and quantum curves. The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow C$ be a dominant morphism between smooth irreducible varieties over a finitely generated field $k$ such that the generic fiber $X$ is smooth, projective and geometrically connected. Assuming that $C$ is a curve with function field $K$, we build a relation between the Tate-Shafarevich group for $\mathrm{Pic}^0_{X/K}$ and the geometric Brauer groups for $\mathcal{X}$ and $X$, generalizing a theorem of Artin and Grothendieck for fibered surfaces to arbitrary relative dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give some conditions on a family of abelian covers of ${\mathbb P}^1$ of genus $g$ curves, that ensure that the family yields a subvariety of ${\mathsf A}_g$ which is not totally geodesic, hence it is not Shimura. As a consequence, we show that for any abelian group $G$, there exists an integer $M$ which only depends on $G$ such that if $g &gt;M$, then the family yields a subvariety of ${\mathsf A}_g$ which is not totally geodesic. We prove then analogous results for families of abelian covers of ${\tilde C}_t \rightarrow {\mathbb P}^1 = {\tilde C}_t/{\tilde G}$ with an abelian Galois group ${\tilde G}$ of even order, proving that under some conditions, if $\sigma \in {\tilde G}$ is an involution, the family of Pryms associated with the covers ${\tilde C}_t \rightarrow C_t= {\tilde C}_t/\langle \sigma \rangle$ yields a subvariety of ${\mathsf A}_{p}^{\delta}$ which is not totally geodesic. As a consequence, we show that if ${\tilde G} =({\mathbb Z}/N{\mathbb Z})^m$ with $N$ even, and $\sigma$ is an involution in ${\tilde G}$, there exists an integer $M(N)$ which only depends on $N$ such that, if ${\tilde g} = g({\tilde C}_t) &gt; M(N)$, then the subvariety of the Prym locus in ${\mathsf A}^{\delta}_{p}$ induced by any such family is not totally geodesic (hence it is not Shimura).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Buch and Mihalcea in the case of the incidence variety X=Fl(1,n-1;n) and determine the structure of its (T-equivariant) quantum K-theory ring. Our results are an interplay between geometry and combinatorics. The geometric side concerns Gromov-Witten varieties of 3-pointed genus 0 stable maps to X with markings sent to Schubert varieties, while on the combinatorial side are formulas for the (equivariant) quantum K-theory ring of X. We prove that the Gromov-Witten variety is rationally connected when one of the defining Schubert varieties is a divisor and another is a point. This implies that the (equivariant) K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants defined by two Schubert classes and a Schubert divisor class can be computed in the ordinary (equivariant) K-theory ring of X. We derive a positive Chevalley formula for the equivariant quantum K-theory ring of X and a positive Littlewood-Richardson rule for the non-equivariant quantum K-theory ring of X. The Littlewood-Richardson rule in turn implies that non-empty Gromov-Witten varieties given by Schubert varieties in general position have arithmetic genus 0.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be either a general hypersurface of degree $n+1$ in $\mathbb P^n$ or a general $(2,n)$ complete intersection in $\mathbb P^{n+1}, n\geq 4$. We construct balanced rational curves on $X$ of all high enough degrees. If $n=3$ or $g=1$, we construct rigid curves of genus $g$ on $X$ of all high enough degrees. As an application we construct some rigid bundles on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In addition, we construct some low-degree balanced rational curves on hypersurfaces of degree $n + 2$ in $\mathbb P^n$.</description>

Abstract: We define a notion of Hodge modules with rational singularities. A variety has rational singularities in the usual sense, if it is normal and the Hodge module related to intersection cohomology has rational singularities in the present sense. Our main result is a generalization of Boutot's theorem that if a reductive group acts on an affine variety with a stable point, and $H$ is an equivariant Hodge module with rational singularities, then the induced module on the GIT quotient also has rational singularities.</description>

Abstract: We prove non-hyperbolicity of primitive symplectic varieties with $b_2 \geq 5$ that satisfy the rational SYZ conjecture. If in addition $b_2 \geq 7$, we establish that the Kobayashi pseudometric vanishes identically. This in particular applies to all currently known examples of irreducible symplectic manifolds and thereby completes the results by Kamenova--Lu--Verbitsky. The key new contribution is that a projective primitive symplectic variety with a Lagrangian fibration has vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric. The proof uses ergodicity, birational contractions, and cycle spaces.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of motives with compact support for logarithmic schemes over a field. Starting from the notion of finite logarithmic correspondences with compact support, we define the logarithmic motive with compact support analogous to the classical case for schemes. We then establish an analog of a Gysin sequence and, assuming resolution of singularities, a K{\"u}nneth formula. This implies that our theory is $\overline{\square}$-invariant, which presents a critical feature that is absent in the classical case. Further assuming resolution of singularities, we prove a duality theorem for log schemes which we use to establish a cancellation theorem for log schemes whose underlying scheme is proper. Moreover, we discuss new homology and cohomology theories for log smooth fs logarithmic schemes based on our results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, for each $d&gt;0$, we study the minimum integer $h_{3,2d}\in \mathbb{N}$ for which there exists a complex polarized K3 surface $(X,H)$ of degree $H^2=2d$ and Picard number $\rho (X):=\textrm{rank } \textrm{Pic } X = h_{3,2d}$ admitting an automorphism of order $3$. We show that $h_{3,2}\in\{ 4,6\}$ and $h_{3,2d}=2$ for $d&gt;1$. Analogously, we study the minimum integer $h^*_{3,2d}\in \mathbb{N}$ for which there exists a complex polarized K3 surface $(X,H)$ as above plus the extra condition that the automorphism acts as the identity on the Picard lattice of $X$. We show that $h^*_{3,2d}$ is equal to $2$ if $d&gt;1$ and equal to $6$ if $d=1$. We provide explicit examples of K3 surfaces defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ realizing these bounds.</description>

In particular, $G$ is not necessary abelian. Assume further that $G$ contains the grading operator $j_f$ and $f$ satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition. We prove that the nonvanishing bigraded pieces of the B-model state space of $(f,G)$ form a diamond. We identify its topmost, bottommost, leftmost and rightmost entries as one-dimensional and show that this diamond enjoys the essential horizontal and vertical isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>A question about generalized nonvanishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a projective, $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial log canonical pair and let $L$ be a pseudoeffective $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor on $X$ such that $K_X + \Delta + L$ is pseudoeffective. Is there an effective $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor $M$ on $X$ such that $K_X + \Delta + L$ is numerically equivalent to $M$? We are not aware of any counterexamples, but the answer is not completely clear even in the case of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Tautological projection for cycles on the moduli space of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a tautological projection operator for algebraic cycle classes on the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties $\mathcal{A}_g$: every cycle class decomposes canonically as a sum of a tautological and a non-tautological part. The main new result required for the definition of the projection operator is the vanishing of the top Chern class of the Hodge bundle over the boundary $\bar{\mathcal{A}}_g\smallsetminus \mathcal{A}_g$ of any toroidal compactification $\bar{\mathcal{A}}_g$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$. We prove the vanishing by a careful study of residues in the boundary geometry.
  The existence of the projection operator raises many natural questions about cycles on $\mathcal{A}_g$. We calculate the projections of all product cycles $\mathcal{A}_{g_1}\times \ldots \times \mathcal{A}_{g_\ell}$ in terms of Schur determinants, discuss Faber's earlier calculations related to the Torelli locus, and state several open questions. The Appendix contains a conjecture about the projection of the locus of abelian varieties with real multiplication.</description>

      <title>Virasoro constraints and representations for quiver moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Virasoro constraints for moduli spaces of representations of quiver with relations by Joyce's vertex algebras. Using the framed Virasoro constraints, we construct a representation of half of the Virasoro algebra on the cohomology of moduli stacks of quiver representations under smoothness assumption. By exploiting the non-commutative nature of the Virasoro operators, we apply our theory for quivers to del Pezzo surfaces using exceptional collections. In particular, the Virasoro constraints and representations are proven for moduli of sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ and $\text{Bl}_{\mathsf{pt}}(\mathbb{P}^2)$. Lastly, we unravel the Virasoro constraints for Grassmannians in terms of symmetric polynomials and Hecke operators.</description>

      <title>Quantization of classical spectral curves via topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.04339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the topological recursion formalism can be used to quantize any generic classical spectral curve with smooth ramification points and simply ramified away from poles. For this purpose, we build both the associated quantum curve, i.e.~the differential operator quantizing the algebraic equation defining the classical spectral curve considered, and a basis of wave functions, that is to say a basis of solutions of the corresponding differential equation. We further build a Lax pair representing the resulting quantum curve and thus present it as a point in an associated space of meromorphic connections on the Riemann sphere, a first step towards isomonodromic deformations. We finally propose two examples: the derivation of a 2-parameter family of formal trans-series solutions to Painlev\'e 2 equation and the quantization of a degree three spectral curve with pole only at infinity.</description>

      <title>Symplectomorphisms of some Weinstein 4-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let M be a Weinstein four-manifold mirror to Y\D for (Y,D) a log Calabi--Yau surface; intuitively, this is typically the Milnor fibre of a smoothing of a cusp singularity. We introduce two families of symplectomorphisms of M: Lagrangian translations, which we prove are mirror to tensors with line bundles; and nodal slide recombinations, which we prove are mirror to automorphisms of (Y,D). The proof uses a detailed compatibility between the homological and SYZ view-points on mirror symmetry. Together with spherical twists, these symplectomorphisms are expected to generate all autoequivalences of the wrapped Fukaya category of M which are compactly supported in a categorical sense. A range of applications is given.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove the boundedness of minimal slopes of adelic line bundles over function fields of characteristic 0. This can be applied to prove the equidistribution of generic and small points with respect to a big and semipositive adelic line bundle. Our methods can be applied to the finite places of number fields as well. We also show the continuity of $\chi$-volumes over function fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cominuscule flag varieties generalize Grassmannians to other Lie types. Schubert varieties in cominuscule flag varieties are indexed by posets of roots labeled long/short. These labeled posets generalize Young diagrams. We prove that Schubert varieties in potentially different cominuscule flag varieties are isomorphic as varieties if and only if their corresponding labeled posets are isomorphic, generalizing the classification of Grassmannian Schubert varieties using Young diagrams by the last two authors. Our proof is type-independent.</description>

      <title>Tilted biorthogonal ensembles, Grothendieck random partitions, and determinantal tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study probability measures on partitions based on symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. These deformations of Schur polynomials introduced in the K-theory of Grassmannians share many common properties. Our Grothendieck measures are analogs of the Schur measures on partitions introduced by Okounkov (arXiv:math/9907127 [math.RT]). Despite the similarity of determinantal formulas for the probability weights of Schur and Grothendieck measures, we demonstrate that Grothendieck measures are \emph{not} determinantal point processes. This question is related to the principal minor assignment problem in algebraic geometry, and we employ a determinantal test first obtained by Nanson in 1897 for the $4\times4$ problem. We also propose a procedure for getting Nanson-like determinantal tests for matrices of any size $n\ge4$ which appear new for $n\ge 5$.
  By placing the Grothendieck measures into a new framework of tilted biorthogonal ensembles generalizing a rich class of determinantal processes introduced by Borodin (arXiv:math/9804027 [math.CA]), we identify Grothendieck random partitions as a cross-section of a Schur process, a determinantal process in two dimensions. This identification expresses the correlation functions of Grothendieck measures through sums of Fredholm determinants, which are not immediately suitable for asymptotic analysis. A more direct approach allows us to obtain a limit shape result for the Grothendieck random partitions. The limit shape curve is not particularly explicit as it arises as a cross-section of the limit shape surface for the Schur process. The gradient of this surface is expressed through the argument of a complex root of a cubic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we define a series of associative algebras attached to a vertex operator algebra $V$, called mode transition algebras, showing they reflect both algebraic properties of $V$ and geometric constructions on moduli of curves. One can define sheaves of coinvariants on pointed coordinatized curves from $V$-modules. We show that if the mode transition algebras admit multiplicative identities with certain properties, these sheaves deform as wanted on families of curves with nodes (so $V$ satisfies smoothing). Consequently, coherent sheaves of coinvariants defined by vertex operator algebras that satisfy smoothing form vector bundles. We also show that mode transition algebras give information about higher level Zhu algebras and generalized Verma modules. As an application, we completely describe higher level Zhu algebras of the Heisenberg vertex algebra for all levels, proving a conjecture of Addabbo--Barron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver $\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra. Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of scalars.</description>

      <title>Explicit expressions for the gamma vector leading to connections to upper/lower bounds and structural properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an explicit formula for the gamma vector in terms of the input polynomial in a way that extends it to arbitrary polynomials. More specifically, we find explicit linear combination in terms of coefficients of the input polynomial (using Catalan numbers and binomial coefficients) and an expression involving the derivative of the input polynomial. The first expression suggests connections to common Coxeter group/noncrossing partition structures in existing gamma positivity examples. In the case where the input is the $h$-polynomial of a simplicial complex, this gives an interpretation of the gamma vector as a measure of differences in local and global contributions. We also apply them to connect signs/inequalities of (shifts of) the gamma vector to upper/lower bound conditions on coefficients of the input polynomial. Finally, we make use of the shape of the sums used to make these estimates and connections with intersection numbers to relate these properties of the gamma vector to algebraic structures (e.g. characteristic classes involved in existing log concavity and Schur positivity properties).</description>
