      <title>MyESL: Sparse learning in molecular evolution and phylogenetic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary sparse learning (ESL) uses a supervised machine learning approach, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), to build models explaining the relationship between a hypothesis and the variation across genomic features (e.g., sites) in sequence alignments. ESL employs sparsity between and within the groups of genomic features (e.g., genomic loci) by using sparse-group LASSO. Although some software packages are available for performing sparse group LASSO, we found them less well-suited for processing and analyzing genome-scale data containing millions of features, such as bases. MyESL software fills the need for open-source software for conducting ESL analyses with facilities to pre-process the input hypotheses and large alignments, make LASSO flexible and computationally efficient, and post-process the output model to produce different metrics useful in functional or evolutionary genomics. MyESL can take phylogenetic trees and sequence alignments as input and transform them into numeric responses and features, respecetively. The model outputs are processed into user-friendly text and graphical files. The computational core of MyESL is written in C++, which offers model building with or without group sparsity, while the pre- and post-processing of inputs and model outputs is performed using customized functions written in Python. One of its applications in phylogenomics showcases the utility of MyESL. Our analysis of empirical genome-scale datasets shows that MyESL can build evolutionary models quickly and efficiently on a personal desktop, while other computational packages were unable due to their prohibitive requirements of computational resources and time. MyESL is available for Python environments on Linux and distributed as a standalone application for Windows and macOS. It is available from https://github.com/kumarlabgit/MyESL.</description>

      <title>Control of Overpopulated Tails in Kinetic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a bounded habitat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a nonlocal version of the Fisher-KPP equation, we explore the impact of heterogeneous diffusion on pattern formation within a bounded region (refuge). Under homogeneous diffusion, it is established that, nonlocality can lead to spontaneous pattern formation under certain parameter conditions, otherwise, when the homogeneous state is stable, spatial perturbations such as the existence of a refuge (high quality region within a hostile environment) can induce patterns. To understand how density-dependent diffusivity influences these forms of pattern formation, we examine diffusivity reactions to both rarefaction or overcrowding. Additionally, for comparison, we investigate the scenario where diffusivity levels vary spatially, inside and outside the refuge. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of patterns, potentially triggering either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion responses to density changes.</description>

      <title>A model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection transmission in human with latent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, we have derived a mathematical model for within human dynamics of COVID-19 infection using delay differential equations. The new model considers a 'latent period' and 'the time for immune response' as delay parameters, allowing us to study the effects of time delays in human COVID-19 infection. We have determined the equilibrium points and analyzed their stability. The disease-free equilibrium is stable when the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is below unity. Stability switch of the endemic equilibrium occurs through Hopf-bifurcation. This study shows that the effect of latent delay is stabilizing whereas immune response delay has a destabilizing nature.</description>

      <title>Fractional modelling of COVID-19 transmission incorporating asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, necessitating effective modelling approaches to understand and control its transmission dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals in a single compartmental model. We highlight the advantages of utilizing incommensurate fractional order derivatives in ordinary differential equations, including increased flexibility in capturing disease dynamics and refined memory effects in the transmission process. We conduct a qualitative analysis of our proposed model, which involves determining the basic reproduction number and analysing the disease-free equilibrium's stability. By fitting the proposed model with real data from Portugal and comparing it with existing models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of supplementary population classes and fractional derivatives significantly improves the model's goodness of fit. Sensitivity analysis further provides valuable insights for designing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.</description>
