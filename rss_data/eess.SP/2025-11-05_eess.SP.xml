      <title>DiffPace: Diffusion-based Plug-and-play Augmented Channel Estimation in mmWave and Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures, leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach, it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method. Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance, attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Affordable EEG, Actionable Insights: An Open Dataset and Evaluation Framework for Epilepsy Patient Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to clinical multi-channel EEG remains limited in many regions worldwide. We present NEUROSKY-EPI, the first open dataset of single-channel, consumer-grade EEG for epilepsy, collected in a South Asian clinical setting along with rich contextual metadata. To explore its utility, we introduce EmbedCluster, a patient-stratification pipeline that transfers representations from EEGNet models trained on clinical data and enriches them with contextual autoencoder embeddings, followed by unsupervised clustering of patients based on EEG patterns. Results show that low-cost, single-channel data can support meaningful stratification. Beyond algorithmic performance, we emphasize human-centered concerns such as deployability in resource-constrained environments, interpretability for non-specialists, and safeguards for privacy, inclusivity, and bias. By releasing the dataset and code, we aim to catalyze interdisciplinary research across health technology, human-computer interaction, and machine learning, advancing the goal of affordable and actionable EEG-based epilepsy care.</description>

      <title>Design of an M-ary Chaos Shift Keying System Using Combined Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional chaos shift keying (CSK) communication systems, implementing chaotic synchronization techniques is costly but practically unattainable in a noisy environment. This paper proposes a combined chaotic sequences-based $M$-ary CSK (CCS-$M$-CSK) system that eliminates the need for chaotic synchronization. At the transmitter, the chaotic sequence is constructed by combining two chaotic segments of different lengths, where each is generated from distinct chaotic systems and only one kind of chaotic segment modulates the information signal. At the receiver, a deep learning unit with binary classification is meticulously designed to recover information symbols. The symbol error rate (SER) performance of the proposed system is evaluated over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Specifically, the impact of varying misalignment lengths on the SER performance of the system is analyzed when the received sequence is misaligned. Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrates significant performance advantages over existing CSK-based systems in multipath Rayleigh fading channels. These features establish CCS-$M$-CSK as a promising candidate for various applications, including Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X).</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Road Grade Preview Signals from Lidar and Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road grade can impact the energy efficiency, safety, and comfort associated with automated vehicle control systems. Currently, control systems that attempt to compensate for road grade are designed with one of two assumptions. Either the grade is only known once the vehicle is driving over the road segment through proprioception, or complete knowledge of the oncoming road grade is known from a pre-made map. Both assumptions limit the performance of a control system, as not having a preview signal prevents proactive grade compensation, whereas relying only on map data potentially subjects the control system to missing or outdated information. These limits can be avoided by measuring the oncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use point returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint along a path. The estimated grade is defined as the difference in height between the front and rear wheelbase at a given waypoint. Kalman filtering techniques are used to mitigate the effects of odometry and motion uncertainty on the grade estimates. This estimator's performance is compared to the measurements of a map created with a GNSS/INS system via a field experiment. When compared to the map-based system, the lidar-based estimator produces an unbiased error with a standard deviation of 0.6 degrees at an average range of 52.7 meters. By having similar precision to map-based systems, automotive lidar-based grade estimation systems are shown to be a valid approach for measuring road grade when a map is unavailable or inaccurate. In using lidar as an input signal for grade-based control system tasks, autonomous vehicles achieve higher redundancy and independence in contrast to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-flow Routing in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), where devices with diverse communication technologies coexist, there is increasing demand for efficient and adaptive multi-hop routing with multiple data flows. Traditional routing methods, designed for homogeneous environments, fail to address the complexity introduced by links consisting of multiple technologies, frequency-dependent fading, and dynamic topology changes. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing framework using deep Q-networks (DQN) to establish routes between multiple source-destination pairs in HWNs by enabling each node to jointly select a communication technology, a subband, and a next hop relay that maximizes the rate of the route. Our approach incorporates channel and interference-aware neighbor selection approaches to improve decision-making beyond conventional distance-based heuristics. We further evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method under varying network dynamics, including node mobility, changes in node density, and the number of data flows. Simulation results demonstrate that our DRL-based routing framework significantly enhances scalability, adaptability, and end-to-end throughput in complex HWN scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communications (MC) is an emerging research paradigm that utilizes molecules to transmit information, with promising applications in biomedicine such as targeted drug delivery or tumor detection. It is also envisioned as a key enabler of the Internet of BioNanoThings (IoBNT). In this paper, we propose algorithms based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for the estimation of communication channel parameters in MC systems. We focus on a simple branched topology, simulating the molecule movement with a macroscopic MC simulator. The Deep Learning architectures proposed for distance estimation demonstrate strong performance within these branched environments, highlighting their potential for future MC applications.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Plot and Change Quantile-based Deep Supervised and Semi-supervised Protection for Transmission Lines Connected to Photovoltaic Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional relays encounter difficulties in protecting transmission lines (TLs) connected to converter-based energy sources (CBESs) due to the influence of power electronics on fault characteristics. This article proposes a single-ended intelligent protection method for the TL segment between the grid and a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach utilizes a Recurrence Matrix and an InceptionTime-based system to identify faults by using the mean change in quantiles of 3-phase currents. It determines the fault position and identifies the faulty phase. ReliefF feature selection is applied to extract the optimal quantile features. The scheme's performance is assessed under abnormal conditions, including faults and capacitor and load-switching events, simulated in Power Systems Computer Aided Design / Electromagnetic Transients Program (PSCAD/EMTDC) on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system, with various fault and switching parameters. The scheme is also validated on the New England IEEE 39-bus system and in presence of partially rated converters. Additionally, the validation of the proposed strategy takes into account various conditions, including double-circuit line configuration, noise, series compensation, high-impedance faults, current transformer (CT) saturation, evolving and cross-country faults, remote and local faults, as well as variations in PV capacity, sampling frequency, and data window size. To address label scarcity and improve generalization, semi-supervised learning paradigms including label spreading, label propagation, and self-training are integrated with the InceptionTime framework, enabling near-supervised performance with limited annotated fault data. The results demonstrate that the approach is effective in handling different system configurations and conditions, ensuring the protection of TLs connected to large PV plants.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Detection of Mixed-Molecule Concentrations in Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a promising paradigm for applications where traditional electromagnetic communications are impractical. However, decoding chemical signals, especially in multi-transmitter systems, remains a key challenge due to interference and complex propagation dynamics. In this paper, we develop a one-dimensional fractal convolutional neural network (fCNN) to detect the concentrations of multiple types of molecules based on the absorbance spectra measured at a receiver. Our model is trained by both experimental and simulated datasets, with the latter enhanced by noise modeling to mimic real-world measurements. We demonstrate that a noiseaugmented simulated dataset can effectively be a substitute for experimental data, achieving similar decoding accuracy. Our approach successfully detects bit sequences in both binary and quadruple concentration shift keying (BCSK and QCSK) scenarios, even when transmitters are desynchronized, highlighting the potential of machine learning for robust MC signal detection.</description>

      <title>DL-Based Beam Management for mmWave Vehicular Networks Exploring Temporal Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave communications are essential for modern wireless networks. It supports high data rates but suffers from severe path loss, which requires precise beam alignment to maintain reliable links. This beam management is particularly challenging in highly dynamic scenarios such as vehicle-to-infrastructure, and several methods have been presented. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based beam tracking framework that combines a position-aware beam pre-selection strategy with sequential prediction using recurrent neural networks. The proposed architecture can support deep learning models trained for both classification and regression. In contrast to many existing studies that evaluate beam tracking under predominantly line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, our work explicitly includes highly challenging non-LOS scenarios - with up to 50% non-LOS incidence in certain datasets - to rigorously assess model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high top-K accuracy, even under adverse conditions, while reducing the beam measurement overhead by up to 50%.</description>

      <title>LLM4PG: Adapting Large Language Model for Pathloss Map Generation via Synesthesia of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel large language model (LLM)-based pathloss map generation model, termed LLM4PG, is proposed for sixth-generation (6G) AI-native communication systems via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To explore the mapping mechanism between sensing images and pathloss maps, a new synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset, SynthSoM-U2G, is constructed, covering multiple scenarios, frequency bands, and flight altitudes. By adapting the LLM for cross-modal pathloss map generation for the first time, LLM4PG establishes an effective cross-domain alignment between the multi-modal sensing-communication and natural language domains. A task-specific fine-tuning strategy with a tailored layer selection and activation scheme is designed to meet the demands of massive-scale, high-quality generation. Compared with conventional deep learning artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) models, LLM4PG achieves more accurate pathloss map generation and stronger generalization across diverse conditions. Results show that LLM4PG attains an NMSE of 0.0454, outperforming the conventional AIGC model by over 2.90 dB, while its cross-condition generalization achieves an NMSE of 0.0492, exceeding the baseline by 4.52 dB.</description>

      <title>A Kullback-Leibler divergence method for input-system-state identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compressed Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine (IF-TEM) is a power-efficient asynchronous sampler that converts analog signals into non-uniform time-domain samples. Adaptive IF-TEM (AIF-TEM) improves this machine by adapting its process to the characteristics of the input signal, thereby reducing the sampling rate. Compressed IF-TEM (CIF-TEM) reduces bit usage by performing analog compression before quantization. In this paper, we introduce a combined Adaptive Compressed IF-TEM (ACIF-TEM) -- a new sampler that leverages the two machines, AIF-TEM and CIF-TEM, where each reinforces the effectiveness of the other. We propose an efficient adaptive clockless time-to-digital converter (TDC) architecture for the novel sampler that integrates the compression stage within the TDC, facilitating the realization of the intended integrated system. \ifconf \else We analyze the total bit usage, and contrast its performance with that of IF-TEM, AIF-TEM, and CIF-TEM.\fi Via an evaluation study, we demonstrate that the proposed ACIF-TEM sampler achieves lower Mean Square Error (MSE) with fewer bits, offering compression gains of at least 3-bit out of 9-bits over AIF-TEM and 60\% compression over IF-TEM, for fixed recovery MSE with real audio signals.</description>

      <title>Investigating Brain Connectivity and Information Flow in Mental Workload Using EEG and fNIRS Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates brain connectivity and information flow during mental workload (MWL) by integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. Utilizing the N-back task to induce varying levels of MWL in 26 participants, we analyzed both functional and effective connectivity across 25 cortical regions derived from combined EEG and fNIRS signals. Functional connectivity was assessed using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Phase Locking Value (PLV), and Magnitude Squared Coherence (MSC), while effective connectivity was evaluated using directed Directed Transfer Function (dDTF) and generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Our findings reveal increased functional connectivity in frontal regions during higher MWL conditions (3-back compared to 0-back). Furthermore, effective connectivity analysis demonstrates a significant directional information flow from EEG to fNIRS, indicating a dominant influence of neural activity on hemodynamic responses. Statistical tests confirm significant differences in connectivity patterns between low and high MWL states. These results underscore the utility of EEG-fNIRS integration for characterizing brain network dynamics under varying cognitive demands and provide insights into neurovascular coupling mechanisms during mental workload.</description>

It implies a need to reassess or reinterpret established theories and tools, highlighting the tension between data-driven and model-based approaches. This paper calls for preserving valuable insights from classical signal processing while exploring how they can coexist or integrate with emerging AI methods.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted 3D Spherical Splatting for Object Composition Visualization using Detection Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02573v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability, this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features. Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.</description>

      <title>RL-Aided Cognitive ISAC: Robust Detection and Sensing-Communication Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Short Blocks, Fast Sensing: Finite Blocklength Tradeoffs in RIS-Assisted ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance, achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.</description>

      <title>Eye Movement Analysis in Simulated Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates eye movement behaviour during three conditions: Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated drive under reduced visibility). Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31 parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the analysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between Baseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or Fog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of 13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index (GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the BCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye movement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other parameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of saccades: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and standard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring the influence of reduced visibility on visual attention. Overall, these findings demonstrate that combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability, while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying visibility conditions.</description>

      <title>An unscented Kalman filter method for real time input-parameter-state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input. Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters, and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.</description>

      <title>A Non-Uniform Quantization Framework for Time-Encoding Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time encoding machines (TEMs) provide an event-driven alternative to classical uniform sampling, enabling power-efficient representations without a global clock. While prior work analyzed uniform quantization (UQ) of firing intervals, we show that these intervals are inherently non-uniformly distributed, motivating the use of non-uniform quantization (NUQ). We derive the probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited signals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution. Simulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same bit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both amplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves lower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the advantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.</description>

      <title>Condition-Invariant fMRI Decoding of Speech Intelligibility with Deep State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Heart Disease Prediction via a Weighted Ensemble Model: A Large-Scale Study with SHAP and Surrogate Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern, demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of 0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of 80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Beam Misalignment Effect in Inter-Satellite FSO Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising technology for inter-satellite links (ISLs) due to its high data rate, low power consumption, and reduced interference. However, the performance of inter-satellite FSO systems is highly sensitive to beam misalignment. While pointing-ahead angle (PAA) compensation is commonly employed, the effectiveness of PAA compensation depends on precise orbital knowledge and advanced alignment hardware, which are not always feasible in practice. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the impact of beam misalignment on inter-satellite FSO communication. We derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the FSO channel under the joint jitter and misalignment-induced pointing error, and introduce a truncated CDF formulation with a bisection algorithm to efficiently compute outage probabilities with guaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead. To make the analysis more practical, we quantify displacement based on orbital dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo simulations, making the proposed model highly useful to design inter-satellite FSO systems in practice.</description>

      <title>From the perspective of perceptual speech quality: The robustness of frequency bands to noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality is one of the main foci of speech-related research, where it is frequently studied with speech intelligibility, another essential measurement. Band-level perceptual speech intelligibility, however, has been studied frequently, whereas speech quality has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this paper, a Multiple Stimuli With Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) inspired approach was proposed to study the individual robustness of frequency bands to noise with perceptual speech quality as the measure. Speech signals were filtered into thirty-two frequency bands with compromising real-world noise employed at different signal-to-noise ratios. Robustness to noise indices of individual frequency bands was calculated based on the human-rated perceptual quality scores assigned to the reconstructed noisy speech signals. Trends in the results suggest the mid-frequency region appeared less robust to noise in terms of perceptual speech quality. These findings suggest future research aiming at improving speech quality should pay more attention to the mid-frequency region of the speech signals accordingly.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of NOMA-Assisted Optical OFDM ISAC Systems with Clipping Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Due to their inherent high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), OFDM waveforms are clipped to fit the limited dynamic range of the optical transmitters (e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs)), resulting in clipping distortion. To alleviate the impact of the distortion, we propose a novel transmitter architecture where the clipping processes are performed before NOMA superposition coding. We then analyze the performance of the proposed optical ISAC systems considering the effects of power allocation and clipping distortion. For the communication subsystem, we analyze the effect of NOMA on the achievable sum rate and bit error rate (BER). For the sensing subsystem, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of estimating the transmission distance accuracy are obtained. Simulation results reveal that allocating more power to the strong user yields a higher sum rate, lower BER, and better sensing performance, whereas a more balanced power allocation among users results in degraded BER and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Downlink Channel Estimation for mmWave Systems with Impulsive Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a channel estimation problem in a downlink millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which suffers from impulsive interference caused by hardware non-idealities or external disruptions. Specifically, impulsive interference presents a significant challenge to channel estimation due to its sporadic, unpredictable, and high-power nature. To tackle this issue, we develop a Bayesian channel estimation technique based on variational inference (VI) that leverages the sparsity of the mmWave channel in the angular domain and the intermittent nature of impulsive interference to minimize channel estimation errors. The proposed technique employs mean-field approximation to approximate posterior inference and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms baselines in terms of channel estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection-Based UE-Centric Inter-Cell Interference Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing spectral reuse can cause significant performance degradation due to interference from neighboring cells. In such scenarios, developing effective interference suppression schemes is necessary to improve overall system performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel user equipment-centric interference suppression scheme, which effectively detects inter-cell interference (ICI) and subsequently applies interference whitening to mitigate ICI. The proposed scheme, named Z-refined deep support vector data description, exploits a one-class classification-based anomaly detection technique. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms various baselines in terms of interference detection performance with limited time or frequency resources for training and is comparable to the performance based on an ideal genie-aided interference suppression scheme. Furthermore, we demonstrate through test equipment experiments using a commercial fifth-generation modem chipset that the proposed scheme shows performance improvements across various 3rd generation partnership project standard channel environments, including tapped delay line-A, -B, and -C models.</description>

      <title>A new class of Markov random fields enabling lightweight sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of efficient sampling of Markov random fields (MRF). The sampling of Potts or Ising MRF is most often based on Gibbs sampling, and is thus computationally expensive. We consider in this work how to circumvent this bottleneck through a link with Gaussian Markov Random fields. The latter can be sampled in several cost-effective ways, and we introduce a mapping from real-valued GMRF to discrete-valued MRF. The resulting new class of MRF benefits from a few theoretical properties that validate the new model. Numerical results show the drastic performance gain in terms of computational efficiency, as we sample at least 35x faster than Gibbs sampling using at least 37x less energy, all the while exhibiting empirical properties close to classical MRFs.</description>

      <title>Using ensemble learning with hybrid graph neural networks and transformers to predict traffic in cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) still have a hard time accurately predicting traffic in cities, especially in big, multimodal settings with complicated spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.</description>

      <title>VecComp: Vector Computing via MIMO Digital Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such, VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over noisy and fading multiple-access channels.</description>

      <title>Optimal Source Coding of Markov Chains for Real-Time Remote Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the source coding problem for a Markov chain under the assumption that the transmission times and how fast the Markov chain transitions its state happen at the same time-scale. Specifically, we assume that the transmission of each bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in the same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol determines the number of non-transmitted symbols, as well as, the probability of the realization of the next symbol to be transmitted. We aim to minimize the average transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal source coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission duration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov decision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission duration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark policies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy. We observe that, in randomly generated processes, our proposed optimal policy decreases the average transmission duration compared to benchmark policies. The performance gain varies based on the parameters of the Markov process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages the signal-superposition characteristic of wireless multiple access channels to perform mathematical computations. Initially introduced to enhance communication reliability in interference channels and wireless sensor networks, AirComp has more recently found applications in task-oriented communications, like wireless distributed learning and in wireless control systems. Its adoption aims to address latency challenges arising from an increased number of edge devices or Internet of Things (IoT) devices accessing the constrained wireless spectrum. This paper is the first one to focus on the physical layer of these systems. We present a unified framework, specifically on the waveform and the signal processing aspects at the transmitter and receiver to meet the challenges that AirComp presents within the different contexts and use cases.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Connectivity Approach for Exploring Epileptogenic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: This work presents a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the goal of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods and procedures: We consider the Phase Transfer Entropy (PTE) to estimate the effective connectivity between SEEG channels, and design a novel algorithm, named the Desynchronization Index (DI), that identifies the EZ as the group of channels showing independent behavior with respect to the rest of the network during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. Results: We test the proposed DI algorithm against the Epileptogenicity Index (EI) on a clinical dataset of 20 patients, considering the channels that were thermocoagulated at the end of SEEG monitoring as the detection target. Our results indicate that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.85 vs. AUC=0.83), while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). Conclusion: The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy in the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. Clinical impact: The integration of connectivity- and energy-based features can lead to the definition of a new biomarker of epileptogenic channels, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving the understanding of the dynamics behind the generation of seizures.</description>

      <title>A Block-Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm with Dictionary Parameter Estimation for Multi-Sensor Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method that leverages group sparsity and multiple parameterized dictionaries to detect the relevant dictionary entries and estimate their continuous parameters by combining data from multiple independent sensors. In a MIMO multi-radar setup, we demonstrate its effectiveness in jointly detecting and localizing multiple objects, while also emphasizing its broader applicability to various signal processing tasks. A key benefit of the proposed SBL-based method is its ability to resolve correlated dictionary entries-such as closely spaced objects-resulting in uncorrelated estimates that improve subsequent estimation stages.
  Through numerical simulations, we show that our method outperforms the newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) algorithm when two objects cross paths using a single radar. Furthermore, we illustrate how fusing measurements from multiple independent radars leads to enhanced detection and localization performance.</description>

      <title>NMCSE: Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation Method via Optimal Transport for Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling signal refers to a latent physiological signal that characterizes the transformation from cardiac electrical excitation, captured by the electrocardiogram (ECG), to mechanical contraction, recorded by the phonocardiogram (PCG). By encoding the temporal and functional interplay between electrophysiological and hemodynamic events, it serves as an intrinsic link between modalities and offers a unified representation of cardiac function, with strong potential to enhance multi-modal cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection. However, existing coupling signal estimation methods remain highly vulnerable to noise, particularly in real-world clinical and physiological settings, which undermines their robustness and limits practical value. In this study, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates coupling signal estimation as a distribution matching problem solved via optimal transport. By jointly aligning amplitude and timing, NMCSE avoids noise amplification and enables stable signal estimation. When integrated into a Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction (TSFE) network, the estimated coupling signal effectively enhances multi-modal fusion for more accurate CVD detection. To evaluate robustness under real-world conditions, we design two complementary experiments targeting distinct sources of noise. The first uses the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with simulated hospital noise to assess the resilience of NMCSE to clinical interference. The second leverages the EPHNOGRAM dataset with motion-induced physiological noise to evaluate intra-state estimation stability across activity levels. Experimental results show that NMCSE consistently outperforms existing methods under both clinical and physiological noise, highlighting it as a noise-robust estimation approach that enables reliable multi-modal cardiac detection in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</description>

      <title>Estimation of aboveground biomass in a tropical dry forest: An intercomparison of airborne, unmanned, and space laser scanning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev\.minimum, Elev\.L3, lev\.MAD\.mode, Elev\.mode, Elev\.MAD\.median, and Elev\.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while Leaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha. The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in estimating total biomass per plot.</description>

      <title>Stacked Flexible Intelligent Metasurface Design for Multi-User Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as an effective solution for next-generation wireless networks. A SIM comprises multiple metasurface layers that enable signal processing directly in the wave domain. Moreover, recent advances in flexible metamaterials have highlighted the potential of flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs), which can be physically morphed to enhance communication performance. In this paper, we propose a stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM)-based communication system for the first time, where each metasurface layer is deformable to improve the system's performance. We first present the system model, including the transmit and receive signal models as well as the channel model, and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system sum rate under constraints on the transmit power budget, morphing distance, and the unit-modulus condition of the meta-atom responses. To solve this problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework based on the gradient projection method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SFIM-based system achieves significant performance gains compared to its rigid SIM counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of static and rapidly moving targets demands three-dimensional imaging solutions with high temporal and spatial resolution. Radar sensors are a promising sensing modality because of their fast capture rates and their independence from lighting conditions. To achieve high spatial resolution, MIMO radars with large apertures are required. Yet, they are infrequently used for dynamic scenarios due to significant limitations in signal processing algorithms. These limitations impose substantial hardware constraints due to their computational intensity and reliance on large signal bandwidths, ultimately restricting the sensor's capture rate.
  One solution of previous work is to use few frequencies only, which enables faster capture and requires less computation; however, this requires coarse knowledge of the target's position and works in a limited depth range only. To address these challenges, we extend previous work into the multimodal domain with MM-2FSK, which leverages an assistive optical depth sensing modality to obtain a depth prior, enabling high framerate capture with only few frequencies.
  We evaluate our method using various target objects with known ground truth geometry that is spatially registered to real millimeter-wave MIMO radar measurements. Our method demonstrates superior performance in terms of depth quality, being able to compete with the time- and resource-intensive measurements with many frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a large-scale dataset called RASPNet for radar adaptive signal processing (RASP) applications to support the development of data-driven models within the adaptive radar community. RASPNet exceeds 16 TB in size and comprises 100 realistic scenarios compiled over a variety of topographies and land types across the contiguous United States. For each scenario, RASPNet comprises 10,000 clutter realizations from an airborne radar setting, which can be used to benchmark radar and complex-valued learning algorithms. RASPNet intends to fill a prominent gap in the availability of a large-scale, realistic dataset that standardizes the evaluation of RASP techniques and complex-valued neural networks. We outline its construction, organization, and several applications, including a transfer learning example to demonstrate how RASPNet can be used for real-world adaptive radar scenarios.</description>

      <title>Feature compression is the root cause of adversarial fragility in neural network classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we uniquely study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (NN) for classification tasks against that of optimal classifiers. We look at the smallest magnitude of possible additive perturbations that can change a classifier's output. We provide a matrix-theoretic explanation of the adversarial fragility of deep neural networks for classification. In particular, our theoretical results show that a neural network's adversarial robustness can degrade as the input dimension $d$ increases. Analytically, we show that neural networks' adversarial robustness can be only $1/\sqrt{d}$ of the best possible adversarial robustness of optimal classifiers. Our theories match remarkably well with numerical experiments of practically trained NN, including NN for ImageNet images. The matrix-theoretic explanation is consistent with an earlier information-theoretic feature-compression-based explanation for the adversarial fragility of neural networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an electromagnetic investigation of the crosstalk between two bent microstrip lines (MLs) separated by a perforated planar shield. As an extension of our previous study, the effects of various discontinuities in either the MLs or the shield along the coupling path are analyzed through numerical simulations and validated by measurements. The underlying electromagnetic mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, multimodal wave theory in a rectangular waveguide is applied to predict crosstalk behavior when the shield contains an aperture. This study aims to conceptually elucidate complex crosstalk phenomena that are difficult to model using circuit theory, and successful predictions of crosstalk behavior are presented for different problem cases.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.</description>
