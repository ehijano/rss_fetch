      <title>X-ray polarisation in AGN circumnuclear media. Polarisation framework and 2D torus models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold gas and dust reprocess the X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN), producing spectro-polarimetric features in the X-ray band. The recent launch of IXPE allows for observations of this X-ray polarisation signal, encoding unique information on the circumnuclear medium of AGN. However, the models for interpreting these polarimetric data are under-explored and do not reach the same level of sophistication as the corresponding spectral models. We aim at closing the gap between the spectral and spectro-polarimetric modelling of AGN circumnuclear media by providing the tools for simulating X-ray polarisation in complex 3D transfer media alongside X-ray spectra. We lay out the framework for X-ray polarisation in 3D radiative transfer simulations and provide an implementation to the 3D radiative transfer code SKIRT, focussing on (de)polarisation due to scattering and fluorescent re-emission. As a first application, we studied a 2D toroidal reprocessor of cold gas, modelling the AGN circumnuclear medium. For the 2D torus model, we find a complex behaviour of the polarisation angle with photon energy, which we interpret as a balance between the reprocessed photon flux originating from different sky regions, with a direct link to the torus geometry. We calculated a large grid of AGN torus models and demonstrated how spatially resolved polarisation maps could form a useful tool for interpreting the geometrical information that is encoded in IXPE observations. With this work, we release high-resolution AGN torus templates that simultaneously describe X-ray spectra and spectro-polarimetry, for observational data fitting with XSPEC. The SKIRT code can now model X-ray polarisation simultaneously with X-ray spectra and provide synthetic spectro-polarimetric observations for complex 3D circumnuclear media, with all features of the established SKIRT framework available.</description>

      <title>Explicit Asymptotic Solutions of $\nu_e + e^-$ Neutrino Networks for Large Sets of Partial Differential Equations in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In physics, accurately modeling large-scale phenomena such as core-collapse supernovae, (CCSN), and neutron star mergers are computationally challenging and require solving large sets of partial and ordinary differential equations. Traditional methods used widely in the scientific community are predominantly implicit, which are approximations that often require drastic simplifications and can be computationally inefficient. This thesis presents results on a new software suite titled "Fast Explicit Neutrino Networks" or "FENN", that introduces a suite of algebraically stabilized explicit methods known as explicit asymptotic for modeling Neutrino Electron Scattering, (NES), presenting a novel approach that combines the stability of traditional methods with enhanced computational efficiency. Initial results show that FENN can deliver accurate solutions for neutrino networks at improved computational speeds. This thesis further covers new results for scaled networks beyond the constraints of standard energy groupings, as well as the dynamics of neutrino interactions such as the scattering of various neutrino flavors -- electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$), electron anti-neutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$), and muon/tau neutrinos ($\nu_{\mu,\tau}$) as well as their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau}$) -- off electrons.</description>

      <title>Diversity in hydrogen-rich envelope mass of type II supernovae (II): SN 2023ixf as explosion of partially-stripped intermediate massive star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the most well-observed core-collapse supernova in recent decades, yet there is inconsistency in the inferred zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $M_{\rm ZAMS}$ of its progenitor. Direct observations of the pre-SN red supergiant (RSG) estimate $M_{\rm ZAMS}$ spanning widely from 11 to 18 $M_{\rm \odot}$. Additional constraints, including host environment and the pulsation of its progenitor RSG, suggest a massive progenitor with $M_{\rm ZAMS}$ &gt; 17 $M_{\rm \odot}$. However, the analysis of the properties of supernova, from light curve modeling to late phase spectroscopy, favor a relatively low mass scenario ($M_{\rm ZAMS}$ &lt; 15 $M_{\rm \odot}$). In this work, we conduct systematic analysis of SN 2023ixf, from the RSG progenitor, plateau phase light curve to late phase spectroscopy. Using MESA+STELLA to simulate the RSG progenitor and their explosions, we find that, despite the ZAMS mass of the RSG models being varied from 12.0 to 17.5 $M_{\rm \odot}$, they can produce light curves that well match with SN 2023ixf if the envelope mass and the explosion energy are allowed to vary. Using late phase spectroscopy as independent measurement, the oxygen emission line [O I] suggests the ZAMS is intermediate massive (~16.0 $M_{\rm \odot}$), and the relatively weak H$\alpha$ emission line indicates the hydrogen envelope has been partially removed before the explosion. By incorporating the velocity structure derived from the light curve modeling into an axisymmetric model, we successfully generated [O I] line profiles that are consistent with the [O I] line observed in late phase spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf. Bringing these analyses together, we conclude that SN 2023ixf is the aspherical explosion of an intermediate massive star ($M_{\rm ZAMS}$ = 15-16 $M_{\rm \odot}$) with the hydrogen envelope being partially stripped to 4-5 $M_{\rm \odot}$ prior to its explosion.</description>

      <title>A simple model of dust extinction in gamma-ray burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are powerful probes for studying the different properties of their host galaxies (e.g., the interstellar dust) at all redshifts. By fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) over a large range of wavelengths, we can gain direct insights into the properties of the interstellar dust by studying the extinction curves. Unlike the dust extinction templates, such as the average Milky Way (MW) or the Small and Large Magellanic Cloud (SMC and LMC), the extinction curves of galaxies outside the Local Group exhibit deviation from these laws. Altogether, X-ray and gamma-ray satellites as well as ground-based telescopes, such as Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and Gamma-Ray Optical and Near-Infrared Detector (GROND), provide measurements of the afterglows from the X-ray to the NIR, which can be used to extract information on dust extinction curves along their lines of sight. The study presented in this paper undertakes such a photometric study, comprising a preparatory work for the SVOM mission and its ground-based follow-up telescope COLIBRI. We propose a simple parameterization of the dust extinction curve of GRB host galaxies. Our model is based on a power law form with the addition of a Loretzian-like Drude profile with two parameters: the extinction slope, $\gamma$, and the 2175 $\AA$ bump amplitude, $E_\rm{b}$. Using the seven GROND filter bands, we tested our dust extinction model and explored the parameter space in extinction and redshift by fitting SEDs of simplified simulations of GRB afterglow spectra based on different extinction curve templates. From a final sample of 10 real Swift/GROND extinguished GRBs, we determined the quantities of the dust extinction in their host and measured their extinction curves. The measured average extinction curve is equivalent to a quasi-featureless in-between SMC-LMC template.</description>

      <title>Indication of rapid magnetic field decay in X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Star RX J0720.4-3125</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field evolution of neutron stars is a long-standing debate. The rate of magnetic field decay for isolated, non-accreting neutron stars can be quantified by measuring the negative second derivative of the spin period. Alternatively, this rate can be estimated by observing an excess of thermal emission with respect to the standard cooling without additional heating mechanisms involved. One of the nearby cooling isolated neutron stars -- RX J0720.4-3125, -- offers a unique opportunity to probe the field decay as for this source there are independent measurements of the surface X-ray luminosity, the second spin period derivative, and magnetic field. We demonstrate that the evolution rate of the spin period derivative is in correspondence with the rate of dissipation of magnetic energy of the dipolar field if a significant part of the released energy is emitted in X-rays. The instantaneous time scale for the magnetic field decay is $\sim 10^4$ years.</description>

      <title>Triple trouble with PSR J1618-3921: Mass measurements and orbital dynamics of an eccentric millisecond pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J1618-3921 is one of five known millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in eccentric orbits (eMPSs) located in the Galactic plane, whose formation is poorly understood. Earlier studies of these objects revealed significant discrepancies between observation and predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios of pulsar-Helium white dwarf binaries. We conducted observations with the L-band receiver of the MeerKAT radio telescope and the UWL receiver of the Parkes Murriyang radio telescope between 2019 and 2021. These data were added to archival observations. We perform an analysis of this joint 23-year-dataset. We use the recent observations to give a brief account of the emission properties of J1618-3921, including a Rotating Vector model fit of the linear polarisation position angle of the pulsar. The long timing baseline allowed for a highly significant measurement of the rate of advance of periastron of $\dot{\omega}$. We can only report a low significance detection of the orthometric Shapiro delay parameters $h_3$ and $\varsigma$, leading to mass estimates of the total and individual binary masses. We detect an unexpected change in the orbital period of, which is an order of magnitude larger and carries an opposite sign to what is expected from Galactic acceleration and the Shklovskii effect. We also detect a significant second derivative of the spin frequency. Furthermore, we report an unexpected, abrupt change of the mean pulse profile in June 2021 with unknown origin. We propose that the anomalous $\dot{P_b}$ and $\ddot{f}$ indicate an additional varying acceleration due to a nearby mass, i.e., the J1618-3921 binary system is likely part of a hierarchical triple. This finding suggests that at least some eMSPs might have formed in triple star systems. Although the uncertainties are large, the binary companion mass is consistent with the $P_b$ - $M_{WD}$ relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyse the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) using an observationally-driven model for ensemble properties of pulsar noise. We show that the revised gravitational wave background properties are in better agreement with theoretical expectations for the strain spectrum. Our improved model for ensemble pulsar noise properties reduces a systematic error at $1\sigma$ level and increases Bayesian odds of Hellings-Downs correlations by $\sim 10\%$.</description>

      <title>A splitting method for numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel splitting approach to numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) designed to expand its applicability to the domain of ultra-high magnetisation (high-$\sigma$). In this approach, the electromagnetic field is split into the force-free component and its perturbation due to the plasma inertia. Accordingly, the system of RMHD equations is extended to include the subsystem of force-free degenerate electrodynamics and the subsystem governing the plasma dynamics and the perturbation of the force-free field. The combined system of conservation laws is integrated simultaneously, to which aim various numerical techniques can be used, and the force-free field is recombined with its perturbation at the end of every timestep. To explore the potential of this splitting approach, we combined it with a 3rd-order WENO method, and carried out a variety of 1D and 2D test simulations. The simulations confirm the robustness of the splitting method in the high-$\sigma$ regime, and also show that it remains accurate in the low-$\sigma$ regime, all the way down to $\sigma$ = 0. Thus, the method can be used for simulating complex astrophysical flows involving a wide range of physical parameters. The numerical resistivity of the code obeys a simple ansatz and allows fast magnetic reconnection in the plasmoid-dominated regime. The results of simulations involving thin and long current sheets agree very well with the theory of resistive magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The null hypothesis in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analyses includes assumptions about ensemble properties of pulsar time-correlated noise. These properties are encoded in prior probabilities for the amplitude and the spectral index of the power-law power spectral density of temporal correlations of the noise. In this work, we introduce a new procedure for numerical marginalisation over the uncertainties in pulsar noise priors. The procedure may be used in searches for nanohertz gravitational waves and other PTA analyses to resolve prior misspecification at negligible computational cost. Furthermore, we infer the distribution of amplitudes and spectral indices of the power spectral density of spin noise and dispersion measure variation noise based on the observation of 25 millisecond pulsars by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). Our results may be used for the simulation of realistic noise in PTAs.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Analytical Model for Stellar Evolution in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disks of gas accreting onto supermassive black holes may host numerous stellar-mass objects, formed within the disk or captured from a nuclear star cluster. We present a simplified model of stellar evolution applicable to these dense environments; our model exhibits exquisite agreement with full stellar evolution calculations at a minuscule fraction of the cost. Although the model presented here is limited to stars burning hydrogen in their cores, it is sufficient to determine the evolutionary fate of disk-embedded stars: whether they proceed to later stages of nuclear burning and leave behind a compact remnant, reach a quasi-steady state where mass loss and accretion balance one another, or whether accretion proceeds faster than stellar structure can adjust, causing a runaway. We provide numerous examples, highlighting how various disk parameters, and effects such as gap opening, affect stellar evolution outcomes. We also highlight how our model can accommodate time-varying conditions, such as those experienced by a star on an eccentric orbit, and can couple to N-body integrations. This model will enable more detailed studies of stellar populations and their interaction with accretion disks than have previously been possible.</description>

      <title>A New IW And-Type Star: Karachurin 12 with Tilted Disks and Diverse cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IW And phenomenon in cataclysmic variables presents a significant challenge to the accretion disk instability model. Using photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we identify Karachurin 12 as a new IW And-type object with a cycle period of 35.69(3) days. We also report for the first time that Karachurin 12 is a negative superhump (NSH) system featuring a precessing tilted disk, with precession, orbital, and NSH periods of 4.9588(2) days, 0.3168895(13) days, and 0.2979861(8) days, respectively. Our analysis, using dips as indexes and NSHs as probes, reveals diverse cycle patterns in Karachurin 12, with NSH amplitude varying throughout the cycle. Analyses of NSH behaviour using multiple methods shows that the amplitude decreases with increasing outbursts and increases with weakening outbursts, which we suggest is related to changes in the radius of the accretion disk. The mass transfer outburst model fails to explain the observed NSH amplitude variations, whereas the tilted thermally unstable disk model accounts for most of the observed cycles and dip patterns, particularly the disappearance of the IW And phenomenon when NSHs become undetectable. However, no significant changes in the NSH period were observed. These findings suggest a potential link between the IW And phenomenon and a tilted disk. Further improvements in simulations are needed to better understand the detailed dynamics of these cycles.</description>

Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>

      <title>Asking Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) for More than Reionization History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose different estimators to probe the epoch of reionization (EoR) intergalactic medium (IGM) using the dispersion measure (${\rm DM}$) of the FRBs. We consider three different reionization histories which we can distinguish with a total of $\lesssim 1000$ ${\rm DM}$ measurements during EoR if their redshifts are known. We note that the redshift derivatives of ${\rm DM}$ are also directly sensitive to the reionization history. The major point of this work is exploring the variance in the ${\rm DM}$ measurements and the information encoded in them. We find that the all-sky average $\overline{{\rm DM}}(z)$ gets biased from the LoS fluctuations in the ${\rm DM}$ measurements introduced by the ionization of IGM during EoR. We find that the ratio $\sigma_{\rm DM}/\overline{{\rm DM}}$ depends directly on the ionization bubble sizes as well as the reionization history. On the other hand, we also find that angular variance (coined as $structure$ $function$) of ${\rm DM}$ encodes the information about the duration of reionization and the typical bubble sizes as well. We establish the usefulness of variances in ${\rm DM}$ using toy models of reionization and later verify it with the realistic reionization simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the expanding integration of infrared instruments in astronomical missions, accurate per-pixel flux estimation for near-infrared hybrid detectors has become critical to the success of these missions. Based on CPPM's involvement in both SVOM/Colibri and Euclid missions, this study introduces universally applicable methods and framework for characterizing IR hybrid detectors and decorrelating their intrinsic properties. The characterization framework, applied to the ALFA detector and \Euclid's H2RG, not only validates the proposed methods but also points out subtle behaviors inherent to each detector.</description>

      <title>The Completeness of Accreting Neutron Star Binary Candidates from the Chinese Space Station Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) has many extreme physical conditions, and one may obtain some important informations about NS via accreting neutron star binary (ANSB) systems. The upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) provides an opportunity to search for a large sample of ANSB candidates. Our goal is to check the completeness of the potential ANSB samples from CSST data. In this paper, we generate some ANSBs and normal binaries under CSST photometric system by binary evolution and binary population synthesis method and use a machine learning method to train a classification model. Although the Precision ($94.56~ \%$) of our machine learning model is as high as before study, the Recall is only about $63.29~ \%$. The Precision/Recall is mainly determined by the mass transfer rate between the NSs and their companions. In addition, we also find that the completeness of ANSB samples from CSST photometric data by the machine learning method also depends on the companion mass and the age of the system. ANSB candidates with low initial mass companion star ($0.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $1~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have a relatively high Precision ($94.94~ \%$) and high Recall ($86.32~ \%$), whereas ANSB candidates with higher initial mass companion star ($1.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $3~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have similar Precision ($93.88~ \%$) and quite low Recall ($42.67~ \%$). Our results indicate that although the machine learning method may obtain a relative pure sample of ANSBs, a completeness correction is necessary for one to obtain a complete sample.</description>

      <title>The Role of $r$-Modes in Pulsar Spindown, Pulsar Timing and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of r-modes in the spin-down of pulsars, focusing on their implications for pulsar timing and gravitational wave emissions. Our study employs a non-linear differential equation incorporating the contribution of r-modes to derive time-dependent rotational frequency and period functions. This model is validated against observational data from the Crab pulsar, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy. By fitting the braking indices and spin-down coefficients, we establish direct and analytical relationships between observable pulsar properties and weak gravitational wave signals. We also derive analytical expressions for neutron star compactness and tidal deformability using Lambert W solutions, independent of the equation of state (EoS). These solutions provide new insights into the mathematical relationships between physical quantities, constraining the parameter space for r-mode gravitational wave frequency searches. Our results show that incorporating r-modes significantly enhances our ability to measure the neutron star EoS and predict pulsar age, rotational velocity, and gravitational wave frequencies. The seventh-order approximation used in our model is essential for accurately capturing the contributions of r-modes to the spin-down process. This framework can be applied to model pulsar timing residuals, account for glitches, and improve the detection and analysis of continuous gravitational waves from pulsars. With the advent of next-generation gravitational wave detectors, our findings offer promising prospects for disentangling individual events from the stochastic gravitational wave background, advancing our understanding of neutron star interiors and their dynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Detection of X-ray Polarization in the High Synchrotron Peaked Blazar 1ES 1959+650</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the measurement of X-ray polarization in the high synchrotron peaked blazar 1ES 1959+650. Of the four epochsof observations from the {\it Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer}, we detected polarization in the 2$-$8 keV band on two epochs. From model-independent analysis of the observations on 28 October 2022, in the 2$-$8 keV band, we found the degree of polarization of $\Pi_X$ = 9.0 $\pm$ 1.6\% and an electric vector position angle of $\psi_X$ = 53 $\pm$ 5 deg. Similarly, from the observations on 14 August 2023, we found $\Pi_X$ and $\psi_X$ values as 12.5 $\pm$ 0.7\% and 20 $\pm$ 2 deg, respectively. These values are also in agreement with the values obtained from spectro-polarimetric analysis of the I, Q, and U spectra. The measured X-ray polarization is larger than the reported values in the optical, that ranges between 2.5$-$9\% , when observed during 2008 to 2018. Broadband spectral energy distribution constructed for the two epochs are well described by the one zone leptonic emission model with the bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$) of the jet larger on 14 August 2023 compared to 28 October 2022. Our results favour shock acceleration of the particles in the jet, with the difference in $\Pi_X$ between the two epochs being influenced by change in the $\Gamma$ of the jet.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal Signatures of Radiative Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The end of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution is characterized by a so-called "radiative" stage, in which efficient cooling of the hot bubble inside the forward shock slows expansion, leading to eventual shock breakup. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is vital for predicting feedback in galaxies, since SNRs are expected to deposit their energy and momentum into the interstellar medium at the ends of their lives. A key prediction of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock. However, searches for these shells via their neutral hydrogen emission have had limited success. We instead introduce an independent observational signal of shell formation arising from the interaction between nonthermal particles accelerated by the SNR forward shock (cosmic rays) and the dense shell. Using a semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on state-of-the-art simulations coupled with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of SNR evolution, we predict the nonthermal emission that arises from this interaction. We demonstrate that the onset of the radiative stage leads to nonthermal signatures from radio to $\gamma$-rays, including radio and $\gamma$-ray brightening by nearly two orders of magnitude. Such a signature may be detectable with current instruments, and will be resolvable with the next generation of gamma-ray telescopes (namely, the Cherenkov Telescope Array).</description>

      <title>Force-free wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres: Computational modeling in axisymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfv\'en waves to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves interact in the equatorial region. Alfv\'en waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, Alfv\'en waves convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric Alfv\'en wave crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of 'bouncing' Alfv\'en waves by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long-wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Galactic Center PeVatron Beyond 100 TeV with HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an observation of ultra-high energy (UHE) gamma rays from the Galactic Center region, using seven years of data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. The HAWC data are best described as a point-like source (HAWC J1746-2856) with a power-law spectrum ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}E=\phi(E/26 \,\text{TeV})^{\gamma}$), where $\gamma=-2.88 \pm 0.15_{\text{stat}} - 0.1_{\text{sys}} $ and $\phi=1.5 \times 10^{-15}$ (TeV cm$^{2}$s)$^{-1}$ $\pm\, 0.3_{\text{stat}}\,^{+0.08_{\text{sys}}}_{-0.13_{\text{sys}}}$ extending from 6 to 114 TeV. We find no evidence of a spectral cutoff up to $100$ TeV using HAWC data. Two known point-like gamma-ray sources are spatially coincident with the HAWC gamma-ray excess: Sgr A$^{*}$ (HESS J1745-290) and the Arc (HESS J1746-285). We subtract the known flux contribution of these point sources from the measured flux of HAWC J1746-2856 to exclude their contamination and show that the excess observed by HAWC remains significant ($&gt;$5$\sigma$) with the spectrum extending to $&gt;$100 TeV. Our result supports that these detected UHE gamma rays can originate via hadronic interaction of PeV cosmic-ray protons with the dense ambient gas and confirms the presence of a proton PeVatron at the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Spin-up: 3D Simulations of Post-Glitch Dynamics in Neutron Star Cores</title>

Abstract: The dynamics of a neutron star after a glitch involve the transfer of angular momentum from the crust (where the glitch is presumed to originate) to the liquid core, causing the core to spin up. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. Although the complex nature of these mechanisms has made it difficult to study their combined effects, analytical estimations for individual processes reveal that spin-up timescales vary according to the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, as well as the magnetic field. However, experimental and numerical validations of those analytical predictions are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction. We conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Uniform Modeling of Observed Kilonovae: Implications for Diversity and the Progenitors of Merger-Driven Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present uniform modeling of eight kilonovae, five following short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; including GRB170817A) and three following long GRBs. We model their broadband afterglows to determine the relative contributions of afterglow and kilonova emission. We fit the kilonovae using a three-component model in MOSFiT that accounts for ejecta geometry, and find population median ejecta masses for the total, blue ($\kappa_{B} = 0.5$ cm^2 / g), purple ($\kappa_{P} = 3$ cm^2 / g), and red ($\kappa_{R} = 10$ cm^2 / g) components of $M_{ej, tot} = 0.085_{-0.040}^{+0.110} M_{\odot}$, $M_{ej, B} = 0.006_{-0.004}^{+0.015} M_{\odot}$, $M_{ej, P} = 0.020_{-0.010}^{+0.034} M_{\odot}$, and $M_{ej, R} = 0.051_{-0.045}^{+0.100} M_{\odot}$ (68% confidence). The kilonova of GW170817 is near the median of the sample in most derived properties, while the sample indicates great diversity. We investigate trends between the ejecta masses and the isotropic-equivalent and beaming-corrected gamma-ray energies ($E_{\gamma, iso}$, $E_{\gamma}$), as well as rest-frame durations ($T_{90, rest}$). We find long GRB kilonovae have higher median red ejecta masses ($M_{ej, R} &gt; 0.05 M_{\odot}$) compared to on-axis short GRB kilonovae ($M_{ej, R} &lt; 0.02 M_{\odot}$). We also observe a weak scaling between the total and red ejecta masses with $E_{\gamma, iso}$ and $E_{\gamma}$, though a larger sample is needed to establish a significant correlation. These findings imply a connection between merger-driven long GRBs and larger tidal dynamical ejecta masses, which may indicate that their progenitors are asymmetric compact object binaries. We produce representative kilonova light curves and find that the planned depths and cadences of the Rubin and Roman Observatory surveys will be sufficient for order-of-magnitude constraints on $M_{ej, B}$ (and, for Roman, $M_{ej, P}$ and $M_{ej, R}$) of future kilonovae at $z &lt; 0.1$.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of autonomous radio-detection units to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to discover them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Presently, three prototype GRAND radio arrays are in operation: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nancay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the design of the radio-detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a look at the first data collected by GRANDProto13, the first phase of GRANDProto300.</description>

      <title>Particle motion around luminous neutron stars: effects of deviation from Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study trajectories of test particles around a luminous, static, spherically symmetric neutron star, under the combined influence of gravity and radiation. In general relativity, for Schwarzschild spacetime, an equilibrium sphere (the Eddington Capture Sphere) is formed for near-Eddington luminosities. We generalize these results to a broad class of static, spherical spacetimes. We also study the dynamics of particles in a strong radiation field in spherical spacetimes. The results are illustrated for two cases, Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime of a charged spherical object in general relativity and Kehagias-Sfetsos spacetime, arising from the Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory. Our findings apply to neutron stars under gravitational field equations different from the vacuum Einstein field equations of general relativity, such as in modified theories of gravity, the only requirement being that test particles follow geodesics in the absence of the radiation field. The effects that we describe are, in principle, measurable through observations of X-ray bursts of neutron stars. Hence, detailed future studies could use such observations to test gravity theories in the strong-field regime, provided that the impact of the spacetime geometry can be disentangled from the astrophysical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Tayler Instability Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields $B_\phi$ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of $B_\phi$, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number $Pm\ll 1$ (e.g. the Sun) and $Pm\gg 1$ (e.g. protoneutron stars). The parameter dependence of unstable modes suggests a non-universal scaling of the possible Tayler-Spruit dynamo.</description>

      <title>On the single versus the repetitive Penrose process in a Kerr black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (BH) is one of the crucial topics in relativistic astrophysics. Here, we give special attention to the Penrose ballistic process based on the fission of a massive particle $\mu_0$ into two particles $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, occurring in the ergosphere of a Kerr BH. Bardeen et al. indicated that for the process to occur, some additional "hydrodynamical forces or superstrong radiation reactions" were needed. Wald and Chandrasekhar further expanded this idea. This animosity convinced T. Piran and collaborators to move from a simple three-body system characterizing the original Penrose process to a many-body system. This many-body approach was further largely expanded by others, some questionable in their validity. Here, we return to the simplest original Penrose process and show that the solution of the equations of motion, imposing the turning point condition on their trajectories, leads to the rotational energy extraction from the BH expected by Penrose. The efficiency of energy extraction by a single process is quantified for three different single decay processes occurring respectively at $r=1.2 M$, $r=1.5 M$, and $r=1.9 M$. An interesting repetitive model has been proposed by Misner, Thorne \&amp; Wheeler (hereafter MTW73). Indeed, it would appear that a repetitive sequence of $246$ decays of the above injection process at $r=1.2 M$ and the corresponding ones at $r=1.5 M$ and $r=1.9 M$ could extract $100\%$ of the rotational energy of the BH, so violating energy conservation. The accompanying paper, accounting for the existence of the BH irreducible mass, introduces a non-linear approach that avoids violating energy conservation and leads to a new energy extraction process.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr black hole (BH), in turn leading to its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This also allowed the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations, soon followed by the concepts of "extracted" and "extractable" energy. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show the processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, the particle that the BH captures causes an increase of the irreducible mass (so the BH horizon), much larger than the extracted energy. The energy extraction process stops {when the BH reaches a positive spin lower limit set by the process boundary conditions}. Thus, the reaching of a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state through this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for selected decay radii and incoming particle with rest mass $1\%$ of the BH initial mass $M_0$. For $r= 1.2 M$ and $1.9 M$, the sequence stops after $8$ and $34$ decays, respectively, at a spin $0.991$ and $0.857$, the energy extracted has been only $1.16\%$, and $0.42\%$, the extractable energy is reduced by $17\%$ and $56\%$, and the irreducible mass increases by $5\%$ and $22\%$, all values in units of $M_0$. These results show the highly nonlinear change of the BH parameters, dictated by the BH mass-energy formula, and that the BH rotational energy is mainly converted into irreducible mass. Thus, evaluating the irreducible mass increase in any energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is mandatory.</description>

      <title>Tests of general relativity at the fourth post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently computed post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational-wave phasing up to 4.5PN order accounts for several novel physical effects in compact binary dynamics such as the {\it tail of the memory, tails of tails of tails and tails of mass hexadecupole and current octupole moments}. Therefore, it is instructive to assess the ability of current-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO/Virgo, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope and space-based detectors like LISA to test the predictions of PN theory at these orders. Employing Fisher information matrix, we find that the projected bounds on the deviations from the logarithmic PN phasing coefficient at 4PN is ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-1})$ for XG and 2G detectors, respectively. Similarly, the projected bounds on other three PN coefficients that appear at 4PN and 4.5PN are ${\cal O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$ for XG and ${\cal O}(1)$ for 2G detectors. LISA observations of supermassive BHs could provide the tightest constraints on these four parameters ranging from ${\cal O}(10^{-4}-10^{-2})$. The variation in these bounds are studied as a function of total mass and the mass ratio of the binaries in quasi-circular orbits. These new tests are unique probes of higher order nonlinear interactions in compact binary dynamics and their consistency with the predictions of general relativity.</description>
