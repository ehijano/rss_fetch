      <title>Topology and Diffeology via Metric-like Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates spaces equipped with a family of metric-like functions satisfying certain axioms. These functions provide a unified framework for defining topology, uniformity, and diffeology. The framework is based on a family of metric-like functions originally introduced for spaces of submanifolds. We show that the topologies, uniformities, and diffeologies of these spaces can be systematically derived from the proposed axioms. Furthermore, the framework covers examples such as spaces with compact-open topologies, tiling spaces, and spaces of graphs, which have appeared in different contexts. These results support the study of spaces with metric-like structures from both topological and diffeological perspectives.</description>

      <title>Multiple gaps and some finitizations of club and CH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the development of the theory of capturing schemes over $\omega_1$ by analyzing the relation between the capturing construction schemes (whose existence is implied by Jensen's $\Diamond$-principle) and both the Continuum Hypothesis and Ostaszewski's $\clubsuit$-principle. Formally, we show that the property of being capturing can be viewed as the conjunction of two properties, one of which is implied by $\clubsuit$ and the other one by CH. We apply these principles to construct multiple gaps, entangled sets and metric spaces without uncountable monotone subspaces.</description>

      <title>Modular topologies on vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the topological structures induced on vector spaces by convex modulars that do not satisfy the $\Delta_2$ condition, with particular focus on their applications to variable exponent spaces such as \( \ell^{(p_n)} \) and \( L^{p(\cdot)} \). The motivation behind this investigation is its applicability to the study of boundary value problems involving the variable exponent $p(x)$-Laplacian when $p(x)$ is unbounded, a line of research recently opened by the authors. Fundamental topological properties are analyzed, including separation axioms, countability axioms, and the relationship between modular convergence and classical topological concepts such as continuity. Attention is given to the relation between modular and norm topologies. Special emphasis is placed on the openness of modular balls, the impact of the \(\Delta_2\)-condition, and duality with respect to modular topologies.</description>
