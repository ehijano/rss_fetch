      <title>Generalized mKdV Equation and Genus Two Jacobi Type Hyperelliptic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02621v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalized the mKdV equation in order that the static equations include ${\rm sn}$ differential equation. As a result, a good correspondence was obtained between the KdV equation and the mKdV equation.For general genus two hyperelliptic curves, we obtained differential equations for Weierstrass type and Jacobi type hyperelliptic functions. Considering the special case of $\lambda_6=0, \lambda_0=0$, Weierstrass type and Jacobi type hyperelliptic functions are different solutions to the same hyperelliptic differential equations. Then these solutions are connected by the special ${\rm Sp(4, {\bf R})}$ Lie group transformation.</description>

      <title>Stokes' phenomenon in continuous limits of discrete Painlev\'{e} I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use exponential asymptotic analysis to identify the relevance of Stokes' phenomenon to integrability in discrete systems. We study Stokes' phenomenon in two discrete problems with the same (leading-order) continuous limit, a finite-difference discretisation of the first continuous Painlev\'{e} equation and the first discrete Painlev\'{e} equation, as well as a family of differential equation associated with each discrete problem. This analysis reveals two important observations. Firstly, the orderly behaviour that characterises Stokes' phenomenon in discrete equations emerges naturally from corresponding continuous differential equations as the order of the latter increases, although this is not apparent at low orders. Secondly, Stokes' phenomenon vanishes in the continuum limit of the integrable discrete equation, but not the non-integrable discrete equation. This means that subdominant exponentials do not appear in the integrable equation, and therefore do not cause moveable singularities to form in the solution. The results are clarified further by consideration of one-parameter family of difference equations that interpolates between the two considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting tsunami-like solitons with a rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductors. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator using Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger--Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with a superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with an arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we term \textit{the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) rocks}. In the Zakharov--Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions originates from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multivalued Baker--Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider their classification.</description>
