      <title>On the stability of singular Hopf bifurcation and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, research on the complex periodic behavior of multi-scale systems has become increasingly popular. Krupa et al. \cite{krupa2} provided a way to obtain relaxation oscillations in slow-fast systems through singular Hopf bifurcations and canard explosion. The authors derived a $O(1)$ expression $A$ for the first Lyapunov coefficient (under the condition $A \neq 0$), and deduced the bifurcation curves of singular Hopf and canard explosions.
  This paper employs Blow-up technique, normal form theory, and Lyapunov coefficient formula to present higher-order approximate expressions for the first Lyapunov coefficient when $A=0$ for slow-fast systems. As an application, we investigate the bifurcation phenomena of a predator-prey model with Allee effects. Utilizing the formulas obtained in this paper, we identify both supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations that may occur simultaneously in the system. Numerical simulations validate the results. Finally, by normal form and slow divergence integral theory, we prove the cyclicity of the system is 1.</description>

      <title>A characterization of $(\mu,\nu)$-dichotomies via admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a characterization of $(\mu,\nu)$-dichotomies in terms of the admissibility of certain pairs of weighted spaces for nonautonomous discrete time dynamics acting on Banach spaces. Our general framework enables us to treat various settings in which no similar result has been previously obtained as well as to recover and refine several known results. We emphasize that our results hold without any bounded growth assumption and the statements make no use of Lyapunov norms. Moreover, as a consequence of our characterization, we study the robustness of $(\mu, \nu)$-dichotomies, i.e. we show that this notion persists under small but very general linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Realizability of Subgroups by Subshifts of Finite Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of realizing families of subgroups as the set of stabilizers of configurations from a subshift of finite type (SFT). This problem generalizes both the existence of strongly and weakly aperiodic SFTs. We show that a finitely generated normal subgroup is realizable if and only if the quotient by the subgroup admits a strongly aperiodic SFT. We also show that if a subgroup is realizable, its subgroup membership problem must be decidable. The article also contains the introduction of periodically rigid groups, which are groups for which every weakly aperiodic subshift of finite type is strongly aperiodic. We conjecture that the only finitely generated periodically rigid groups are virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ groups and torsion-free virtually $\mathbb{Z}^2$ groups. Finally, we show virtually nilpotent and polycyclic groups satisfy the conjecture.</description>

      <title>L-shadowing lemma for the Cauchy equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if the Cauchy problem $\dot{u}=Au$ in a Banach space is hyperbolic, then the problem has the L-shadowing property. Conversely, if the space is finite-dimensional and the L-shadowing property is satisfied, then the problem is hyperbolic. This generalizes a previous result by Ombach \cite{o, o1} for linear homeomorphisms. Some short applications are given.</description>

      <title>Benign Nonconvex Landscapes in Optimal and Robust Control, Part II: Extended Convex Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many optimal and robust control problems are nonconvex and potentially nonsmooth in their policy optimization forms. In Part II of this paper, we introduce a new and unified Extended Convex Lifting (ECL) framework to reveal hidden convexity in classical optimal and robust control problems from a modern optimization perspective. Our ECL offers a bridge between nonconvex policy optimization and convex reformulations, enabling convex analysis for nonconvex problems. Despite non-convexity and non-smoothness, the existence of an ECL not only reveals that minimizing the original function is equivalent to a convex problem but also certifies a class of first-order non-degenerate stationary points to be globally optimal. Therefore, no spurious stationarity exists in the set of non-degenerate policies. This ECL framework can cover many benchmark control problems, including state feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR), dynamic output feedback linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ robust control. ECL can also handle a class of distributed control problems when the notion of quadratic invariance (QI) holds. We further show that all static stabilizing policies are non-degenerate for state feedback LQR and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control under standard assumptions. We believe that the new ECL framework may be of independent interest for analyzing nonconvex problems beyond control.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Stability of Planar Travelling Waves for Stochastically Perturbed Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider reaction-diffusion systems with multiplicative noise on a spatial domain of dimension two or higher. The noise process is white in time, coloured in space, and invariant under translations. In the deterministic setting, multidimensional stability of planar waves on the whole space $\mathbb R^d$ has been studied by many. Inspired by previous works on the real line, we establish the multidimensional stability of planar waves on a cylindrical domain on time scales that are exponentially long with respect to the noise strength. This is achieved by means of a stochastic phase tracking mechanism that can be maintained over such long time scales. The corresponding mild formulation of our problem features stochastic integrals with respect to anticipating integrands, which hence cannot be understood within the well-established setting of It\^o-integrals. To circumvent this problem, we exploit and extend recently developed theory concerning forward integrals.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the effect of mean subtraction on Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03607v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any autonomous nonlinear dynamical system can be viewed as a superposition of infinitely many linear processes, through the so-called Koopman mode decomposition. Its data-driven approximation- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)- has been extensively developed and deployed across a plethora of fields. In this work, we study the effect of subtracting the temporal mean on the DMD approximation, for observables possessing only a finite number of Koopman modes.
  Pre-processing time-sequential training data by removing the temporal mean has been a point of contention in the Companion matrix formulation of DMD. This stems from the potential of said pre-processing to render DMD equivalent to a temporal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We prove that this equivalence is impossible when the training data is linearly consistent and the order of the DMD approximation exceeds the number of Koopman modes. Since model order and training set size are synonymous in this variant of DMD, the parity of DMD and DFT can, therefore, be indicative of inadequate training data.</description>

Abstract: In this work we use our previous results on the topological classification of generic singular foliation germs on $(\mathbb C^{2},0)$ to construct complete families: after fixing the semi-local topological invariants we prove the existence of a minimal family of foliation germs that contain all the topological classes and such that any equisingular global family with parameter space an arbitrary complex manifold factorizes through it.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution without stability for toric surface maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an equidistribution result for iterated preimages of curves by a large class of rational maps $f:\mathbb{CP}^2\dashrightarrow\mathbb{CP}^2$ that cannot be birationally conjugated to algebraically stable maps. The maps, which include recent examples with transcendental first dynamical degree, are distinguished by the fact that they have constant Jacobian determinant relative to the natural holomorphic two form on the algebraic torus. Under the additional hypothesis that $f$ has "small topological degree'' we also prove an equidistribution result for iterated forward images of curves.
  To prove our results we systematically develop the idea of a positive closed $(1,1)$ current and its cohomology class on the inverse limit of all toric surfaces. This, in turn, relies upon a careful study of positive closed $(1,1)$ currents on individual toric surfaces. This framework may be useful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>On Escape rate for subshift with Markov measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a subshift of finite type with Markov measure. By considering a union of cylinders as holes, we investigate the exponential growth rate of measure of points whose orbits do not escape into the hole over a fixed number of iterations. We present two formulations for this escape rate: one based on the spectral radius of the Hadamard product of a related adjacency matrix and the stochastic matrix with respect to which the Markov measure is defined, and the other utilizing a recurrence relation. These formulations enable a comparative analysis of escape rates into distinct holes.</description>

      <title>DySLIM: Dynamics Stable Learning by Invariant Measure for Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamics from dissipative chaotic systems is notoriously difficult due to their inherent instability, as formalized by their positive Lyapunov exponents, which exponentially amplify errors in the learned dynamics. However, many of these systems exhibit ergodicity and an attractor: a compact and highly complex manifold, to which trajectories converge in finite-time, that supports an invariant measure, i.e., a probability distribution that is invariant under the action of the dynamics, which dictates the long-term statistical behavior of the system. In this work, we leverage this structure to propose a new framework that targets learning the invariant measure as well as the dynamics, in contrast with typical methods that only target the misfit between trajectories, which often leads to divergence as the trajectories' length increases. We use our framework to propose a tractable and sample efficient objective that can be used with any existing learning objectives. Our Dynamics Stable Learning by Invariant Measure (DySLIM) objective enables model training that achieves better point-wise tracking and long-term statistical accuracy relative to other learning objectives. By targeting the distribution with a scalable regularization term, we hope that this approach can be extended to more complex systems exhibiting slowly-variant distributions, such as weather and climate models.</description>

      <title>Localization for quasi-one-dimensional Dirac operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random family of Dirac operators on $N$ parallel real lines, modelling for example a graphene nanoribbon. We establish a localization criterion involving properties on the group generated by transfer matrices. In particular, we consider not only the case where this group is the symplectic group but also a strict subgroup of it. We establish under quite general hypotheses that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents and the integrated density of states are H\"older continuous. Moreover, for a set of concrete cases where the potentials are on Pauli matrices, we compute the transfer matrices and prove either localization or delocalization, depending on the potential and on the parity of $N$.</description>

      <title>How to discretize continuous state-action spaces in Q-learning: A symbolic control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely recognized as an effective approach for synthesizing controllers to achieve specific goals. However, handling challenges posed by continuous state-action spaces remains an ongoing research focus. This paper presents a systematic analysis that highlights a major drawback in space discretization methods. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a symbolic model that represents behavioral relations, such as alternating simulation from abstraction to the controlled system. This relation allows for seamless application of the synthesized controller based on abstraction to the original system. Introducing a novel Q-learning technique for symbolic models, the algorithm yields two Q-tables encoding optimal policies. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these Q-tables serve as both upper and lower bounds on the Q-values of the original system with continuous spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the correlation between the parameters of the space abstraction and the loss in Q-values. The resulting algorithm facilitates achieving optimality within an arbitrary accuracy, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate learning parameters and refining the controller. The engineering relevance of the proposed Q-learning based symbolic model is illustrated through two case studies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>
