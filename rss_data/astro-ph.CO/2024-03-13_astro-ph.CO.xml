      <title>The XMM Cluster Survey: Automating the estimation of hydrostatic mass for large samples of galaxy clusters I -- Methodology, Validation, &amp; Application to the SDSSRM-XCS sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe features of the X-ray: Generate and Analyse (XGA) open-source software package that have been developed to facilitate automated hydrostatic mass ($M_{\rm hydro}$) measurements from XMM X-ray observations of clusters of galaxies. This includes describing how XGA measures global, and radial, X-ray properties of galaxy clusters. We then demonstrate the reliability of XGA by comparing simple X-ray properties, namely the X-ray temperature and gas mass, with published values presented by the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS), the Ultimate XMM eXtragaLactic survey project (XXL), and the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS). XGA measured values for temperature are, on average, within 1% of the values reported in the literature for each sample. XGA gas masses for XXL clusters are shown to be ${\sim}$10% lower than previous measurements (though the difference is only significant at the $\sim$1.8$\sigma$ level), LoCuSS $R_{2500}$ and $R_{500}$ gas mass re-measurements are 3% and 7% lower respectively (representing a 1.5$\sigma$ and 3.5$\sigma$ difference). Like-for-like comparisons of hydrostatic mass are made to LoCuSS results, which show that our measurements are $10{\pm}3%$ ($19{\pm}7%$) higher for $R_{2500}$ ($R_{500}$). The comparison between $R_{500}$ masses shows significant scatter. Finally, we present new $M_{\rm hydro}$ measurements for 104 clusters from the SDSS DR8 redMaPPer XCS sample (SDSSRM-XCS). Our SDSSRM-XCS hydrostatic mass measurements are in good agreement with multiple literature estimates, and represent one of the largest samples of consistently measured hydrostatic masses. We have demonstrated that XGA is a powerful tool for X-ray analysis of clusters; it will render complex-to-measure X-ray properties accessible to non-specialists.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES -- XII. Time-delay Measurements of Strongly Lensed Type Ia Supernovae using a Long Short-Term Memory Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are a promising probe to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$) directly. To use LSNe Ia for cosmography, a time-delay measurement between the multiple images, a lens-mass model, and a mass reconstruction along the line of sight are required. In this work, we present the machine learning network LSTM-FCNN which is a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and a fully-connected neural network (FCNN). The LSTM-FCNN is designed to measure time delays on a sample of LSNe Ia spanning a broad range of properties, which we expect to find with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and for which follow-up observations are planned. With follow-up observations in $i$ band (cadence of one to three days with a single-epoch $5\sigma$ depth of 24.5 mag), we reach a bias-free delay measurement with a precision around 0.7 days over a large sample of LSNe Ia. The LSTM-FCNN is far more general than previous machine learning approaches such as the Random Forest (RF), where a RF has to be trained for each observational pattern separately, and yet the LSTM-FCNN outperforms the RF by a factor of roughly three. Therefore, the LSTM-FCNN is a very promising approach to achieve robust time delays in LSNe Ia, which is important for a precise and accurate constraint on $H_0$</description>

      <title>A systematic study of projection biases in the Weak Lensing analysis of cosmic shear and the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a systematic study of projection biases in the Weak Lensing analysis of cosmic shear and the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using data collected during the first-year of running the Dark Energy Survey experiment. The study uses $\Lambda$CDM as the cosmological model and two-point correlation functions for the WL analysis. The results in this paper show that, independent of the WL analysis, projection biases of more than $1\sigma$ exist, and are a function of the position of the true values of the parameters $h$, $n_{s}$, $\Omega_{b}$, and $\Omega_{\nu}h^{2}$ with respect to their prior probabilities. For cosmic shear, and the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing, this study shows that the coverage probability of the $68.27\%$ credible intervals ranges from as high as $93\%$ to as low as $16\%$, and that these credible intervals are inflated, on average, by $29\%$ for cosmic shear and $20\%$ for the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing. The results of the study also show that, in six out of nine tested cases, the reduction in error bars obtained by transforming credible intervals into confidence intervals is equivalent to an increase in the amount of data by a factor of three.</description>

      <title>The 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Power Spectrum from eBOSS DR16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the three-dimensional power spectrum (P3D) of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) forest using the complete extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey data release 16 (eBOSS DR16). This sample consists of 205,012 quasar spectra in the redshift range 2 &lt;= z &lt;= 4 at an effective redshift z=2.334. We propose a pair-count spectral estimator in configuration space, weighting each pair by exp(ikr), for wave vector k and pixel pair separation r, effectively measuring the anisotropic power spectrum without the need for fast Fourier transforms. This accounts for the window matrix in a tractable way, avoiding artifacts found in Fourier-transform based power spectrum estimators due to the sparse sampling transverse to the line-of-sight of Ly-$\alpha$ skewers. We extensively test our pipeline on two sets of mocks: (i) idealized Gaussian random fields with a sparse sampling of Ly-$\alpha$ skewers, and (ii) log-normal LyaCoLoRe mocks including realistic noise levels, the eBOSS survey geometry and contaminants. On eBOSS DR16 data, the Kaiser formula with a non-linear correction term obtained from hydrodynamic simulations yields a good fit to the power spectrum data in the range 0.02 &lt;= k &lt;= 0.35 h/Mpc at the 1-2 sigma level with a covariance matrix derived from LyaCoLoRe mocks. We demonstrate a promising new approach for full-shape cosmological analyses of Ly-$\alpha$ forest data from cosmological surveys such as eBOSS, the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and future surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph, WEAVE-QSO and 4MOST.</description>

      <title>CMB spectral distortions from enhanced primordial perturbations: the role of spectator axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial tensor modes can induce Cosmic Microwave Background spectral distortions during horizon re-entry. We investigate a specific mechanism proposed for this purpose, characterized by the coupling of an SU(2) gauge field to an axion undergoing a momentary stage of rapid evolution during inflation. Examining also the scalar perturbations produced by this model, we find that spectral distortions from the scalar modes significantly dominate those arising from the tensors. This holds true also for an earlier version of the model based on a U(1) gauge field. The scalar-induced distortions might be observed in future experiments, and the current COBE/FIRAS constraints already limit the parameter space of these models. Additionally, we find that delaying the onset of fast roll in the SU(2) scenario (to enhance the modes at the scales relevant for spectral distortions, while respecting the CMB constraints at larger scales) poses a greater challenge compared to the U(1) case. We propose a way to control the axion speed by varying the size of its coupling to the gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Toward mapping turbulence in the intracluster medium III. Constraints on the turbulent power spectrum with Athena/X-IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Future X-ray observatories with high spectral resolution and imaging capabilities will enable measurements and mappings of emission line shifts in the intracluster medium (ICM). Such direct measurements can serve as unique probes of turbulent motions in the ICM. Determining the level and scales of turbulence will improve our understanding of the galaxy cluster dynamical evolution and assembly, together with a more precise evaluation of the non thermal support pressure budget. This will allow for more accurate constraints to be placed on the masses of galaxy clusters, among other potential benfits. Aims. In this view, we implemented the methods presented in the previous instalments of our work to characterize the turbulence in the ICM in a feasibility study with the X-IFU on board the future European X-ray observatory, Athena. Methods. From idealized mock observations of a toy model cluster, we reconstructed the second-order structure function built with the observed velocity field to constrain the turbulence. We carefully accounted for the various sources of errors to derive the most realistic and comprehensive error budget within the limits of our approach. With prior assumptions on the dissipation scale and power spectrum slope, we constrained the parameters of the turbulent power spectrum model through the use of MCMC sampling. Results. With favourable assumptions, we were able to retrieve the injection scale, velocity dispersion, and power spectrum slope, with 1sigma uncertainties better than ~15% of the input values. We demonstrated the efficiency of our carefully set framework to constrain the turbulence in the ICM from high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations, paving the way for more in-depth investigation of the optimal required observing strategy within a more restrictive observational setup with the future X-IFU instrument.</description>

      <title>Galaxy dispersion measured by Fast Radio Bursts as a probe of baryonic feedback models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a sensitive probe of the electron distribution in both the large-scale structure and their host galaxies through the dispersion measure (DM) of the radio pulse. Baryonic feedback models are crucial for modelling small scales for ongoing cosmological surveys that are expected to change the electron distribution in galaxies in a way that can be probed by FRB observations. In this paper, we explore the impact of baryonic feedback on FRB hosts using numerical simulations and make a detailed study of the host galaxy dispersion as a function of redshift, galaxy type, feedback model and how these properties vary in independent simulation codes. We find that the host galaxy dispersion varies dramatically between different implementations of baryonic feedback, allowing FRBs with host identification to be a valuable probe of feedback physics and thus provide necessary priors for upcoming analysis of the statistical properties of the large-scale structure.
  We further find that any dependency on the exact location of events within the halo is small. While there exists an evolution of the dispersion measure with redshift and halo mass, it is largely driven by varying star formation rates of the halo. Spectral information from FRB hosts can therefore be used to put priors on the host galaxy dispersion measure, and FRBs can be used to distinguish between competing models of baryonic feedback in future studies.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum non-Gaussian Covariance in Redshift Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an analytical description of the galaxy bispectrum covariance and the power spectrum-bispectrum cross-covariance in redshift space that captures the dominant non-Gaussian contributions. The Gaussian prediction for the variance of the halo bispectrum monopole significantly underestimates numerical estimates particularly for squeezed triangles, that is bispectrum triangular configurations where one side is much smaller than the other two, whereas the effect is relatively less important when considering the quadrupole. We propose an expression for the missing non-Gaussian contribution valid in the squeezed limit that requires an accurate modeling of the bispectrum alone. We validate our model against the numerical covariance estimated from a large suite of mock catalogs and find that it accurately predicts the variance as well as the dominant off-diagonal terms. We also present an expression for the cross-covariance between power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles and likewise find it to provide a good description of the numerical results.</description>

      <title>The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e &lt; m_\phi &lt; 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Testing photometric selection of emission-line galaxy targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object spectroscopic galaxy surveys typically make use of photometric and colour criteria to select targets. Conversely, the Euclid NISP slitless spectrograph will record spectra for every source over its field of view. Slitless spectroscopy has the advantage of avoiding defining a priori a galaxy sample, but at the price of making the selection function harder to quantify. The Euclid Wide Survey aims at building robust statistical samples of emission-line galaxies with fluxes in the Halpha-NII complex brighter than 2e-16 erg/s/cm^2 and within 0.9&lt;z&lt;1.8. At faint fluxes, we expect significant contamination by wrongly measured redshifts, either due to emission-line misidentification or noise fluctuations, with the consequence of reducing the purity of the final samples. This can be significantly improved by exploiting Euclid photometric information to identify emission-line galaxies over the redshifts of interest. To this goal, we compare and quantify the performance of six machine-learning classification algorithms. We consider the case when only Euclid photometric and morphological measurements are used and when these are supplemented by ground-based photometric data. We train and test the classifiers on two mock galaxy samples, the EL-COSMOS and Euclid Flagship2 catalogues. Dense neural networks and support vector classifiers obtain the best performance, with comparable results in terms of the adopted metrics. When training on Euclid photometry alone, these can remove 87% of the sources that are fainter than the nominal flux limit or lie outside the range 0.9&lt;z&lt;1.8, a figure that increases to 97% when ground-based photometry is included. These results show how by using the photometric information available to Euclid it will be possible to efficiently identify and discard spurious interlopers, allowing us to build robust spectroscopic samples for cosmological investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have a long history as possible phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, but are known to potentially produce deviations from the (strong) equivalence principle in systems involving self-gravitating objects, as a result of the presence of an additional gravitational scalar field besides the tensor modes of General Relativity. We describe here a novel mechanism whereby the equivalence principle is violated for an isolated rotating neutron star, if the gravitational scalar field is changing in time far from the system. We show that the neutron star rotational period changes due to an effective coupling ("angular momentum sensitivity") to the gravitational scalar, and compute that coupling for viable equations of state for nuclear matter. We comment on the relevance of our findings for testing scalar-tensor theories and models of ultralight dark matter with pulsar timing observations, a topic that we tackle in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>EIGER VI. The Correlation Function, Host Halo Mass and Duty Cycle of Luminous Quasars at $z\gtrsim6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expect luminous ($M_{1450}\lesssim-26.5$) high-redshift quasars to trace the highest density peaks in our universe, and therefore to reside in proto-clusters encompassing an abundance of galaxies in close vicinity. Here, we present observations of four $z\gtrsim6$ quasar fields using JWST/NIRCam in imaging and widefield slitless spectroscopy mode and report a wide range in the number of detected [OIII]-emitting galaxies in the quasars' environments, ranging between a density enhancement of $\delta&gt;100$ within a $2$ cMpc radius - one of the largest proto-clusters during the Epoch of Reionization discovered to date - to a density contrast consistent with zero, indicating the presence of a UV-luminous quasar in a region comparable to the average density of the universe. By measuring the two-point cross-correlation function of quasars and their surrounding galaxies, as well as the galaxy auto-correlation function, we infer a correlation length of quasars at $\langle z\rangle=6.25$ of $r_0^{\rm QQ}=21.3^{+2.7}_{-2.6}~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$, while we obtain a correlation length of the [OIII]-emitting galaxies of $r_0^{\rm GG}=4.2\pm0.1~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$. By comparing the correlation functions to dark-matter-only simulations we estimate the minimum mass of the quasars' host dark matter halos to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}/M_\odot)=12.30\pm0.14$ (and $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}^{\rm [OIII]}/M_\odot) = 10.72\pm0.03$ for the [OIII]-emitters), indicating that (a) luminous quasars do not necessarily reside within the most overdense regions in the early universe, and that (b) the UV-luminous duty cycle of quasar activity at these redshifts is $f_{\rm duty}\ll1$. Such short quasar activity timescales challenge our understanding of early supermassive black hole growth and provide evidence for highly dust-obscured growth phases or episodic, radiatively inefficient accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Observational tests in scale invariance II: gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the path of light rays passing near a massive object, in the context of the scale invariant equation of the geodesics first obtained by Dirac (1973). Using the exterior Schwarzschild solution for the metric, we derive the complete equations of the geodesics in the scale invariant context. We find that scale invariance introduces two additional terms to the Einstein term producing the deflection angle and that can potentially act over cosmological distances. Numerical integration of the scale-invariant geodesics, for the specific case of the z_L=1.94 lens galaxy in the extreme system JWST-ER1 (van Dokkum et al. 2023) shows that the two additional terms introduce only negligible effects, typically 1E-06 of the Einstein term. We conclude that the lensing deflection angle derived in Einstein's General Relativity is essentially independent of the scale invariant effects and that the photon's geodesics remain unchanged. We also explore the possible origin of the differences in the mass estimates from lensing and photometry in JWST-ER1 and in the SLACS galaxies, differences which appear larger at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Inflation and reheating in quadratic metric-affine gravity with derivative couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of metric-affine theories of gravity, where both the metric and connection are treated as independent variables, we consider actions quadratic in the Ricci scalar curvature coupled non-minimally to a scalar field through derivative couplings. Our analysis delves into the inflationary predictions, revealing their consistency with the latest observational constraints across a wide range of parameters. This compatibility permits adjustments such as an increase in the spectral index and a reduction in the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While we do not propose a specific reheating mechanism, our analysis demonstrates that within the quadratic model of inflation, the maximum reheating temperature can reach $\sim 3\times10^{15}\, {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure as a quantum effect in free-streaming in the cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure gets strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections are dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$, thereby mimicking a cosmological constant. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy velocities in clusters, rotation curves of galaxies, and "vertical" oscillations in the Milky Way currently show too high velocities with respect to the masses thought to be involved. While these velocity excesses are currently interpreted as the consequence of dark matter, it can also be naturally explained as a consequence of scale invariant theory, which rests on a very simple first principle: the addition of a new fundamental symmetry. In the present work, the case of scale invariance, present in General Relativity and Maxwell equations for the empty space without charge and current, is considered. Cosmological models predict a rapid decrease of these effects with increasing mean density up to the critical density, where they totally disappear. Starting from the scale invariant geodesic equation by Dirac (1973), for which a demonstration by an action principle is presented, a modified Newton equation is derived. The solutions of this equation are applied to clusters of galaxies, galactic rotation at different redshifts and "vertical" motions in the Milky Way. In this new framework, the convergence of theoretical predictions and observations, in different gravitational systems, epochs, mass range and spatial scales, opens interesting perspectives that deserve to be explored further.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity from the Cross-correlation of the Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Background and the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>

Abstract: Since the first LIGO/Virgo detection, Gravitational Waves (GWs) have been very promising as a new complementary probe to understand our Universe. One of the next challenges of GW search is the detection and characterization of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), that is expected to open a window on the very early Universe (cosmological background) and to provide us new information on astrophysical source populations (astrophysical background). One way to characterize the SGWB and to extract information about its origin is through the cross-correlation with other cosmological probes. To this aim, in this paper, we explore the cross-correlation between the astrophysical background anisotropies and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) ones. Such a signal is sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity (nG) through the GW bias. Thus, we study the capability of next generation space-based interferometers to detect such a cross-correlation signal and to constrain primordial nG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming experiments will map the spatial distribution of the 21-cm signal over three-dimensional volumes of space during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Several methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue of astrophysical foreground contamination in tomographic images of the 21-cm signal, one of which involves the excision of a wedge-shaped region in cylindrical Fourier space. While this removes the $k$-modes most readily contaminated by foregrounds, the concurrent removal of cosmological information located within the wedge considerably distorts the structure of 21-cm images. In this study, we build upon a U-Net based deep learning algorithm to reconstruct foreground wedge-removed maps of the 21-cm signal, newly incorporating light-cone effects. Adopting the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) as our fiducial instrument, we highlight that our U-Net recovery framework retains a reasonable level of reliability even in the face of instrumental limitations and noise. We subsequently evaluate the efficacy of recovered maps in guiding high-redshift galaxy searches and providing context to existing galaxy catalogues. This will allow for studies of how the high-redshift galaxy luminosity function varies across environments, and ultimately refine our understanding of the connection between the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxies during the EoR.</description>

      <title>Determining the Baryon Impact on the Matter Power Spectrum with Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The redistribution of baryonic matter in massive halos through processes like active galactic nuclei feedback and star formation leads to a suppression of the matter power spectrum on small scales. This redistribution can be measured empirically via the gas and stellar mass fractions in galaxy clusters, and leaves imprints on their electron density profiles. We constrain two semi-analytical baryon correction models with a compilation of recent Bayesian population studies of galaxy groups and clusters sampling a mass range above $\sim 3 \times 10^{13}$ $M_\odot$, and with cluster gas density profiles derived from deep, high-resolution X-ray observations. We are able to fit all the considered observational data, but highlight some anomalies in the observations. The constraints allow us to place precise, physically informed priors on the matter power spectrum suppression. At a scale of $k=1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ we find a suppression of $0.042^{+0.012}_{-0.014}$ ($0.049^{+0.016}_{-0.012}$), while at $k=3h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ we find $0.184^{+0.026}_{-0.031}$ ($0.179^{+0.018}_{-0.020}$), depending on the model used. In our fiducial setting, we also predict at 97.5 percent credibility, that at scales $k&lt;0.37h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ baryon feedback impacts the matter power less than $1\%$. This puts into question if baryon feedback is the driving factor for the discrepancy between cosmic shear and primary CMB results. We independently confirm results on this suppression from small-scale cosmic shear studies, while we exclude some hydro-dynamical simulations with too strong and too weak baryonic feedback. Our empirical prediction of the power spectrum suppression shows that studies of galaxy groups and clusters will be instrumental in unlocking the cosmological constraining power of future cosmic shear experiments like \textit{Euclid} and Rubin-LSST, and invites further investigation of the baryon correction models.</description>

      <title>Reheating constraints on modified quadratic chaotic inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reheating era of inflationary universe can be parameterized by various parameters like reheating temperature \(T_{\text{re}}\), reheating duration \(N_{\text{re}}\) and average equation of state parameter \(\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}\), which can be constrained by observationally feasible values of scalar power spectral amplitude \(A_{\text{s}}\) and spectral index \(n_{\text{s}}\). In this work, by considering the quadratic chaotic inflationary potential with logarithmic-correction in mass, we examine the reheating era in order to place some limits on model's parameter space. By investigating the reheating epoch using Planck 2018+BK18+BAO data, we show that even a small correction can make the quadratic chaotic model consistent with latest cosmological observations. We also find that the study of reheating era helps to put much tighter constraints on model and effectively improves accuracy of model.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy cosmologies with spatial curvature using Supernovae JWST forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological tensions, in particular, to infer the local value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, have developed new independent techniques to constrain cosmological parameters in several cosmologies. Moreover, even when the concordance Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained with local observables, its physics has shown deviations from a flat background. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a flat $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the $H_0$ value in tension with other techniques, in this paper we study new cosmological constraints in spatial curvature dark energy models. Additionally, to standard current Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) catalogs, we extend the empirical distance ladder method through an SNIa sample using the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to forecast SNIa up to $z \sim 6$, with information on the star formation rates at high redshift. Furthermore, we found that our constraints provide an improvement in the statistics associated with $\Omega_{m}$ when combining SNIa Pantheon and SNIa Pantheon+ catalogs with JW forecasting data.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed study of natural inflation with a periodic non-minimal coupling, which is a well-motivated inflationary model that admits an explicit UV completion. We demonstrate that this construction can satisfy the most recent observational constraints from Planck and the BICEP/Keck collaborations. We also compute the corresponding relic gravitational wave background due to tensor perturbations and show that future space-borne interferometers, such as DECIGO, BBO and ALIA, may be able to detect it. Next, we extend this analysis and establish the validity of these results in a multi-field model featuring an additional $R^2$ term in the action, which allows us to interpolate between natural and scalaron (a.k.a.~Starobinsky) inflation. We investigate the conditions under which the aforementioned future interferometers will have the capability to differentiate between pure natural inflation and natural-scalaron inflation. The latter analysis could open the door to distinguishing between single-field and multi-field inflation through gravitational wave observations in more general contexts.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations in the presence of photo-$z$ uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconstruction method has been widely employed to improve the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurement in spectroscopic survey data analysis. In this study, we explore the reconstruction of the BAO signals in the realm of photometric data. By adapting the Zel'dovich reconstruction technique, we develop a formalism to reconstruct the transverse BAO in the presence of photo-$z$ uncertainties \change{under the plane-parallel approximation}. We access the performance of the BAO reconstruction through comoving $N$-body simulations. The transverse reconstruction potential can be derived by solving a 2D potential equation, with the surface density and the radial potential contribution acting as the source terms. The solution is predominantly determined by the surface density. As is evident in dense samples, such as the matter field, the transverse BAO reconstruction can enhance both the strength of the BAO signals and their cross correlation with the initial conditions. At $z=0$, the cross correlation is increased by a factor of 1.2 at $ k_\perp = 0.2 \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}h $ and 1.4 at $ k_\perp = 0.3 \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}h $, respectively. We contrast the 2D potential results with the 3D Poisson equation solution, wherein we directly solve the potential equation using the position in photo-$z$ space, and find good agreement. Additionally, we examine the impact of various conditions, such as the smoothing scales and the level of photo-$z$ uncertainties, on the reconstruction results. We envision the straightforward application of this method to survey data.</description>

      <title>Under Einstein's Microscope: Measuring Properties of Individual Rotating Massive Stars From Extragalactic Micro Caustic Crossings</title>

Abstract: Highly magnified stars residing in caustic crossing lensed galaxies at z ~ 0.7-1.5 in galaxy cluster lensing fields inevitably exhibit recurrent brightening events as they traverse a micro caustic network cast down by foreground intracluster stars. The detectable ones belong to Nature's most massive and luminous class of stars, with evolved blue supergiants being the brightest ones at optical wavelengths. Considering single stars in this work, we study to what extent intrinsic stellar parameters are measurable from multi-filter lightcurves, which can be obtained with optical/near-IR space telescopes during one or multiple caustic crossing events. We adopt a realistic model for the axisymmetric surface brightness profiles of rotating O/B stars and develop a numerical lensing code that treats finite-source-size effects. With a single micro caustic crossing, the ratio of the surface rotation velocity to the breakup value is measurable to an precision of ~ 0.1-0.2 for feasible observation parameters with current space telescopes, with all unknown intrinsic and extrinsic parameters marginalized over and without a degeneracy with inclination. Equatorial radius and bolometric luminosity can be measured to 1/3 and 2/3 of the fractional uncertainty in the micro caustic strength, for which the value is not known at each crossing but an informative prior can be obtained from theory. Parameter inference precision may be further improved if multiple caustic crossing events for the same lensed star are jointly analyzed. Our results imply new opportunities to survey individual massive stars in star-formation sites at z ~ 0.7-1.5 or beyond.</description>

      <title>Cascades of high-energy SM particles in the primordial thermal plasma</title>

Abstract: High-energy standard model (SM) particles in the early Universe are generated by the decay of heavy long-lived particles. The subsequent thermalization occurs through the splitting of high-energy primary particles into lower-energy daughters in primordial thermal plasma. The principal example of such processes is reheating after inflation caused by the decay of inflatons into SM particles. Understanding of the thermalization at reheating is extremely important as it reveals the origin of the hot Universe, and could open up new mechanisms for generating dark matter and/or baryon asymmetry. In this paper, we investigate the thermalization of high-energy SM particles in thermal plasma, taking into account the Landau--Pomeranchuk--Migdal effect in the leading-log approximation. The whole SM particle content and all the relevant SM interactions are included for the first time, i.e., the full gauge interactions of SU(3)$_c\times$SU(2)$_L\times$U(1)$_Y$ and the top Yukawa interaction. The distribution function of each SM species is computed both numerically and analytically. We have analytically obtained the distribution function of each SM species after the first few splittings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, after a sufficient number of splittings, the particle distributions are asymptotic to certain values at low momentum, independent of the high-energy particles injected by inflaton decay. The results are useful to calculate the DM abundance produced during the pre-thermal phase. An example is provided to illustrate a way to calculate the DM abundance from the scattering between the thermal plasma and high-energy particles in the cascade.</description>

Abstract: The primordial clouds in the mini-halos hatch the first generation stars of the universe, which play a crucial role in cosmic evolution. In this paper, we investigate how the turbulence impacts the structure of primordial star-forming cloud. Previous cosmological simulations of the first star formation predicted a typical mass of around $\mathrm{ 100 \, M_\odot}$, which conflicts with recent observations of extremely metal-poor stars suggesting a lower mass scale of around $\mathrm{25 \, M_\odot}$. The discrepancy may arise from unresolved turbulence in the star-forming cloud, driven by primordial gas accretion during mini-halo formation in the previous simulation. To quantitatively examine the turbulence effect on the primordial cloud formation, we employ the adaptive mesh refinement code $\mathtt{Enzo}$ to model the gas cloud with primordial composition, including artificial-driven turbulence on the cloud scale and relevant gas physics. This artificial-driven turbulence utilizes a stochastic forcing model to mimic the unresolved turbulence inside mini-halos. Our results show that turbulence with high Mach number and compressional mode effectively fragments the cloud into several clumps, each with dense cores of $\mathrm{22.7 - 174.9 \, M_\odot}$ that undergo Jeans instability to form stars. Fragmentation caused by intense and compressive turbulence prevents the runaway collapse of the cloud. The self-bound clumps with smaller masses in turbulent primordial cloud suggest a possible pathway to decrease the theoretical mass scale of first stars, further reconciling the mass discrepancy between simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Second-order cosmological perturbations produced by scalar-scalar coupling during inflation stage</title>

Abstract: We study the perturbations up to the 2nd-order for a power-law inflation driven by a scalar field in synchronous coordinates. We present the 1st-order solutions, and analytically solve the 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation and scalar field equation, give the 2nd-order solutions for all the scalar, vector, and tensor metric perturbations, as well as the perturbed scalar field. During inflation, the 1st-order tensor perturbation is a wave and is decoupled from other perturbations, the scalar metric perturbation and the perturbed scalar field are coupled waves, propagating at the speed of light, differing from those in the dust and relativistic fluid models. The 1st-order vector perturbation is not wave and just decreases during inflation. The 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation is similar in structure to the 1st-order one, but various products of the 1st-order perturbations occur as the effective source, among which the scalar-scalar coupling is considered in this paper. The solutions of all the 2nd-order perturbations consist of a homogeneous part similar to the 1st-order solutions, and an inhomogeneous part in a form of integrations of the effective source. The 2nd-order vector perturbation is also a wave since the effective source is composed of the 1st-order waves. We perform the residual gauge transformations between synchronous coordinates up to the 2nd-order, and identify the 1st-order and 2nd-order gauge modes.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE: Resolving the End of Star Formation and Structure of AGN Accretion Disks from Cosmological Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently become possible to zoom-in from cosmological to sub-pc scales in galaxy simulations to follow accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, at some point the approximations used on ISM scales (e.g. optically-thin cooling and stellar-population-integrated star formation [SF] and feedback [FB]) break down. We therefore present the first cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation which self-consistently combines the FIRE physics (relevant on galactic/ISM scales where SF/FB are ensemble-averaged) and STARFORGE physics (relevant on small scales where we track individual (proto)stellar formation and evolution), together with explicit RMHD (including non-ideal MHD and multi-band M1-RHD) which self-consistently treats both optically-thick and thin regimes. This allows us to span scales from ~100 Mpc down to &lt;100 au (~300 Schwarzschild radii) around a SMBH at a time where it accretes as a bright quasar, in a single simulation. We show that accretion rates up to $\sim 10-100\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ can be sustained into the accretion disk at $\ll 10^{3}\,R_{\rm schw}$, with gravitational torques between stars and gas dominating on sub-kpc scales until star formation is shut down on sub-pc scales by a combination of optical depth to cooling and strong magnetic fields. There is an intermediate-scale, flux-frozen disk which is gravitoturbulent and stabilized by magnetic pressure sustaining strong turbulence and inflow with persistent spiral modes. In this paper we focus on how gas gets into the small-scale disk, and how star formation is efficiently suppressed.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Taiji to detect a gravitational-wave background from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations have presented compelling evidence for a stochastic signal at nanohertz frequencies, potentially originating from cosmic strings. Cosmic strings are linear topological defects that can arise during phase transitions in the early Universe or as fundamental strings in superstring theory. This paper focuses on investigating the detection capabilities of Taiji, a planned space-based gravitational wave detector, for the gravitational wave background generated by cosmic strings. By analyzing simulated Taiji data and utilizing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques, we demonstrate a significant improvement in precision compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data, surpassing it by an order of magnitude. This highlights the enhanced measurement capabilities of Taiji. Consequently, Taiji can serve as a valuable complementary tool to pulsar timing arrays in validating and exploring the physics of cosmic strings in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model For Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical-star formation simulations have resolved the formation of quasar accretion disks with Eddington or super-Eddington accretion rates onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) down to a few hundred gravitational radii. These 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks appear to be qualitatively distinct from classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks: the midplane pressure is dominated by toroidal magnetic fields with plasma $\beta \ll 1$ powered by advection of magnetic flux from the interstellar medium (ISM), and they are super-sonically and trans-Alfvenically turbulent with cooling times short compared to dynamical times yet remain gravitationally stable owing to magnetic support. In this paper, we present a simple analytic similarity model for such disks. For reasonable assumptions, the model is entirely specified by the boundary conditions (inflow rate at the BH radius of influence [BHROI]). We show that the scalings from this model are robust to various detailed assumptions, agree remarkably well with the simulations (given their simplicity), and demonstrate the self-consistency and gravitational stability of such disks even in the outer accretion disk (approaching the BHROI) at hyper-Eddington accretion rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view of recent interest in high-frequency detectors, broad features of gravitational wave signals from phase transitions taking place soon after inflation are summarized. The influence of the matter domination era that follows the slow-roll stage is quantified in terms of two equilibration rates. Turning to the highest-frequency part of the spectrum, we show how it is constrained by the fact that the bubble distance scale must exceed the mean free path.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of ions for light dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detection scheme is explored for light dark matter, such as axion dark matter or dark photon dark matter, using a Paul ion trap system. We first demonstrate that a qubit, constructed from the ground and first excited states of vibrational modes of ions in a Paul trap, can serve as an effective sensor for weak electric fields due to its resonant excitation. As a consequence, a Paul ion trap allows us to search for weak electric fields induced by light dark matter with masses around the neV range. Furthermore, we illustrate that an entangled qubit system involving $N$ ions can enhance the excitation rate by a factor of $N^2$. The sensitivities of the Paul ion trap system to axion-photon coupling and gauge kinetic mixing can reach previously unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Amplitudes in Power-Law FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlators of large-scale fluctuations belong to the most important observables in modern cosmology. Recently, there have been considerable efforts in analytically understanding the cosmological correlators and the related wavefunction coefficients, which we collectively call cosmological amplitudes. In this work, we provide a set of simple rules to directly write down analytical answers for arbitrary tree-level amplitudes of conformal scalars with time-dependent interactions in power-law FRW universe. With the recently proposed family-tree decomposition method, we identify an over-complete set of multivariate hypergeometric functions, called family trees, to which all tree-level conformal scalar amplitudes can be easily reduced. Our method yields series expansions and monodromies of family trees in various kinematic limits, together with a large number of functional identities. The family trees are in a sense generalizations of polylogarithms and do reduce to polylogarithmic expressions for the cubic coupling in inflationary limit. We further show that all family trees can be decomposed into linear chains by taking shuffle products of all subfamilies, with which we find simple connection between bulk time integrals and boundary energy integrals.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Initial Mass function in the Epoch of Reionization from Astrophysical and Cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [abridged] We aim to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) during the epoch of reionization. To this purpose, we build up a semi-empirical model for the reionization history of the Universe, based on various ingredients: the latest determination of the UV galaxy luminosity function from JWST out to redshift $z\lesssim 12$; data-inferred and simulation-driven assumptions on the redshift-dependent escape fraction of ionizing photons from primordial galaxies; a simple yet flexible parameterization of the IMF $\phi(m_\star)\sim m_\star^\xi\, e^{-m_{\star,\rm c}/m_\star}$ in terms of a high-mass end slope $\xi&lt;0$ and of a characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}$ below which a flattening or a bending sets in; the PARSEC stellar evolution code to compute the UV and ionizing emission from different star's masses as a function of age and metallicity; a few physical constraints related to stellar and galaxy formation in faint galaxies at the reionization redshifts. We compare our model outcomes with the reionization observables from different astrophysical and cosmological probes, and perform Bayesian inference on the IMF parameters. We find that the IMF slope $\xi$ is within the range from $-2.8$ to $-2.3$, while appreciably flatter slopes are excluded at great significance. However, the bestfit value of the IMF characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}\sim$ a few $M_\odot$ implies a suppression in the formation of small stellar masses, at variance with the IMF in the local Universe; this may be induced by the thermal background $\sim 20-30$ K provided by CMB photons at the reionization redshifts. Finally, we investigate the implications of our reconstructed IMF on the recent JWST detections of massive galaxies at and beyond the reionization epoch, showing that any putative tension with the standard cosmological framework is substantially alleviated.</description>
