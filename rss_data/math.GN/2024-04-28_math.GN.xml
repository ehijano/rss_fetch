      <title>Topological remarks on end and edge-end spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of ends in an infinite graph $G$ might be modified if we consider them as equivalence classes of infinitely edge-connected rays, rather than equivalence classes of infinitely (vertex-)connected ones. This alternative definition yields to the edge-end space $\Omega_E(G)$ of $G$, in which we can endow a natural (edge-)end topology. For every graph $G$, this paper proves that $\Omega_E(G)$ is homeomorphic to $\Omega(H)$ for some possibly another graph $H$, where $\Omega(H)$ denotes its usual end space. However, we also show that the converse statement does not hold: there is a graph $H$ such that $\Omega(H)$ is not homeomorphic to $\Omega_E(G)$ for any other graph $G$. In other words, as a main result, we conclude that the class of topological spaces $\Omega_E = \{\Omega_E(G) : G \text{ graph}\}$ is strictly contained in $\Omega = \{\Omega(H) : H \text{ graph}\}$.</description>

      <title>Network shell structure based on hub and non-hub nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shell structure holds significant importance in various domains such as information dissemination, supply chain management, and transportation. This study focuses on investigating the shell structure of hub and non-hub nodes, which play important roles in these domains. Our framework explores the topology of Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) networks, considering source node selection strategies dependent on the nodes' degrees. We define the shell $l$ in a network as the set of nodes at a distance $l$ from a given node and represent $r_l$ as the fraction of nodes outside shell $l$. Statistical properties of the shells are examined for a selected node, taking into account the node's degree. For a network with a given degree distribution, we analytically derive the degree distribution and average degree of nodes outside shell $l$ as functions of $r_l$. Moreover, we discover that $r_l$ follows an iterative functional form $r_l = \phi(r_{l-1})$, where $\phi$ is expressed in terms of the generating function of the original degree distribution of the network.</description>
