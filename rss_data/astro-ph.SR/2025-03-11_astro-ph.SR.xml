      <title>Unveiling stellar spin: Determining inclination angles in Be stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical properties of stellar atmospheres in rapidly rotating massive stars, such as Be stars, are critical to understanding their evolution and their role as progenitors of supernovae. These stars, which often have near-critical rotation, exhibit equatorial stretching and gravity darkening, which significantly complicates the determination of parameters such as the inclination angle. Be stars, characterized by their extreme rotational velocities, serve as excellent candidates for exploring these phenomena. However, fundamental quantities such as polar and equatorial radii and inclination angles are typically derived from interferometry, which applies only to a limited number of stars. This study aims to enhance the determination of inclination angles for Be stars using the ZPEKTR spectral synthesis code. By incorporating advanced models of gravity darkening and stellar deformation, we evaluated the effectiveness of this method with a sample of ten Be stars from the BeSOS database, comparing results with established interferometric data. Methods. We used the ZPEKTR code to model the effects of stellar oblateness and gravity darkening on spectral lines, focusing on the HeI 4471 line. We applied a chi-squared test minimization approach to identify the best-fitting models, and we evaluated the inclination angles derived against interferometric measurements. Our analysis reveals a robust linear correlation between the inclination angles derived from ZPEKTR and using interferometric techniques, which demonstrates an excellent agreement. The ZPEKTR code effectively models high rotational velocity effects, providing precise stellar parameter determinations. The results underscore the potential of advanced spectroscopic techniques to yield inclination measurements comparable to interferometry, which offers a pathway to studying distant massive stars.</description>

      <title>L1448 IRS3B: Dust Polarization Aligned with Spiral Features, Tracing Gas Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumstellar disk dust polarization in the (sub)millimeter is, for the most part, not from dust grain alignment with magnetic fields but rather indicative of a combination of dust self-scattering with a yet unknown alignment mechanism that is consistent with mechanical alignment. While the observational evidence for scattering has been well established, that for mechanical alignment is less so. Circum-multiple dust structures in protostellar systems provide a unique environment to probe different polarization alignment mechanisms. We present ALMA Band 4 and Band 7 polarization observations toward the multiple young system L1448 IRS3B. The polarization in the two Bands is consistent with each other, presenting multiple polarization morphologies. On the size scale of the inner envelope surrounding the circum-multiple disk, the polarization is consistent with magnetic field dust grain alignment. On the very small scale of compact circumstellar regions, we see polarization that is consistent with scattering around source a and c, which are likely the most optically thick components. Finally, we see polarization that is consistent with mechanical alignment of dust grains along the spiral dust structures, which would suggest that the dust is tracing the relative gas flow along the spiral arms. If the gas-flow dust grain alignment mechanism is dominant in these cases, disk dust polarization may provide a direct probe of the small-scale kinematics of the gas flow relative to the dust grains.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2011-BLG-0462: An Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Hole Confirmed Using New HST Astrometry and Updated Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-duration Galactic-bulge microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 produced relativistic astrometric deflections of the source star, which we measured using HST observations taken at 8 epochs over ~6 years. Analysis of the microlensing light curve and astrometry led our group (followed by other independent groups) to conclude that the lens is an isolated stellar-mass black hole (BH)--the first and only one unambiguously discovered to date. There have now been three additional epochs of HST observations, increasing the astrometric time baseline to 11 years. Additionally, the ground-based OGLE data have been updated. We have re-analyzed the data, including the new HST astrometry, and photometry obtained with 16 different telescopes. The source lies only 0.4 arcsec from a bright neighbor, making it crucial to perform precise subtraction of its point-spread function (PSF) in the astrometric measurements of the source. Moreover, we show that it is essential to perform a separate PSF subtraction for each individual HST frame as part of the reductions. Our final solution yields a lens mass of 7.15 +/- 0.83 solar mass. Combined with the lack of detected light from the lens at late HST epochs, the BH nature of the lens is conclusively verified. The BH lies at a distance of 1.52 +/- 0.15 kpc, and is moving with a space velocity of 51.1 +/- 7.5 km/s relative to the stars in the neighborhood. We compare our results with those of other studies and discuss reasons for the differences. We searched for binary companions of the BH at a range of separations but found no evidence for any.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Another one (BH+OB pair) bites the dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most (or possibly all) massive stars reside in multiple systems. From stellar evolution models, numerous systems with an OB star coupled to a black hole would be expected to exist. There have been several claimed detections of such pairs in recent years and this is notably the case of HD96670. Using high-quality photometry and spectroscopy in the optical range, we revisited the HD96670 system. We also examined complementary X-ray observations to provide a broader view of the system properties. The TESS light curves of HD96670 clearly show eclipses, ruling out the black hole companion scenario. This does not mean that the system is not of interest. Indeed, the combined analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data indicates that the system most likely consists of a O8.5 giant star paired with a stripped-star companion with a mass of ~4.5Msol, a radius of ~1Rsol, and a surface temperature of ~50kK. While several B+sdOB systems have been reported in the literature, this would be the first case of a Galactic system composed of an O star and a faint stripped star. In addition, the system appears brighter and harder than normal OB stars in the X-ray range, albeit less so than for X-ray binaries. The high-energy observations provide hints of phase-locked variations, as typically seen in colliding wind systems. As a post-interaction system, HD96670 actually represents a key case for probing binary evolution, even if it is not ultimately found to host a black hole.</description>

      <title>A census of OB stars within 1 kpc and the star formation and core collapse supernova rates of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OB stars are crucial for our understanding of Galactic structure, star formation, stellar feedback and multiplicity. In this paper we have compiled a census of all OB stars within 1 kpc of the Sun. We performed evolutionary and atmospheric model fits to observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) compiled from astro-photometric survey data. We have characterized and mapped 24,706 O- and B-type stars ($T_{\rm eff} &gt; 10,000$ K) within 1 kpc of the Sun, whose overdensities correspond to well-studied OB associations and massive star-forming regions such as Sco-Cen, Orion OB1, Vela OB2, Cepheus and Circinus. We have assessed the quality of our catalogue by comparing it with spectroscopic samples and similar catalogues of OB(A) stars, as well as catalogues of OB associations, star-forming regions and young open clusters. Finally, we have also exploited our list of OB stars to estimate their scale height (76 $\pm$ 1 pc), a local star formation rate of $2896^{+417}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ and a local core-collapse supernova rate of $\sim$15--30 per Myr. We extrapolate these rates to the entire Milky Way to derive a Galactic SFR of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a core-collapse supernova rate of 0.4--0.5 per century. These are slightly lower than previous estimates, which we attribute to improvements in our census of OB stars and changes to evolutionary models. We calculate a near-Earth core collapse supernova rate of $\sim$2.5 per Gyr that supports the view that nearby supernova explosions could have caused one or more of the recorded mass extinction events on Earth.</description>

      <title>Detection of the white-dwarf spin of V1082 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of circular polarization modulated with a period of 1.943 +- 0.002 h in the cataclysmic variable V1082 Sgr. These findings unambiguously reveal the rotation of a magnetic white dwarf and establish its intermediate polar (IP) nature. Along with its extraordinary long orbital period, Porb, of 20.8 h, the spin period (Pspin) places this system in an extreme position of the Pspin versus Porb distribution. The circular polarization phase diagram has a single peak and an amplitude smaller than 1%. These data were used to model the post-shock region of the accretion flow on the white-dwarf surface using the CYCLOPS code. We obtained a magnetic field in the white-dwarf pole of 11 MG and a magnetospheric radius consistent with the coupling region at around 2 - 3 white-dwarf radii. The Pspin/Porb value and the estimated magnetic field momentum suggest that V1082 Sgr could be out of spin equilibrium, in a spin-up state, possibly in a stream accretion mode.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- VI. Spectral Types and Properties of 51 Ultracool Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared spectra from the IRTF/SpeX and Blanco/ARCoIRIS telescope/instrument combinations are used for spectroscopic classification, to measure radial velocities and for the inference of astrophysical properties of 51 Gaia-selected nearby ultracool dwarfs. In this sample, 44 are newly classified in the near infrared. All but one of the UCDs are within 100 pc, and 37 lie within 50 pc. We find a total of 26 M-types, 24 L-types and one T-type in our sample. The positions of the majority of the UCDs on colour-magnitude diagrams and with evolutionary cooling track plots indicate that they are largely old and stellar in nature. There are a few UCDs of particular interest which lie away from expected trends, highlighting potential young, binary and thick disc/subdwarf UCDs. From spectral and kinematic analyses, we identify UCDs of particular interest for further investigation, including seven potentially young UCDs, three thick disc UCDs, one subdwarf, six wide binaries, and six unresolved binaries.</description>

      <title>Impact of $\textit{T}$- and $\rho$-dependent decay rates and new (n,$\gamma$) cross sections on the $\textit{s}$ process in low-mass AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of nuclear input related to weak-decay rates and neutron-capture reactions on predictions for the $s$ process in AGB stars. We provide the first database of surface abundances and stellar yields of the isotopes heavier than iron from the $Monash$ models. We run nucleosynthesis calculations with the $Monash$ post-processing code for 7 stellar structure evolution models of low-mass AGB stars with 3 different sets of nuclear input. The reference set has constant decay rates and represents the set used in the previous $Monash$ publications. The second set contains the temperature and density dependence of $\beta$ decays and electron captures based on the default rates of NETGEN. In the third set, we update 92 neutron-capture rates based on reevaluated experimental cross sections from the ASTRAL. We compare and discuss the predictions of each set relative to each other in terms of isotopic surface abundances and total stellar yields. We also compare results to isotopic ratios measured in presolar stardust SiC grains from AGB stars. The new sets of models resulted in a $\sim$66% solar $s$-process contribution to the $p$-nucleus $\mathrm{^{152}Gd}$, confirming that this isotope is predominantly made by the $s$ process. The nuclear input updates resulted in predictions for the $\mathrm{^{80}Kr/^{82}Kr}$ ratio in the He intershell and surface $\mathrm{^{64}Ni/^{58}Ni}, \mathrm{^{94}Mo/^{96}Mo}$ and $\mathrm{^{137}Ba/^{136}Ba}$ ratios more consistent with the corresponding ratios measured in stardust, however, the new predicted $\mathrm{^{138}Ba/^{136}Ba}$ ratios are higher than the typical values of the stardust SiC grain data. The W isotopic anomalies are in agreement with data from analysis of other meteoritic inclusions. We confirm that the production of $\mathrm{^{176}Lu}$ and $\mathrm{^{205}Pb}$ is affected by too large uncertainties in their decay rates from NETGEN.</description>

      <title>Observation of Alfven solitons in the solar corona using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.</description>

      <title>T CrA has a companion: First direct detection of T CrA B with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T CrA is a Herbig Ae-type young star in a complex circumstellar environment; it includes a circumstellar disk, accretion streamers, jets, and outflows. It has long been suspected to be a binary. However, until now, there has been no direct detection of a companion. Here we present new VLTI/MATISSE L- and N-band observations of T CrA taken between 2023 May and 2024 August with the aim of testing the binary nature of the system. We modeled the data with a geometric model using the Python tool oimodeler. We detected a companion (T CrA B) with a projected separation of $\Delta r = 153.2 \pm 1.2$ mas ($\approx 23$ au) toward the west direction at a position angle of $275.4 \pm 0.1^\circ$, in 2024 May-August. Our results support that the companion has a nearly edge-on orbit that is highly misaligned with respect to the circumprimary disk. Such a configuration could cause warping and tearing of the disk around the primary, which has been proposed by recent studies. In the L band the companion is extended, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) size of $\sim 1$ au, suggesting that the emission comes from a disk around the secondary star. The companion flux is 0.2-0.3 Jy in the L band, and 0.2-0.7 Jy in the N band, accounting for 4-20% of the total emission at those wavelengths. The SED of the companion is compatible with thermal radiation of warm dust (600-800 K).</description>

      <title>Birth of magnetized low-mass protostars and circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although protostars and disks are often studied separately owing to numerical and observational challenges, breakthroughs in recent years have highlighted the need to study both objects in concert. The role of magnetic fields in this regard must be investigated. We aim to describe the birth of the protostar and that of its disk, as well as their early joint evolution following the second collapse. We wish to study the structure of the nascent star-disk system, while focusing on the innermost sub-AU region. We carry out high resolution 3D RMHD simulations, describing the collapse of dense cloud cores to stellar densities. The calculations reach $\approx 2.3$ yr after protostellar birth. Our simulations are also compared to their hydro counterpart to better isolate the role of magnetic fields. When accounting for ambipolar diffusion, the efficiency of magnetic braking is drastically reduced and the nascent protostar reaches breakup velocity, thus forming a rotationally supported disk. The diffusion of the magnetic field also allows for the implantation of a $\sim \mathrm{kG}$ field in the protostar, which is thereafter maintained. The magnetic field is mainly toroidal in the star-disk system, although a notable vertical component threads it. We also show that the nascent disk is prone to the MRI, although our resolution is inadequate to capture the mechanism. We note a sensitivity of the disk's properties with regards to the angular momentum inherited prior to the second collapse, as well as the magnetic field strength. These calculations carry multiple implications on several issues in stellar formation theory, and offer perspectives for future modeling of the system. Should the fossil field hypothesis to explain the origins of magnetic fields in young stellar objects hold, we show that a $\sim \mathrm{kG}$ field strength may be implanted and maintained in the protostar at birth.</description>

      <title>DW Cnc: a micronova with a negative superhump and a flickering spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables have been known to show bursts driven by different physical mechanisms; however, the burst occurrence is much rarer than in their non-magnetic counterparts. DW Cnc is a well-studied intermediate polar that showed a burst with a 4-magnitude amplitude in 2007. Here we report on a recent burst in DW Cnc observed by ASAS-SN that reached a peak luminosity of 6.6 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg~s$^{-1}$, another 4 mag increase from its quiescent high state level. The released energy of the burst suggests that these are micronovae, a distinctive type of burst seen in magnetic systems that may be caused by a thermonuclear runaway in the confined accretion flow. Only a handful of systems, most of them intermediate polars, have a reported micronova bursts. We also report on the reappearance of the negative superhump of DW~Cnc as shown by TESS and OPTICAM data after the system emerges from its low state and immediately before the burst. We further report on a new phenomenon, where the spin signal turns "on" and "off" on the precession period associated with the negative superhump, which may indicate pole flipping. The new classification of DW Cnc as a micronova as well as the spin variability show the importance of both monitoring known micronova systems and systematic searches for more similar bursts, to limit reliance on serendipitous discoveries.</description>

      <title>Study of Open Star Clusters Using the Gaia DR3: I- Poorly Studied King 2 and King 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize photometric and kinematic data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and the {\sc ASteCA} package to analyze the sparsely studied open clusters, King 2 and King 5. For King 2, we identify 340 probable members with membership probabilities exceeding 50\%. Its mean proper motion components are determined as $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-1.407 \pm 0.008, -0.863 \pm 0.012)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its limiting radius is derived as $6.94_{-1.06}^{+0.22}$ arcminutes based on radial density profiles. The cluster has an estimated age of $4.80 \pm 0.30$ Gyr, a distance of $6586 \pm 164$ pc, and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.25$ dex ($z = 0.0088$). We detect 17 blue straggler stars (BSSs) concentrated in its core, and its total mass is estimated to be $356 \pm 19~M_{\odot}$. The computed apex motion is $(A_o,~D_o) = (-142^\circ.61 \pm 0^\circ.08, -63^\circ.58 \pm 0^\circ.13)$. Similarly, King 5 consists of 403 probable members with mean proper motion components $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-0.291 \pm 0.005, -1.256 \pm 0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and a limiting radius of $11.33_{-2.16}^{+5.45}$ arcminutes. The cluster's age is determined as $1.45 \pm 0.10$ Gyr, with a distance of $2220 \pm 40$ pc and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.15$ dex ($z = 0.0109$). We identify 4 centrally concentrated BSSs, and the total mass is estimated as $484 \pm 22~M_{\odot}$. The apex motion is calculated as $(A_o,~D_o) = (-115^\circ.10 \pm 0^\circ.09, -73^\circ.16 \pm 0^\circ.12)$. The orbital analysis of King 2 and King 5 indicates nearly circular orbits, characterized by low eccentricities and minimal variation in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. King 2 and King 5 reach maximum heights of $499 \pm 25$ pc and $177 \pm 2$ pc from the Galactic plane, respectively, confirming their classification as young stellar disc population.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Abundance Variations in the Milky Way's High-$\alpha$ Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using multi-element abundances from the SDSS APOGEE survey, we investigate the origin of abundance variations in Milky Way (MW) disk stars on the "high-$\alpha$ plateau," with $-0.8\leq\rm{[Fe/H]}\leq-0.4$ and $0.25\leq\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\leq0.35$. The elevated [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios of these stars imply low enrichment contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), but it is unclear whether their abundance patterns reflect pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) enrichment. We find that plateau stars with higher [Fe/Mg] ratios also have higher [X/Mg] ratios for other iron-peak elements, suggesting that the [Fe/Mg] variations in the plateau population do reflect variations in the SNIa/CCSN ratio. To quantify this finding, we fit the observed abundance patterns with a two-process model, calibrated on the full MW disk, which represents each star's abundances as the sum of a prompt CCSN process with amplitude $A_{\text{cc}}$ and a delayed SNIa process with amplitude $A_{\text{Ia}}$. This model is generally successful at explaining the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$, which are steeper for elements with a large SNIa contribution (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mn) and flatter for elements with low SNIa contribution (e.g., O, Si, Ca). Our analysis does not determine the value of [Mg/Fe] corresponding to pure CCSN enrichment, but it should be at least as high as the upper edge of the plateau at $\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\approx0.35$, and could be significantly higher. Compared to the two-process predictions, the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$ are steeper for (C+N) but shallower for Ce, providing intriguing but contradictory clues about AGB enrichment in the early disk.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Cosmic Neutrino Background Capture on Astrophysical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic background are captured by objects in the sky that contain material susceptible of single beta decay. Neutrons, which compose most of a neutron star, capture low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic neutrino background and release a high-energy electron in the MeV range. Also, planets contain unstable isotopes that capture the cosmic neutrinos. We show that this process is feasible and results in a non-negligible flux of electrons in the MeV range in neutron stars. We present a novel observable, the redshift evolution of the temperature of neutron stars due to neutrino capture, that could provide a route for detection of the cosmic neutrino background from future gravitational waves observatories. For planets the flux is significantly smaller and a measurement is not possible with currently envisioned technology. While the signature from neutron stars is small and challenging, it could result in a novel way to detect the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Identification of Star Clusters in M31 from PAndAS Images Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of star clusters holds significant importance in studying galaxy formation and evolution history. However, the task of swiftly and accurately identifying star clusters from vast amounts of photometric images presents an immense challenge. To address these difficulties, we employ deep learning models for image classification to identify young disk star clusters in M31 from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) images. For training, validation, and testing, we utilize the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey catalogs. We evaluate the performance of various deep learning models, using different classification thresholds and limiting magnitudes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet-50 model exhibits the highest overall accuracy. Moreover, using brighter limiting magnitudes and increasing the classification thresholds can effectively enhance the accuracy and precision of cluster identification. Through our experiments, we found that the model achieves optimal performance when the limiting magnitude is set to brighter than 21 mag. Based on this, we constructed a training dataset with magnitudes less than 21 mag and trained a second ResNet-50 model. This model achieved a purity of 89.30%, a recall of 73.55%, and an F1 score of 80.66% when the classification threshold was set to 0.669. Applying the second model to all sources in the PAndAS fields within a projected radius of 30 kpc from the center of M31, we identified 2,228 new unique star cluster candidates. We conducted visual inspections to validate the results produced by our automated methods, and we ultimately obtained 1,057 star cluster candidates, of which 745 are newly identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low masses of M dwarfs create attractive opportunities for exoplanet radial-velocity (RV) detections. These stars, however, exhibit strong stellar activity that may attenuate or mimic planetary signals. We present a velocimetric analysis on one such M dwarf, GJ 3998 ($d=18.2\,\text{pc}$), with two published short-period super-Earths: GJ 3998 b and GJ 3998 c. We use additional data from the HARPS-N spectrograph to confirm these two planets and to look for more. We carry out joint modelling of: (i) RV planetary signals, (ii) stellar rotation in RV and activity indicators through Gaussian processes, (iii) long-term trends in RV and activity indicators. We constrain the rotational period of GJ 3998 to $P_\text{rot}=30.2\pm 0.3\,\text{d}$ and discover long-term sinusoidal imprints in RV and FWHM of period $P_\text{cyc}=316^{+14}_{-8}\,\text{d}$. We confirm GJ 3998 b and GJ 3998 c, and detect a third planet: GJ 3998 d, whose signal had been previously attributed to stellar activity. GJ 3998 d has an orbital period of $41.78\pm 0.05\,\text{d}$, a minimum mass of $6.07^{+1.00}_{-0.96}\,\text{M}_\oplus$ and a mean insolation flux of $1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\,\Phi_\oplus$. This makes it one of the few known planets receiving Earth-like insolation flux.</description>

      <title>The Case for Edge-On Binaries: An Avenue Toward Comparative Exoplanet Demographics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most Sun-like and higher-mass stars reside in systems that include one or more gravitationally bound stellar companions. These systems offer an important probe of planet formation in the most common stellar systems, while also providing key insights into how gravitational perturbations and irradiation differences from a companion star alter the outcomes of planet formation. Recent dynamical clues have begun to emerge that reveal systematic, non-random structure in the configurations of many planet-hosting binary systems: in close- to moderate-separation ($s &lt; 800$ au) binary star systems, the orbits of exoplanets around individual stellar components are preferentially aligned with the orbital plane of their host stellar binary. In this work, we flip this narrative and search for nearby, edge-on binary star systems that, due to this preferential alignment, are top candidates for radial velocity and transiting exoplanet searches. We present a sample of 591 moderate-separation, relatively bright ($G &lt; 14$) Gaia-resolved binary star systems in likely near-edge-on configurations. Using a simulated population of exoplanets drawn from transit survey occurrence rate constraints, we provide an overview of the expected planet yields from a targeted search in these systems. We describe the opportunities for comparative exoplanet demographics in the case that both stars can be inferred to host edge-on planetary systems - a configuration toward which the presented sample may be biased, given recent observations of orbit-orbit alignment in exoplanet-hosting binary systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying systematic uncertainties in white dwarf cooling age determinations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooling ages of white dwarfs are routinely determined by mapping effective temperatures and masses to ages using evolutionary models. Typically, the reported uncertainties on cooling ages only consider the error propagation of the uncertainties on the spectroscopically or photometrically determined $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. However, cooling models are themselves uncertain, given their dependence on many poorly constrained inputs. This paper estimates these systematic model uncertainties. We use MESA to generate cooling sequences of $0.5-1.0 M_{\odot}$ hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores under different assumptions regarding the chemical stratification of their core, the thickness of their helium envelope, their hydrogen content, and the conductive opacities employed in the calculations. The parameter space explored is constrained by the range of values predicted by a variety of stellar evolution models and inferred from asteroseismological studies. For a $0.6 M_{\odot}$ white dwarf, we find an uncertainty of 0.03 Gyr at 10,000 K (corresponding to a 5% relative uncertainty) and 0.8 Gyr at 4000 K (9%). This uncertainty is significant, as it is comparable to the age uncertainty obtained by propagating the measurement errors on $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass for a typical white dwarf. We also separately consider the potential impact of $^{22}$Ne shell distillation, which plausibly leads to an additional uncertainty of $\sim 1$ Gyr for crystallized white dwarfs. We provide a table of our simulation results that can be used to evaluate the systematic model uncertainty based on a white dwarf's $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. We encourage its use in all future studies where white dwarf cooling ages are measured.</description>

Abstract: Understanding solar turbulent convection and its influence on differential rotation has been a challenge over the past two decades. Current models often overestimate giant convection cells amplitude, leading to an effective Rossby number too large and a shift towards an anti-solar rotation regime. This Convective Conundrum, underscores the need for improved comprehension of solar convective dynamics. We propose a numerical experiment in the parameter space that controls $Ro$ while increasing the Reynolds number ($Re$) and maintaining solar parameters. By controlling the Nusselt number ($Nu$), we limit the energy transport by convection while reducing viscous dissipation. This approach enabled us to construct a Sun-like rotating model (SBR97n035) with strong turbulence ($Re \sim 800$) that exhibits prograde equatorial rotation and aligns with observational data from helioseismology. We compare this model with an anti-solar rotating counterpart, and provide an in-depth spectral analysis to investigate the changes in convective dynamics. We also find the appearance of vorticity rings near the poles, which existence on the Sun could be probed in the future. The Sun-like model shows reduced buoyancy over the spectrum, as well as an extended quasi-geostrophic equilibrium towards smaller scales. This promotes a Coriolis-Inertia (CI) balance rather than a Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedes (CIA) balance, in order to favor the establishment of a prograde equator. The presence of convective columns in the bulk of the convection zone, with limited surface manifestations, also hints at such structures potentially occurring in the Sun.</description>

      <title>A Spectroastrometric Study of the Low-velocity Wind from DG Tau A</title>

Abstract: We obtained high spectral resolution spectra ($\Delta v$ $\sim$ 2.5 km s$^{-1}$) for DG Tau A from 4800 \r{A} to 7500 \r{A} using Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the first time. The low-velocity components (LVCs, |$v$| &lt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) were observed in the [O I] 5577, 6300, 6364 \r{A}, [S II] 6716, 6731 \r{A} lines. The offset position spectra observed in the LVCs show a "negative velocity gradient", supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind associated with the LVC emission. The offset position spectra observed in a component within the LVC velocity range between -16 km s$^{-1}$ to -41 km s$^{-1}$, namely, LVC-M, show a "negative velocity gradient'', supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind. With 12-70 au wind lengths measured using spectroastrometry, we estimate a lower limit to the wind mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In addition to the LVCs, we identify two high-velocity components (HVCs, |$v$| &gt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the collimated jet in 26 lines ([N I], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, He I). The one with a clear spatial offset from the star ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC1) is associated with an internal shock surface of the jet, while the other at the base ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC2) may be a stationary shock component. We find that the observed line profiles and the spatial scales of the LVC emission do not agree with the existing predictions for photoevaporative or magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds. These could be explained by the X-wind model, but synthetic observations are required for detailed comparisons.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the world's leading instrument for high-resolution imaging of the 0.3 to 10 mm wavelength sky. This interferometer exemplifies successful international collaboration even down to its individual components, including its telescope dishes and receivers produced in global partnerships. Over the past roughly ten years of ALMA operation, these receivers have been responsible for nearly ten thousand publications, as carefully monitored by the online ALMA Science Archive. However, the citations of the relevant receiver papers have not managed to grow together with their use in the astronomical community, which points out an information gap among the astronomical community. To overcome this gap, this memo provides a comprehensive list of receiver references, which was created in direct contact with the receiver groups.</description>

      <title>Muon collider probes of Majorana neutrino dipole moments and masses</title>

Abstract: Majorana neutrinos may have transitional dipole moments, which violate lepton number as well as lepton flavour. We estimate the sensitivity of future colliders to the electron-muon neutrino dipole moment, $\lambda_{e\mu}$, by considering same-sign dilepton final states. We find that hadron colliders, even the proposed FCC-hh, are sensitive only to $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\gtrsim 10^{-9}\mu_B$ (with $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton), a value two-three orders of magnitude larger than current bounds from astrophysics and low-energy neutrino-scattering experiments. In the case of a future muon collider, we show that the sensitivity varies from $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\sim 5\cdot 10^{-9}\mu_B$ for energy $\sqrt{s}\simeq 3$ TeV, to $\sim 10^{-12}\mu_B$ for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 50$ TeV, matching the current laboratory bounds for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 30$ TeV. The singular advantage of the muon collider signal would be a direct, clean identification of lepton number and flavour violation. We also show that a muon collider would improve by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on $m_{e\mu}$ and $m_{\mu\mu}$, two of the entries of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix. These bounds could be as strong as $\sim 50$ keV, still far above the neutrino mass scale.</description>

      <title>Investigating C-D out-of-plane vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13444</link>

Abstract: Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.</description>

      <title>The GALAH Survey: Data Release 4</title>

Abstract: The stars of the Milky Way carry the chemical history of our Galaxy in their atmospheres as they journey through its vast expanse. Like barcodes, we can extract the chemical fingerprints of stars from high-resolution spectroscopy. The fourth data release (DR4) of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey, based on a decade of observations, provides the chemical abundances of up to 32 elements for 917 588 stars that also have exquisite astrometric data from the $Gaia$ satellite. For the first time, these elements include life-essential nitrogen to complement carbon, and oxygen as well as more measurements of rare-earth elements critical to modern-life electronics, offering unparalleled insights into the chemical composition of the Milky Way.
  For this release, we use neural networks to simultaneously fit stellar parameters and abundances across the whole wavelength range, leveraging synthetic grids computed with Spectroscopy Made Easy. These grids account for atomic line formation in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium for 14 elements. In a two-iteration process, we first fit stellar labels to all 1 085 520 spectra, then co-add repeated observations and refine these labels using astrometric data from $Gaia$ and 2MASS photometry, improving the accuracy and precision of stellar parameters and abundances. Our validation thoroughly assesses the reliability of spectroscopic measurements and highlights key caveats.
  GALAH DR4 represents yet another milestone in Galactic archaeology, combining detailed chemical compositions from multiple nucleosynthetic channels with kinematic information and age estimates. The resulting dataset, covering nearly a million stars, opens new avenues for understanding not only the chemical and dynamical history of the Milky Way, but also the broader questions of the origin of elements and the evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies.</description>

      <title>SN 2024iss: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Implications for a Yellow Supergiant Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the multi-band photometric observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2024iss with ultra-violet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths starting one day after the explosion. The UV and optical light curves show the first peak two days after the explosion date. Following a first peak, a secondary maximum is observed in the optical and NIR bands, similar to SNe IIb with double-peaked light curves. The quasi-bolometric light curve shows the fast decay until a week after the explosion. From the analysis of the bolometric light curve, the ejecta mass and kinetic energy are estimated to be $M_{ej}=2.8\pm0.6~M_{\odot}$ and $E_{kin}=9.4\pm4.1\times10^{50}$ erg. The mass of the radioactive $^{56}$Ni is estimated to be $M(^{56}Ni)=0.2~M_{\odot}$. Fitting a black-body function to the spectral energy distribution reveals that the photospheric temperature exhibits a rapid exponential decline during the first week after the explosion. An analytic model describing the cooling emission after shock breakout provides a reasonable explanation for the observed temperature evolution. From these ejecta parameters, we calculated the progenitor radius to be $R_{pro}=50-340$~$R_{\odot}$. We conclude that these explosion properties are consistent with a core-collapse explosion from a yellow supergiant (YSG) progenitor.</description>
