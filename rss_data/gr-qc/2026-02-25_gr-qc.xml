      <title>Likelihood-Based One-Class Scoring in CWT Latent Space for Confusion-Limited LISA Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-class scoring for resolvable-source detection in confusion-limited LISA time-series data represented as continuous-wavelet-transform (CWT) scalograms. With data generation and preprocessing held fixed, we benchmark geometry-style scoring against likelihood-style latent-density scoring, while also evaluating morphology-augmented and contrastive variants. Geometry-only and geometry+morphology methods provide modest gains over the reconstruction baseline, and contrastive variants do not show stable improvement. Likelihood scoring on AE latents is consistently stronger: across three seeds, latent-only likelihood reaches ROC-AUC $0.8555\pm 0.0181$ and PR-AUC $0.9219 \pm 0.0118$, versus ROC-AUC $0.7663 \pm 0.0450$ and PR-AUC $0.8667 \pm 0.0255$ for AE+manifold. These results indicate that explicit latent density modeling can outperform local off-manifold distance in this confusion-limited regime. We provide seed-based comparisons, unified ROC/PR visual summaries, and reproducible experimental artifacts to support follow-on work in LISA anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous particle creation by oscillating compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theory predicts that dynamical curved spacetimes can spontaneously excite particle pairs from the quantum vacuum, a phenomenon extensively studied in expanding universes and in scenarios involving gravitational collapse. In this article, we explore particle creation driven by radial oscillations of 3+1-dimensional spherically symmetric compact objects, such as neutron stars, using a massless, minimally coupled scalar field as a reference model. We employ a toy model to describe the oscillatory dynamics and its coupling to the field modes, focusing on the resulting effects in the exterior spacetime of the star. The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions. This allows us to determine the full particle spectrum and the total particle number in the strong-field and fully relativistic regime. Our analysis confirms the existence of particle creation in this setting and, crucially, reveals a distinct resonance structure in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>A strongly hyperbolic viscous relativistic hydrodynamics theory with first-order charge current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the first order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics model of Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha- Kovtun (BDNK) in order to include the charge number current in full first order expansion with out-of-equilibrium contribution proportional to the evolution equation of the ideal fluid. We obtain a fully second order system of partial differential equation (PDE) that can be casted in a fully conservative way. We analyze the hyperbolicity of this model coupled to Einstein field equations using a newly developed technique that allows for hyperbolicity studies without explicit first order reduction. Furthermore, we identify a frame choice where our formulation is causal, stable and with positive entropy generation for a wide range of equations of state (EoS). Our analysis shows that the inclusion of an out-of-equilibrium correction to the charge current, plays an important role in guaranteeing the strong hyperbolicity and, therefore, the well-posedness of the system. If such correction is not applied, an extra frame restriction must be added to the present in the literature in order to obtain a strongly hyperbolic system.</description>

      <title>Tests of general relativity in pseudo-Newtonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potentials can reproduce classic tests of general relativity without resorting to full general relativistic formalisms. This is useful for the researchers seeking intuitive insight into relativistic gravity. Focusing on the perihelion precession of Mercury, gravitational redshift, and gravitational light bending, we derive analytical expressions for orbital precession and demonstrate that, with suitable physically acceptable parameters, pseudo-Newtonian approaches can accurately reproduce the observed perihelion advance and gravitational redshift. However, we confirm that no single potential consistently captures all relativistic effects. In particular, while certain parameters yield agreement with general relativity for planetary motion and redshift, they fail to reproduce gravitational lensing over a broad range of impact parameters. Our results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of pseudo-Newtonian methods in modeling gravitational phenomena. Although the pseudo-Newtonian approach cannot serve as universal substitutes for general relativity, especially in strong-field regimes, it provides valuable semi-analytical insight and pedagogical simplicity. Our results indicate the usefulness of the pseudo-Newtonian approach to uncover more complicated phenomena involved with strong field gravity in possibly modification to general relativity.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Newtonian potential for accretion disks in a modified gravity spacetime around the black hole and underlying properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a pseudo-Newtonian potential (PNP) corresponding to a rotating black hole solution in a modified gravity (MGR) framework using a metric-based prescription. The motivation is to enable realistic accretion disk studies in MGR, where full relativistic MHD simulations remain computationally prohibitive. Effective potentials and the underlying Newtonian-like forces are derived for both massive and massless particles in the equatorial plane, relevant for disk dynamics. The reliability of the PNP is tested by comparing key orbital properties -- marginally stable, marginally bound, photon orbits and energies at marginally stable orbit radii -- with exact MGR predictions. The PNP reproduces the marginally stable and photon orbits exactly, while marginally bound orbits and specific energies deviate by less than about 7-10%. The influence of the MGR parameter on particle dynamics and effective potentials is analyzed, revealing non-trivial departures from simple Newtonian intuition. The study demonstrates that the proposed PNP accurately captures essential spatial properties of MGR spacetime and provides an efficient, physically consistent tool for investigating accretion phenomena and strong-gravity astrophysics beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm Effect for Cooper Pairs in Kerr Spacetime: Gravitomagnetic Phase Shifts from Frame Dragging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains among the most profound challenges in fundamental physics. Here we investigate a novel quantum probe of strong-field gravity: the gravitomagnetic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for Cooper pairs propagating in Kerr spacetime. The frame-dragging induced by a rotating black hole (BH) generates an effective vector potential through the off-diagonal metric component $g_{t\phi}$, which couples to the macroscopic phase of the superconducting condensate. We derive the gauge-invariant AB phase shift $\Delta\theta = (4\pi m^* Ma/\hbar)(1/r_2 - 1/r_1)$ for an interferometer with arms at radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $m^* = 2m_e$ is the Cooper pair mass and $a$ is the BH spin parameter. Remarkably, the predicted phases reach $|\Delta\theta| \sim 10^{24}$ radians for Sgr~A* and $\sim 10^{27}$ radians for M87*, reflecting the enormous gravitomagnetic flux near supermassive BHs. We analyze the dependence on interferometer geometry, demonstrate that tidal disruption of Cooper pairs is negligible at distances $r \gtrsim 10\,r_s$, and establish connections to the geometric Berry phase. Although direct experimental realization remains beyond current technology due to the vast distances involved, our framework provides quantitative predictions linking quantum coherence to spacetime curvature, complementing recent observations of gravitational AB phases in atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>A note on the conceptual problems on the Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief note is written with a somewhat similar purpose to Earman's 2011 paper on the conceptual problems on the Unruh effect. However, we confine ourselves to Sewell's modular approach to the Unruh effect, which is based on the theorems of Tomita-Takesaki and Bisognano-Wichmann. This approach is rigorous, and has an advantage of being model-independent. However, we will see that a number of conceptual problems remain unsolved on this approach.</description>

      <title>Complex Inflaton Potentials with Nonminimal Coupling: Robust Inflation and Geometric Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an inflationary scenario driven by a complex scalar field nonminimally coupled to gravity and subject to a non-symmetric complex potential. The real part of the potential controls the cosmological background and realizes a plateau-type inflation compatible with $\alpha$-attractor $\mathrm{T}$-models, while the imaginary part acts as an effective non-Hermitian deformation encoding dissipative effects. Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics. Numerical integration shows that the duration of inflation is primarily controlled by the nonminimal coupling $\zeta$, whereas the complex asymmetry parameter $\Delta\varepsilon$ has a negligible impact on the real background: the real energy density and pressure vary by less than $10^{-5}$ as $\Delta\varepsilon$ is scanned over its allowed range. Mapping the two-field dynamics to an effective single-field description in the Einstein frame, we obtain a spectral index $n_s\simeq 0.968-0.971$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r&lt;10^{-3}$, fully consistent with Planck 2018 bounds. We introduce a relevance parameter and show that non-Hermitian effects remain strongly suppressed during slow roll but grow to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ near the end of inflation, triggering an efficient reheating phase without additional fields or {\it ad hoc} friction terms. In this sense, the imaginary sector behaves as an effective $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric channel for energy transfer, providing a geometrical mechanism for inflation and its exit within a non-Hermitian scalar-tensor framework.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Gravity with Non-Extensive Horizon Entropy and Topological Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of gravitational dynamics in the presence of generalized, non-extensive horizon entropies. Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.
  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = \eta (A/4G)^\delta$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(\chi) \propto |\chi|^{1-\delta}$ where $\chi$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-\delta|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology. The framework thus provides a controlled route to confront non-extensive horizon thermodynamics with both theoretical consistency requirements and observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole's Resonant Scattering: Absorption and Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigate scalar superradiant scattering in the rotating dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Starting from the separable Klein-Gordon equation for a massive neutral scalar field, we work in the low-frequency and slow-rotation regime and employ the analytical asymptotic matching (AAM) method to compute the reflection coefficient and the associated superradiant amplification factor. Since an exact global scattering solution is not available in this four-charge geometry, the AAM framework enables a controlled analytic treatment of the near-and far-region dynamics. We provide detailed and systematic derivations of the matching procedure leading to the closed-form amplification formula. The superradiant condition is obtained explicitly and we demonstrate that energy extraction occurs exclusively for co-rotating modes satisfying $\Omega &lt; m \Omega_H$. We show that the presence of electric and magnetic charges suppresses the amplification relative to the Kerr limit, whereas lighter co-rotating scalar fields broaden the superradiant window and enhance the efficiency of rotational energy extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of the Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) vacuum solution is characterized as the unique Petrov Type D vacuum metric such that the two double principal null directions form an integrable distribution. We study expanding and twisting non-vacuum Type D metrics in this geometry, with the additional assumption $\Phi_{01}=\Phi_{12}=0$. We prove that these conditions determine the solutions up to a freedom in $\Phi_{11}\pm 3\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Imprints of the Lorentz-symmetry breaking on the precessing jet nozzle of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximately 11-year jet precession period observed in M87* strongly suggests that the supermassive rotating black hole with a tilted accretion disk, which could provide a powerful constraint for confining the parameters of black hole. In this paper, our aim is to utilize the observations of M87* to preliminarily constrain the parameters of the rotating black hole in Bumblebee gravity by modeling the motion of the tilted accretion disk particle with the spherical orbits. We compute spherical orbits and ISSOs, demonstrating that the conserved quantities energy $\mathcal{E}$, angular momentum $\mathcal{L}$, and Carter constan $\mathcal{K}$ depend on $(r,a,\ell,\zeta)$, exhibiting distinct behaviors for prograde and retrograde orbits. For prograde orbits, the ISSO radius $r_{ISSO}$ decreases with spin parameter $a$ and LSB parameter $\ell$ and increases with the tilt angular $\zeta$, whereas the opposite trends occur for retrograde orbits. Angular analysis shows that $\theta$ oscillates within $(\pi/2-\zeta, \pi/2+\zeta)$, while $\phi$ increases approximately linearly, enabling the determination of the oscillation period $T_\theta$, azimuthal accumulation $\phi(T_\theta)/\pi$, and precession angular velocity $\omega_t$. Using the observed jet precession period $T=11.24 \pm 0.47$ years with a fixed tilt $\zeta=1.25^\circ$, the warp radius $r/M$ ranges from $(5.73,25.15)$ for prograde and $(6.16,26.46)$ for retrograde orbits, increasing with $a$ or $\ell$. Comparisons with Kerr limits ($r/M=14.12$ prograde, $16.1$ retrograde) suggest that $r/M&gt;16$ may indicate a non-vacuum Bumblebee vector field. Incorporating the EHT shadow $\theta_{sh}=42\pm3\mu$as further constrains $r/M$ to $(5.82,22.61)$ and $(6.17,24.74)$, with discrepancies of $0.05\sim1.96$.</description>

      <title>Ringing Regularity: Gravitational Perturbations and Quasinormal Modes of Einasto-Supported Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate axial gravitational perturbations and quasinormal modes of regular black holes supported by an Einasto distribution of matter. Halo matter not only removes the central singularity but also modifies the quasinormal spectrum. We show that the resulting quasinormal spectrum deviates systematically from the Schwarzschild case, with shifts in both oscillation frequencies and damping rates that grow with the halo scale parameter and the Einasto index. In near-extremal configurations, the damping rate can be significantly suppressed, leading to long-lived modes. The effects of regularity and environmental factors on the spectrum are found to be substantially larger than the estimated numerical uncertainty, as confirmed independently by high-order WKB calculations with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave radiation from periodic orbits in regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave radiation from periodic orbits in some standard regular black hole spacetimes is studied, primarily using known methods (numerical and analytic). We demonstrate specific differences with the singular Schwarzschild geometry by analysing orbit characteristics, gravitational wave strain profiles, and the corresponding power spectrum density, for different values of the regularising parameter `$g$'. Further, we assess our results vis-a-vis the LISA sensitivity curves and show how our results may be useful while developing templates for detecting regular black holes as viable alternatives to the singular ones. The appendices to our article contain details on errors in our estimates and provide for the first time, some exact analytical expressions on gravitational wave radiation from different types of periodic orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Internal dynamics and guided motion in general relativistic quantum interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between internal degrees of freedom of quantum systems and their overall motion in an external gravitational field plays a central role in multiple extensions of Einstein's equivalence principle to quantum physics. While previous models of such effects were predominantly restricted to linearized gravity and often required the motion of quantum particles to follow prescribed world-lines, this letter shows how such phenomena can be understood using generally covariant semiclassical approximations in the framework of quantum field theory in curved space-times. This method provides a unification and generalization of previously established results, but also predicts new effects such as an influence of internal energies on field amplitudes, as well as correction terms to the internal Schr\"odinger equation that give rise to Berry phases.</description>

      <title>5PN eccentric waveforms for intermediate-mass-ratio-inspirals (IMRIs) from post-Newtonian and black hole perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves from compact binaries involving at least one intermediate mass black hole, and component mass ratios in the range $0.1$-$10^{-4}$, are among the primary sources for future space detectors with target strain sensitivities in the deci-Hertz (dHz) band. Tuned to the waveform requirements for analyzing such sources, a hybrid model is obtained by combining waveforms from the post-Newtonian (PN) and black hole perturbation (BHP) theory. Components of the binary are assumed to be nonspinning and on eccentric orbits. This hybrid model is 3PN accurate in terms of results from PN theory and 5PN in results from BHP theory. In terms of eccentricity, corrections through the order $\mathcal{O}(e^{10})$ are included. Further, using number of gravitational wave cycles estimates for a few representative binaries observable in the dHz band, we demonstrate the significance of the mass ratio information from the PN approach, of contributions from the BHP theory at high PN orders, and also of higher order eccentricity corrections. In particular, we find an almost 10-fold increase in number of gravitational wave cycles for a fixed mass ratio of 0.1 and $e_0\sim0.3$ (evaluated at $0.01$Hz) when contributions beyond the leading order in eccentricity are accounted for. We also confirm the requirement to go beyond 5PN order in the circular part of the waveform from BHP theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light crossing dark domain walls that source a top form coupled to gauge Chern--Simons terms mixing visible and dark $U(1)$ gauge fields generically converts into dark photons. The effect is entirely localized on the wall and requires no additional ingredients. The conversion rate is a sharp function of the photon frequency in the wall rest frame, vanishing above the ultraviolet cutoff of the top form sector. Partial cloaking may also induce a rotation of the polarization of transmitted light of order $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3}$ radians, modify the cosmic microwave background power spectrum, and violate Etherington's reciprocity relation at low frequencies. These effects can impact cosmological determinations of the Hubble rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new class of perturbative asymptotically Anti-de Sitter pp-wave spacetimes by performing a long-wavelength expansion of Kaigorodov metrics in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Holographically, these spacetimes are described by a null fluid hydrodynamic expansion around null states in the conformal field theory, which can be obtained as zero temperature and infinite momentum limits of finite temperature states. Building on this, we explicitly show that special cases of this null fluid/gravity correspondence can be obtained as an ultra-relativistic limit of the usual fluid/gravity correspondence in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow approaches the speed of light. We also extend these results to the context of the blackfold approach in which the corresponding pp-wave spacetimes are asymptotically flat and can be obtained as infinite temperature limits of boosted black branes.</description>

      <title>Neural Bayesian updates to populations with growing gravitational-wave catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational-wave catalogs grow, they will become increasingly computationally expensive to analyze in their entirety, especially when inferring astrophysical source populations with high-dimensional, flexible models. Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches.</description>

      <title>Coherent quantum hairy black holes from gravitational decoupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum description of hairy black holes within gravitational decoupling (GD) is developed using coherent graviton states. Classical geometry emerges as the mean-field limit of a finite graviton condensate, while quantum fluctuations introduce a short-distance regulator. We construct a coherent quantum GD hairy black hole metric by Gaussian smearing the gravitational potential, with an effective width that encodes the size of the quantum core. The resulting geometry is free of curvature singularities over appropriate parameter ranges and exhibits modified horizon structures. The effective stress-energy tensor is derived, the energy conditions are analyzed, and the Misner-Sharp mass is computed. We investigate geodesics in the coherent quantum GD hairy black hole geometry, with relevant deviations from the RN case. Photon rings, critical impact parameters, and light deflection exhibit measurable strong-field modifications, allowing observational constraints on deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Is a covariant virtual tachyon viable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sidney Coleman has noted that superluminal particles or observers would be able to go back in time and have no definite trajectory according to subluminal observers, while not violating Lorentz invariance [1]. Recently, Dragan and Ekert have significantly developed similar ideas even further, which lead to formulation of ``quantum principle of relativity'' that intimately links the two theories [2]. However, field theory descriptions of an on-shell tachyon, described by scalar field $\phi$ with negative mass squared parameter, lead to violation of basic principles of relativity or quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate whether purely virtual tachyons can be consistent within the fakeon framework-the only known viable formulation of purely virtual particles. We identify two fatal obstructions. First, Lorentz boosts mix creation and annihilation operators, rendering the canonical commutation relations non-invariant despite formal invariance of the vacuum. Second, the real part of the tachyon Feynman propagator and Wheeler propagator have disjoint support, preventing application of both the fakeon prescription and Wheeler-Feynman absorber mechanism. Interactions with stable Standard Model fields further violate Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle, and we provide quantitative limit on coupling strength of such scenario. Our analysis excludes possibility of formulating covariant quantum field theory of interacting virtual tachyons.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the Lyth Bound with Entangled Gravitons: Primordial Signatures and Late-Time Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum entanglement between primordial gravitons in dynamically decoupled gravitational sectors can parametrically enhance the tensor power spectrum during inflation. Unlike standard mechanisms relying on classical dynamics or modified actions, this enhancement originates from the reduced density matrix of the observable sector after tracing over a hidden gravitational reservoir. This framework allows for a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio r &gt; 0.01 consistent with sub-Planckian inflaton excursions, providing a purely quantum mechanical evasion of the Lyth bound. The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive "quantum birthmark" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum. Furthermore, we forecast that this entanglement may manifest as a late-time stochastic noise enhancement in gravitational wave interferometers, offering a novel experimental window into the quantum nature of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter interacts through two long range forces: gravity and electromagnetism. While all matter contributes to the gravitational potential, electromagnetic effects were traditionally expected to cancel in large systems because positive and negative charges balance. Yet astrophysical objects clearly show long range electromagnetic behavior, so the cancellation cannot be perfect. This paper develops a model for stationary aggregation of matter into a star that consistently includes angular momentum and electromagnetic effects. We reformulate the standard polytropic stellar model as a variational problem and extend it to include the kinetic energy of rigid rotation and the electromagnetic interaction energy between oppositely charged baryonic matter. The electromagnetic contribution to the action is taken to be the minimal energy required to generate the stellar magnetic dipole moment. This energy has two parts: the pure electromagnetic contribution, expressible as a surface integral, and the free energy difference between magnetized and unmagnetized matter, obtained by analyzing a degenerate electron gas in a background of cold ions. Differential forms provide a convenient mathematical framework. The resulting model incorporates electromagnetic effects into stellar structure in a way consistent with linearized general relativity. Although the full system forms a complex open boundary problem, exact solutions exist under simplifying assumptions. The phase diagram predicted by the simplified model shows patterns that may motivate further study of the balance between matter, gravitation, and electromagnetism</description>

      <title>Spatial confinement-deconfinement transition in accelerated gluodynamics within lattice simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the influence of weak acceleration on the confinement-deconfinement phase transition in gluodynamics. Our study is carried out within lattice simulation in the comoving reference frame of accelerated observer which is parameterized by the Rindler coordinates. We find that finite temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition turns into spatial crossover in the Rindler spacetime. In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics. Our results imply that the spatial confinement-deconfinement transition might take place in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole horizon.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Maxwell extension of kinematical Lie algebras by promoting the contraction method underlying the Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond cube to a semigroup expansion framework. Within this approach, we show that both non- and ultra-relativistic Maxwell algebras admitting non-degenerate invariant bilinear forms can be systematically obtained from different parent algebras through a unified expansion scheme, leading to a Maxwellian kinematical cube. This construction is further generalized to an infinite hierarchy of kinematical algebras. The expansion method naturally provides the corresponding invariant tensors, allowing for the systematic construction of three-dimensional Chern-Simons gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the coprecession of both the accretion disk and the jet formed following the tidal disruption event associated with the optical transient AT2020afhd, driven by a supermassive black hole of almost ten million solar masses, were independently measured in both the X and radio bands, respectively, showing a periodicity of nearly 20 days over about 300 days. An analytical model of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring precession of the effective orbit of a fictitious test particle revolving about a spinning primary can explain the observed precessional features. It yields allowed regions in the system's parameter space which, as far as the hole's dimensionless spin parameter is concerned, are essentially in agreement with those obtained in the literature with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The present analytical approach can be extended to include the precession due to the hole's quadrupole mass moment as well. It breaks the degeneracy in the allowed regions occurring for negative and positive values of the spin parameter when only the Lense-Thirring effect is considered. The best estimate for the hole's mass yields the range $0.185-0.215$ for the dimensionless spin parameter. Using the same strategy with the gravitomagnetic frequency for an extended disk of finite size with a parameterized power-law mass density yields to distinct, generally non-overlapping allowed regions for each value of the power-law index adopted.</description>

      <title>Revisiting CPL with sign-switching density: to cross or not to cross the NECB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 BAO measurements, when combined with CMB and SNeIa data, exhibit a $3.2\sigma$-$3.4\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) described by the CPL-parametrized equation of state. A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $\rho_{\rm DE}+p_{\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\to-\Lambda$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.</description>

      <title>Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large-distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale-dependent coupling governed by an anomalous dimension $\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum-field-theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Gravity from equilibrium thermodynamics of stretched light cones</title>

Abstract: This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.</description>

      <title>Could an overlooked symmetry of the classical laws of gravity explain the cosmological puzzles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if the masses of timelike fields are point-dependent quantities transforming under conformal transformations as $m\rightarrow\Omega^{-1}m$, and the energy density of perfect fluids transforms as $\rho\rightarrow\Omega^{-4}\rho$, form-invariance under Weyl transformations is an actual symmetry of the gravitational interactions of matter. That is, under the mentioned circumstances, Weyl symmetry allows any matter field to be coupled to gravity. The phenomenological and physical consequences of the novel result, including the ``many worlds'' interpretation of gauge freedom, are drawn. We explore, in particular, a possible explanation of two major cosmological puzzles: dark matter and dark energy, as a consequence of Weyl symmetry. Quantum-mechanical removal of the spacetime singularities in this framework is briefly discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of scalar-tensor theories and scale-dependent gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>The Infrared Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08050v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscopic framework in which the cosmological exterior is treated as an open quantum subsystem coupled to horizon degrees of freedom. Although local conservation laws satisfy $\nabla_\mu\langle J^\mu\rangle=0$, transport of baryon number across horizons removes conserved charges from the observer--accessible sector, producing effective depletion in exterior densities. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the reduced exterior continuity equations. We show that relativistic causality forces this compensation to occur through long--wavelength geometric excitations: only infrared modes can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. An infrared return channel thus emerges as a generic feature of horizon--coupled semiclassical gravity.
  The second ingredient is a Carnot--Carath\'eodory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $\sigma$ governs both infrared mode excitation and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation. In this setting, photon trajectories follow recurrent horizontal geodesics, producing an effective cosmic cavity whose stationary state is a Planck spectrum characterized by $\sigma$. The same scale modifies large--radius circular motion in a manner consistent with flattened galactic rotation curves. Horizon thermodynamics and mesoscopic balance laws then link $\sigma$ to the cosmic expansion rate, yielding $H\sim\sigma$ and a unified infrared structure underlying photon equilibrium, baryon balance, and large--scale kinematics.</description>

      <title>GraviBERT: Transformer-based inference for gravitational-wave time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for gravitational wave inference, built on a multi-scale feature extractor with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. A key novelty of GraviBERT is its staged training: a BERT-style self-supervised pretraining phase to learn transferable representations, followed by supervised fine-tuning on labeled data. GraviBERT demonstrates consistent transfer learning across detector configurations and waveform models. On in-domain data, pretraining reduces the MAE by up to $31\%$ and accelerates convergence by $\sim 6.6 \times$, with mean relative precision for point estimates reaching the few-percent level and MAE in effective spin of $\sim 10^{-3}$ at SNR = 10. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model converges up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reduces estimation errors by up to $\sim 47\%$, demonstrating detector-agnostic learning. Cross-waveform approximant transfer achieves up to $44\%$ MAE reductions and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding $0.9$ for mass parameters at SNR = 10 compared to $0.74$ - $0.87$ when training from scratch. GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms, and in its current form quantifies predictive uncertainty through MC dropouts. After pretraining, the regression head could be adapted to multiple downstream inference tasks in gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>A universal lower bound on the photon sphere radius in higher-dimensional black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photon sphere, a hypersurface of circular null geodesics, plays a fundamental role in characterizing black hole spacetimes, influencing phenomena such as black hole shadows, gravitational lensing, and quasinormal modes. While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_\gamma$ satisfies $r_\gamma\ge (\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_\gamma\ge \frac{3}{2}r_H$. Our result generalizes Hod's four-dimensional theorem to higher dimensions, and provides a new geometric constraint on the structure of black holes in extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: universal $g/f$ Hawking-temperature scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics by introducing an invariant Planck energy scale $E_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ alongside the speed of light, while preserving the relativity principle. A key issue in curved spacetimes, particularly black-hole thermodynamics, is the operational meaning of the ``energy'' in modified dispersion relations (MDRs).
  We compare two common implementations in a controlled static black-hole spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on a fixed background geometry, and (ii) the rainbow-metric approach with an energy-dependent family of effective metrics. For static, spherically symmetric horizons and using a consistent finite operational energy scale $E_\star$ for emitted quanta, both yield the same near-horizon temperature rescaling \[ T(E_\star)=T_0\,\frac{g(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}{f(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}, \quad T_0=\kappa_0/(2\pi), \] where $f$ and $g$ are the standard rainbow/MDR functions. This establishes a universality of the tunneling/surface-gravity temperature, with deformation entering solely via the ratio $g/f$.
  We illustrate for Amelino-Camelia MDR and Magueijo-Smolin DSR (where $f=g$, implying $T(E_\star)=T_0$). Extending to a two-parameter generalized DSR (G-DSR) with leading parameters $(\alpha_2, \Delta\alpha)$, we obtain \[ T_{\mathrm{GDRS}}(E_\star) = T_0 \sqrt{\frac{1-2\Delta\alpha\,(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}{1-2\alpha_2\,(E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}})}} \simeq T_0 [1 - (\Delta\alpha - \alpha_2) E_\star/E_{\mathrm{Pl}}]. \]
  We discuss the role of $\Delta\alpha - \alpha_2$ (vanishing correction for the symmetric $\Delta\alpha=\alpha_2$ subfamily) and note that further model dependence arises from phase-space measures, greybody factors, and non-linear composition laws. Corrections are strongly suppressed for macroscopic black holes and become relevant only near the Planck regime.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistent Description of Compact Stars of Two Interacting Fluids: The Case of Neutron Stars with Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically consistent approach for the computation of the masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities of compact stars consisting of two interacting fluids with separately conserved quantum numbers. We apply this interacting fluid approach to the case of compact stars of neutron star matter with the Higgs portal fermionic dark matter model for the first time in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The patterns for the mass-radius curves and the tidal deformability depend on the dark matter particle mass and are different from former studies. Compared to ordinary neutron star properties, we obtain smaller masses and radii for dark matter particle masses similar to the nucleon mass and, hence, smaller tidal deformabilities as a result of the softening of the equation of state due to the presence of dark matter. For dark matter particle masses below the nucleon mass and sizable chemical potentials with respect to the dark matter particle mass, there will be a dark halo instead of dark core. Our investigation provides the basis for studying mergers of compact stars where the two fluids of neutron star matter and dark matter are coupled kinetically to each other and are described by one combined energy-momentum tensor of the two interacting fluids but are chemically different with two separately conserved number currents.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Redshifts from Multiband of GRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the gravity quantum theory, the quantization of spacetime may lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum and the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). High energy and long-distance gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observations in the universe provide a unique opportunity to test the possibility of LIV. In this work, we use 88 time delays from GRBs ($0.117 &lt; z &lt; 6.29$), and provide a cosmological model-independent approach based on the luminosity distance data from 174 GRBs to test LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-dependent velocity caused by the corrected dispersion relationship of photons. These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1} \ge 1.5\times 10^{15}$ GeV, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2} \ge 8.5\times 10^{9}$ GeV, respectively. It exhibits a significantly reduced value compared to the energy scale of Planck in both scenarios of linear and quadratic LIV.</description>

Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or "covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

Abstract: Recent work by Headrick, Sasieta and myself provides an extension of the HRT formula for asymptotically flat spacetimes. I use this formula to construct a holographic model of black hole evaporation in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes using Brill-Lindquist (BL) wormholes. The wormhole is interpreted via ER=EPR to represent the entanglement geometry between an evaporating black hole and baths into which the Hawking radiation is collected. Applying HRT, I compute the entanglement entropy by numerically computing the areas of the minimal surfaces, which is shown to obey the Page curve, consistent with information conservation. Numerical analysis is done for both three and four-boundary BL wormholes ($n=3,4$). Index-1 surfaces in the wormhole interior are interpreted as the candidate bulges involved in the python's lunch conjecture (PLC), and their areas are used to compute the restricted complexity $\mathcal{C}$ of decoding the Hawking radiation. The results are compared to the time-dependent predictions of the PLC.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Metric-Induced Principal Symbols in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometrical formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics by expressing its principal symbol as an optical metric-induced object. Under the assumption of no birefringence, we show that the evolution of linear perturbations can be recast as a covariant divergence on a curved, field-dependent background, enabling the application of quantum field theory techniques as in Maxwell's theory in curved backgrounds. This geometric reformulation opens a new route for analogue models potentially implementable in laboratory via tailored nonlinear metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Generalized Unitarity Method for Worldline Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized unitarity method for theories of point-particle worldlines coupled to gravity, analogous to that of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. This method allows the computation of perturbative observables from basic principles such as locality and unitarity, thus avoiding gauge redundancies and the use of Feynman diagrams. We illustrate the method with a variety of examples, including the gravitational waveform for the scattering of two point masses at next-to-leading order (or ${\cal O}(G^{5/2})$), reproducing known results. Our method further streamlines the calculation of the scattering dynamics of compact binary systems and opens the door to further applications and systematical exploration of structure in this class of observables.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry Breaking with Fields, Strings and Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this review tries to provide a self-contained view of supersymmetry breaking from the bottom-up perspective. We thus describe N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, the Standard Model and the MSSM, with emphasis on the ``soft terms'' that can link it to supergravity. The second part deals with the top-down perspective. It addresses, insofar as possible in a self-contained way, the basic setup provided by ten-dimensional strings and their links with supergravity, toroidal orbifolds, Scherk-Schwarz deformations and Calabi-Yau reductions, before focusing on a line of developments that is closely linked to our own research. Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional non-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly realized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional Minkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most symmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve internal intervals. We then turn to a discussion of fluxes in Calabi-Yau vacua and the KKLT setup, and conclude with some aspects of Cosmology, emphasizing some intriguing clues that the tadpole potentials can provide for the onset of inflation. The appendices collect some useful material on global and local N=1 supersymmetry, in components and in superspace, on string vacuum amplitudes, and on convenient tools used to examine the fluctuations of non-supersymmetric string vacua.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, One Point Functions and Black Hole Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses.</description>
