      <title>S-MolSearch: 3D Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Bioactive Molecule Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Screening is an essential technique in the early phases of drug discovery, aimed at identifying promising drug candidates from vast molecular libraries. Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for enrichment factors across 0.5%, 1% and 5%.</description>

      <title>De novo design of high-affinity protein binders with AlphaProteo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational design of protein-binding proteins is a fundamental capability with broad utility in biomedical research and biotechnology. Recent methods have made strides against some target proteins, but on-demand creation of high-affinity binders without multiple rounds of experimental testing remains an unsolved challenge. This technical report introduces AlphaProteo, a family of machine learning models for protein design, and details its performance on the de novo binder design problem. With AlphaProteo, we achieve 3- to 300-fold better binding affinities and higher experimental success rates than the best existing methods on seven target proteins. Our results suggest that AlphaProteo can generate binders "ready-to-use" for many research applications using only one round of medium-throughput screening and no further optimization.</description>

      <title>Multi-variable control to mitigate loads in CRISPRa networks: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of CRISPR-mediated gene activation (CRISPRa) has transformed the way in which we perform genetic screening, bioproduction and therapeutics through its ability to scale and multiplex. However, the emergence of loads on the key molecular resources constituting CRISPRa by the orthogonal short RNA that guide such resources to gene targets, couple theoretically independent CRISPRa modules. This coupling negates the ability of CRISPRa systems to concurrently regulate multiple genes independent of one another. In this paper, we propose to reduce this coupling by mitigating the loads on the molecular resources that constitute CRISPRa. In particular, we design a multi-variable controller that makes the concentration of these molecular resources robust to variations in the level of the short RNA loads. This work serves as a foundation to design and implement CRISPRa controllers for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum-machine-assisted Drug Discovery: Survey and Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery and development is a highly complex and costly endeavor, typically requiring over a decade and substantial financial investment to bring a new drug to market. Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</description>
