      <title>Equatorial African Lightning: Past. Present and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightning strikes are one of the leading causes of death among natural disasters in tropical regions. The Congo rainforests host the highest rates of lightning flashes in the world and the lightning properties in this region have a strong seasonality owing to the cross-equatorial movements of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) throughout the year. The Lightning Flash Rates (LFR) are found to peak during the Equinoctial months while lightning radiance assumes the strongest values during the Boreal Summer months. Across the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) duration, (1998-2015), annual LFR in the Congo rainforest increases steadily, however, the average and the peak lightning radiances decrease by ~1%/year and ~1.5%/year respectively which is counter-intuitive to the expected intensification in weather extremes in a warming climate. An in-depth analysis highlighted the influence of moisture convergence over the Congo Basin from the Atlantic as the primary contributor to lightning compared to the aerosol nucleation and thermodynamic instability effects during the boreal summers. Further, it has been proposed that in a gradually warming climate, the strength of the prevailing ITCZ over Sahel region has intensified thereby weakening the moisture ingress towards the Congo Basin, and this resulted in the observed reduction in lightning intensity in recent years. Consequently, the long-term projections of lightning properties from global model simulations revealed a prominent weakening in lightning (~50%) over the Congo Basin by the year 2100 assuming the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 emission scenarios. Key Words: Lightning, LIS, Congo Basin, Sahel, Moisture Flux, Future projections.</description>

      <title>Chinese Historical Documents Reveal Multi-Century Seasonal Shifts in Tropical Cyclone Landfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paleoclimate records provide a critical long-term perspective on natural climate variability, essential for understanding contemporary climate change. However, many existing paleoclimate proxies lack the temporal resolution to analyze seasonality shifts in high-impact extremes like tropical cyclones (TCs). This study compares records from Chinese historical documents with modern climate reanalyses and simulations to investigate multi-century shifts of TC landfalls in East Asia. Comparing pre-industrial (1776-1850) and contemporary (1946-2020) landfall timing suggests an earlier seasonal occurrence in the contemporary era. However, the magnitude of this shift is small relative to the pronounced multi-century variations evident in the historical records, complicating attribution solely to anthropogenic forcings. Furthermore, the recent shift is inconsistent with the relationship between the TC seasonality and the equatorial Pacific temperature revealed by pre-industrial and contemporary-era data. By revealing significant natural variability over centuries, this study provides crucial long-term context essential for interpreting contemporary and future TC trends.</description>
