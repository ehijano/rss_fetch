      <title>First Event-by-Event Identification of Cherenkov Radiation from Sub-MeV Particles in Liquid Argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter reports the event-by-event observation of Cherenkov light from sub-MeV electrons in a high scintillation light-yield liquid argon (LAr) detector by the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment. The CCM200 detector, located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, instruments 7 tons (fiducial volume) of LAr with 200 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 80% of which are coated in a wavelength shifting material and the remaining 20% are uncoated. In the prompt time region of an event, defined as $-6 \leq t \leq 0$ ns relative to the event start time $t=0$, the uncoated PMTs are primarily sensitive to visible Cherenkov photons. Using gamma-rays from a $^{22}$Na source for production of sub-MeV electrons, we isolated prompt Cherenkov light with $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence and developed a selection to obtain a low-background electromagnetic sample. This is the first event-by-event observation of Cherenkov photons from sub-MeV electrons in a high-yield scintillator detector, and represents a milestone in low-energy particle detector development.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Liquid Argon Scintillation Pulse Shape Using Differentiable Simulation in the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment is a liquid argon (LAr) light collection detector searching for MeV-scale neutrino and Beyond Standard Model physics signatures. Two hundred 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) instrument the 7 ton fiducial volume with 50% photocathode coverage to detect light produced by charged particles. CCM's light-based approach reduces requirements of LAr purity, compared to other detection technologies, such that sub-MeV particles can be reliably detected without additional LAr filtration and with O(1) parts-per-million of common contaminants. We present a measurement of LAr light production and propagation parameters, with uncertainties, obtained from a sample of MeV-scale electromagnetic events. The optimization of this high-dimensional parameter space was facilitated by a differentiable optical photon Monte-Carlo simulation, and detailed PMT response characterization. This result accurately predicts the timing and spatial distribution of light due to scintillation and Cherenkov emission in the detector. This is the first description of photon propagation in LAr to include several effects, including: anomalous dispersion of the index of refraction near the ultraviolet resonance, Mie scattering from impurities, and Cherenkov light production.</description>

      <title>Muon Signal Charge in the Underground Muon Detector of AugerPrime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory features a calorimetric detection mode that estimates the number of muons based on signal charge measurements. This contribution provides an overview of the calibration procedure, revisiting the previously published strategy and identifying a bias introduced by the triggers used to estimate the mean charge deposited by a vertical muon. We demonstrate that calibrating underground detectors requires careful consideration of the interactions of penetrating particles through matter. In devices based on plastic scintillators, energy deposition, and thus the recorded charge, is significantly affected by knock-on electron production in the surrounding ground as muons traverse the medium. To mitigate this effect, we propose a new calibration strategy that ensures an unbiased muon estimator. This approach is applied to data collected from 2019 to 2024.</description>

      <title>CycleGAN-Driven Transfer Learning for Electronics Response Emulation in High-Purity Germanium Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are a key technology for rare-event searches such as neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and dark matter experiments. Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction topology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse shape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that distinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable simulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of first-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics, requiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to accurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic Positional U-Net (CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so that they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this Response Emulation Network (REN) learns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high fidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact (ICPC) geometry to show that CPU-Net effectively captures and reproduces critical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without detector-specific tuning. CPU-Net achieves up to a factor-of-four improvement in distribution-level agreement for pulse shape parameter reconstruction, while preserving the topology-dependent information required for pulse-shape discrimination.</description>

      <title>The calibration house in JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an auxiliary system within the calibration system of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, a calibration house is designed to provide interfaces for connecting the central detector and accommodating various calibration sub-systems. Onsite installation has demonstrated that the calibration house interfaces are capable of effectively connecting to the central detector and supporting the installation of complex and sophisticated calibration sub-systems. Additionally, controlling the levels of radon and oxygen within the calibration house is critical. Radon can increase the experimental background, while oxygen can degrade the quality of the liquid scintillator. The oxygen concentration can be maintained at levels below 10 parts per million, and the radon concentration can be kept below 15 mBq/m$^{3}$. This paper will provide detailed information on the calibration house and its methods for radon and oxygen concentration control.</description>

      <title>CRYSP: a Total-Body PET based on cryogenic cesium iodide crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. In this context, pure cesium iodide (CsI) monolithic crystals, given their much lower cost compared with currently used rare-earth crystals, offer a promising solution to improve accessibility. When operated at cryogenic temperatures (approximately 100 K), CsI crystals exhibit one of the highest light outputs among inorganic crystals, around $10^5$ photons/MeV. This results in energy resolution below 7%, millimeter-scale spatial resolution (including accurate depth-of-interaction determination), and coincidence time resolution at the nanosecond level, despite their relatively slow scintillation decay time. This study demonstrates that a TBPET scanner based on cryogenic CsI monolithic crystals might have the potential to deliver high-performance imaging at a reduced cost compared with conventional systems, paving the way for broader deployment and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Optimization of a cosmic muon tomography scanner for cargo border control inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past several decades have seen significant advancement in applications using cosmic-ray muons for tomography scanning of unknown objects. One of the most promising developments is the application of this technique in border security for the inspection of cargo inside trucks and sea containers in order to search for hazardous and illicit hidden materials. This work focuses on the optimization studies for a muon tomography system similar to that being developed within the framework of the `SilentBorder' project funded by the EU Horizon 2020 scheme. Current studies are directed toward optimizing the detector module design, following two complementary approaches. The first leverages TomOpt, a Python-based end-to-end software that employs differentiable programming to optimize scattering tomography detector configurations. While TomOpt inherently supports gradient-based optimization, a Bayesian Optimization module is introduced to better handle scenarios with noisy objective functions, particularly in image reconstruction-driven optimization tasks. The second optimization strategy relies on detailed GEANT4-based simulations, which, while more computationally intensive, offer higher physical fidelity. These simulations are also employed to study the impact of incorporating secondary particle information alongside cosmic muons for improved material discrimination. This paper presents the current status and results obtained from these optimization studies.</description>

      <title>Performance of newly constructed plastic scintillator barrel in the WASA-FRS experiments and evaluation of radiation damage effects on multi-pixel photon counter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A barrel-shaped plastic scintillation counter with Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) readout has been developed and operated in the first WASA-FRS experimental campaign at GSI. The detector was used to measure charged particles emitted from reactions induced by a 2.5 GeV proton beam incident on a carbon target, providing particle identification in combination with momentum reconstruction in a 1 T magnetic field. The performance of this detector, particularly its response to energy deposition and time resolution, was systematically investigated as a function of count rate and total number of irradiating protons. A time resolution of 45-75 ps ($\sigma$), depending on the energy deposition, was achieved. Stable performance was maintained under high-rate conditions up to 1.35 MHz per single counter, with no significant degradation in either signal amplitude or timing response. Radiation-induced damage to the MPPCs was observed primarily as a reduction in signal amplitude, with approximately $35\%$ decrease at an estimated 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluence of $2.4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Long Term Study of Sedimentation and Biofouling at Cascadia Basin, the Site of the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09086v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of biofouling and sedimentation on pathfinder instrumentation for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment (P-ONE), which will be located in the Cascadia Basin region of the North Pacific Ocean. P-ONE will look for high-energy neutrinos by observing the light produced when these neutrinos interact in the water, detecting and digitizing single photon signals in the ultraviolet-visible range. We measure that biofouling and sedimentation caused a decrease in the transparency of upward-facing optical surfaces over 5 years of operations. A majority of downward-facing optical surfaces, which will dominate P-ONE's sensitivity to astrophysical sources, showed no visible biofouling. Extrapolations motivated by biological growth models estimated that these losses started around 2.5 years after deployment, and suggest a final equilibrium transparency ranging between 0$\%$ and 35$\%$ of the original for the upward-facing modules.</description>

      <title>Calibration and Performance of the Surface Scintillator Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has led to significant advances in our understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These new insights have driven a major upgrade of the Observatory, known as AugerPrime, through which the experiment has entered its Phase II, a new period of data collection. A key part of the upgrade is adding surface scintillator detectors (SSD) on top of the existing water-Cherenkov detectors (WCD). The main goal is to leverage their different responses to the electromagnetic and muonic shower components, enhancing the reconstruction of the primary cosmic-ray mass. In this contribution, we present the methods that involve analyzing peak and charge distributions of atmospheric muons for accurate calibration during extensive air-shower event reconstruction, along with the development of a rate-based algorithm for independent calibration. We also show the performance of the SSDs with Phase-II data, including PMT reliability and stability of key parameters, such as gain and signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Noise Filtering Algorithm Based on Graph Neural Network for STCF Drift Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The super $\tau$-charm facility (STCF) is a next-generation electron-positron collider with high luminosity proposed in China. The higher luminosity leads to increased background level, posing significant challenges for track reconstruction of charged particles. Particularly in the low transverse momentum region, the current track reconstruction algorithm is notably affected by background, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction efficiency and a high fake rate. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based noise filtering algorithm (GNF Algorithm) as a preprocessing step for the track reconstruction. The GNF Algorithm introduces a novel method to convert detector data into graphs and applies a tiered threshold strategy to map GNN-based edge classification results onto signal-noise separation. The study based on Monte Carlo (MC) data shows that with the implementation of the GNF Algorithm, the reconstruction efficiency with the standard background is comparable to the case without background, while the fake rate is significantly reduced. Thus, GNF Algorithm provides essential support for the STCF tracking software.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Modeling of the $^{163}$Ho Calorimetric Electron Capture Spectrum from the HOLMES Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09240v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the calorimetric electron capture (EC) decay spectrum of $^{163}$Ho as measured by the HOLMES experiment. Using high-statistics data, we unfold the instrumental energy resolution from the measured spectrum and model it as a sum of Breit-Wigner resonances and shake-off continua, providing a complete set of parameters for each component. Our approach enables the identification and tentative interpretation of all observed spectral features, including weak and overlapping structures, in terms of atomic de-excitation processes. We compare our phenomenological model with recent ab initio theoretical calculations, finding good agreement for both the main peaks and the spectral tails, despite the limitations of current theoretical and experimental precision. The model delivers an accurate description of the endpoint region, which is crucial for neutrino mass determination, and allows for a realistic treatment of backgrounds such as pile-up and tails of low-energy components. Furthermore, our decomposition facilitates the generation of Monte Carlo toy spectra for sensitivity studies and provides a framework for investigating systematic uncertainties related to solid-state and detector effects. This work establishes a robust foundation for future calorimetric neutrino mass experiments employing $^{163}$Ho, supporting both data analysis and experimental design.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of antennas to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to detect them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Three prototype GRAND radio arrays have been in operation since 2023: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the GRAND detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a first look at data collected by GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger, including the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by them.</description>

      <title>Surface scattering of atoms for high-sensitivity spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity laser spectroscopy is integral to applications like atomic clocks, quantum computers, and chemical sensing. Lowering atomic temperature decreases spectral Doppler broadening and increases transit time across the excitation laser. We find that a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated surface can cool iron atoms from ~1400 K to room temperature by surface scattering. It is also apparent that a single scattering event is enough for atoms to equilibrate with the PDMS surface temperature. Further, we show the very low adsorption of iron and ytterbium atoms on PDMS, an effect that persists to surface temperatures of 200 K. Through numerical simulation, we demonstrate the potential use of surface scattering in making a room temperature source of collimated atoms with enhanced flux and reduced velocity compared to that without surface scattering.</description>

      <title>Practical Crystallography with a Transmission Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) is a powerful technique providing for crystal structure solutions of sub-micron sized crystals too small for structure determination via X-ray techniques. The entry requirement, however, of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) adapted with bespoke software for coordinated sample stage rotation and continuous electron diffraction data acquisition has generally inhibited the wider uptake of 3DED. To address this limitation, we present novel software GiveMeED appropriate for controlled 3DED data acquisition. The collection of useable reflections beyond 0.8 {\AA} makes 3DED crystallographic processing effectively routine, using standard software and workflows derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) techniques. A full experimental workflow for 3DED on a conventional TEM is described in practical terms, in combination with direct imaging, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for the return of comprehensive correlative descriptions of crystal morphologies and sample compositions, with due regard for the quantification of electron flux at each stage of the characterisation process. The accuracy and effectiveness of GiveMeED is demonstrated through structure solutions for case study paracetamol, copper(II) phthalocyanine, and percholorocoronene samples, characterised in their near-native states under controlled low dose conditions at either room or cryogenic temperatures, with determined unit cell parameters and atomic connectivity matching accepted literature X-ray structures for these compounds. To promote the wider adoption of 3DED, we make GiveMeED freely available for use and modification, in support of greater uptake and utilisation of structure solution procedures via electron diffraction.</description>

      <title>A Cost Effective Optimization of the hybrid-DOM Design for TRIDENT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TRIDENT is a planned multi-cubic-kilometer deep-sea neutrino telescope to be built in the South China Sea, designed to rapidly discover high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources with sensitivity to all neutrino flavors. Achieving this at scale requires a detector design that balances performance with power, cost, and mechanical simplicity. This study presents a cost-effective optimization of TRIDENT's hybrid Digital Optical Module (hDOM) design, comparing configurations using high-quantum-efficiency (QE) 3-inch PMTs and larger 4-inch PMTs, the latter evaluated with both baseline and enhanced QE assumptions. Using full-chain detector simulations incorporating site-specific seawater optical properties and realistic backgrounds, we assess performance in all-flavor neutrino detection efficiency, directional reconstruction, and tau neutrino flavor identification from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. We find that if 4-inch PMTs can achieve QE comparable to 3-inch PMTs, their performance matches or improves upon that of the 3-inch design, while significantly reducing channel count, power consumption, and cost. These findings support the 4-inch PMT hDOM as a promising and scalable choice for TRIDENT's future instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Detector description conversion and visualization in Unity for high energy physics experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While visualization plays a crucial role in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments, the existing detector description formats including Geant4, ROOT, GDML, and DD4hep face compatibility limitations with modern visualization platforms. This paper presents a universal interface that automatically converts these four kinds of detector descriptions into FBX, an industry standard 3D model format which can be seamlessly integrated into advanced visualization platforms like Unity. This method bridges the gap between HEP instrumental display frameworks and industrial-grade visualization ecosystems, enabling HEP experiments to harness rapid technological advancements. Furthermore, it lays the groundwork for the future development of additional HEP visualization applications, such as event display, virtual reality, and augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Acoustic Signatures of Saturn's Upper Atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions for the acoustic attenuation coefficient and phase speed as functions of frequency and altitude in Saturn's atmosphere are presented and discussed. The pressure range considered in the study is 1 mbar to 1 bar, in windless and cloudless conditions. The atmospheric composition is represented by the major constituents, namely hydrogen (with its two spin isomers, ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$) and helium. The H$_2$ and He concentrations are assumed constant with respect to altitude; however, non-uniform ortho- and para-H$_2$ profiles are considered. The acoustic wavenumber is obtained by incorporating a viscous, thermal, and internal molecular relaxation effects in a linearized fluid dynamics model. The ambient inputs are vertical profiles of the specific heats, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity coefficients of the three-component (oH$_2$, pH$_2$, He) mixture, extracted at each pressure-temperature pair.

      <description>arXiv:2501.01143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119{\deg}, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Investigating irradiation effects and space charge sign inversion in n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Detectors built on n-type substrate (nLGADs) have been developed by IMB-CNM to enhance the detection of low-penetrating particles, with a wide range of applications from medicine, industry to synergies with developments for high-energy physics (HEP). In this work, irradiation effects on nLGADs were investigated through proton irradiation at the CERN PS-IRRAD facility up to proton fluences of $10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Electrical characterization before and after irradiation reveals space charge sign inversion of the n-type bulk, leading to significant modifications in the depletion behavior and electric field distribution. Utilizing UV TCT and TPA-TCT measurements, the impact of irradiation on the electric fields and the gain are studied in more detail, confirming a change of sensor depletion and a reduced electric field in the gain layer. The results suggest that donor removal in nLGADs is stronger pronounced already at lower fluences compared to acceptor removal in traditional p-type LGADs. These findings provide not only first insights into the effects of irradiation on nLGADs but also contribute to the development of methods to quantify the donor removal.</description>

      <title>A Downstream and vertexing algorithm for Long Lived Particles (LLP) selection at the first High-level trigger (HLT1) of LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new algorithm has been developed at LHCb which is able to reconstruct and select very displaced vertices in real-time at the first level of the trigger (HLT1). It makes use of the Upstream Tracker (UT) and the Scintillator Fiber detector (SciFi) of LHCb and it is executed on GPUs inside the Allen framework. In addition to an optimized strategy, it utilizes a Neural Network (NN) implementation to increase the track efficiency and reduce the ghost rates, with very high throughput and limited time budget. Besides serving to reconstruct $K_{s}^{0}$ and $\Lambda$ particles from the Standard Model, the Downstream algorithm and the associated two-track vertexing could largely increase the LHCb physics potential for detecting long-lived particles during the Run 3.</description>
