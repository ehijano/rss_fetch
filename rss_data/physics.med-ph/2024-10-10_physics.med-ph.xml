      <title>Pinv-Recon: Generalized MR Image Reconstruction via Pseudoinversion of the Encoding Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To present a novel generalized MR image reconstruction based on pseudoinversion of the encoding matrix (Pinv-Recon) as a simple yet powerful method, and demonstrate its computational feasibility for diverse MR imaging applications. Methods: MR image encoding constitutes a linear mapping of the unknown image to the measured k-space data mediated via an encoding matrix ($ data = Encode \times image$). Pinv-Recon addresses MR image reconstruction as a linear inverse problem ($image = Encode^{-1} \times data$), explicitly calculating the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the encoding matrix using truncated singular value decomposition (tSVD). Using a discretized, algebraic notation, we demonstrate constructing a generalized encoding matrix by stacking relevant encoding mechanisms (e.g., gradient encoding, coil sensitivity encoding, chemical shift inversion) and encoding distortions (e.g., off-center positioning, B$_0$ inhomogeneity, spatiotemporal gradient imperfections, transient relaxation effects). Iterative reconstructions using the explicit generalized encoding matrix, and the computation of the spatial-response-function (SRF) and noise amplification, were demonstrated. Results: We evaluated the computation times and memory requirements (time ~ (size of the encoding matrix)$^{1.4}$). Using the Shepp-Logan phantom, we demonstrated the versatility of the method for various intertwined MR image encoding and distortion mechanisms, achieving better MSE, PSNR and SSIM metrics than conventional methods. A diversity of datasets, including the ISMRM CG-SENSE challenge, were used to validate Pinv-Recon. Conclusion: Although pseudo-inversion of large encoding matrices was once deemed computationally intractable, recent advances make Pinv-Recon feasible. It has great promise for both research and clinical applications, and for educational use.</description>

      <title>Efficient proton arc optimization and delivery through energy layer pre-selection and post-filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton arc therapy (PAT) has emerged as a promising approach for improving dose distribution, but also enabling simpler and faster treatment delivery in comparison to conventional proton treatments. However, the delivery speed achievable in proton arc relies on dedicated algorithms, which currently do not generate plans with a clear speed-up and sometimes even result in increased delivery time. This study aims to address the challenge of minimizing delivery time through a hybrid method combining a fast geometry-based energy layer (EL) pre-selection with a dose-based EL filtering. Three methods of EL filtering were developed; The unrestricted method filters the lowest weighted EL while the SU gap filtering removes the EL around a new SU to minimize the gantry rotation braking. The SU filtering removes the lowest weighted group of EL that includes a SU. These filters were combined with the RayStation dynamic proton arc optimization framework (ELSA). Four bilateral oropharyngeal and four lung cancer patients' data were used for evaluation. Objective function values, target coverage robustness, organ-at-risk doses and NTCP evaluations, as well as comparisons to IMPT plans, were used to assess plan quality. The SU gap filtering algorithm performed best in five out of the eight cases, maintaining plan quality within tolerance while reducing beam delivery time, in particular for the oropharyngeal cohort. It achieved up to approximately 22% and 15% reduction in delivery time for oropharyngeal and lung treatment sites, respectively. The unrestricted filtering algorithm followed closely. In contrast, the SU filtering showed limited improvement, suppressing one or two SU without substantial delivery time shortening. Robust target coverage was kept within 1% of variation compared to the PAT baseline plan while organs-at-risk doses slightly decreased or kept about the same for all patients.</description>

      <title>Aligner-induced tooth movements in three dimensions using clinical data of two patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of a series of optically transparent aligners for orthodontic treatments depends on the anchoring of each tooth. In contrast with roots, the crowns' positions and orientations are measurable with intraoral scans, thus avoiding any X-ray dose. Exemplified by two patients, we demonstrate that three-dimensional crown movements could be determined with micrometer precision by registering weekly intraoral scans. The data show the movement and orientation changes of the individual crowns of the upper and lower jaws as the result of the forces generated by the series of aligners. During the first weeks, the canines and incisors were more affected than the premolars and molars. We detected an overall tooth movement of up to about 1 mm during a nine-week treatment. The data on these orthodontic treatments indicate the extent to which actual tooth movement lags behind the treatment plan as represented by the aligner shapes. The proposed procedure can not only be used to quantify the clinical outcome of the therapy, but also to improve future planning of orthodontic treatments for each specific patient. The study should be treated with caution because only two cases have been investigated and the approach should be applied to a reasonably large cohort to reach strong conclusions regarding efficiency and efficacy of the therapeutic approach.</description>

      <title>Direct3{\gamma}: A Pipeline for Direct Three-gamma PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel image reconstruction pipeline for three-gamma (3-{\gamma}) positron emission tomography (PET) aimed at improving spatial resolution and reducing noise in nuclear medicine. The proposed Direct3{\gamma} pipeline addresses the inherent challenges in 3-{\gamma} PET systems, such as detector imperfections and uncertainty in photon interaction points. A key feature of the pipeline is its ability to to determine the order of the detected photons to construct Compton cones, which intersect with the line of response (LOR) to provide an estimation of the emission point. The pipeline processes 3-{\gamma} PET raw data, reconstructs histo-images by propagating energy and spatial uncertainties along the LOR, and applies a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine these intermediate images into high-quality reconstructions. To further enhance image quality, the pipeline leverages both supervised learning and adversarial losses, with the latter preserving fine structural details. Experimental results demonstrate that Direct3{\gamma} consistently outperforms conventional 200-ps time-of-flight (TOF) PET in terms of SSIM and PSNR. This pipeline provides a robust framework for 3{\gamma}-PET imaging, enabling more accurate localization of emission points and setting the stage for improved diagnostic capabilities in clinical and research settings.</description>
