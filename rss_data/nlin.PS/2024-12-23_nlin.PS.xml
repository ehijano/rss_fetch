      <title>Coherent pulse interactions in mode-locked semiconductor lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of multipulse solutions in mode-locked lasers in presence of time-delayed feedback stemming, e.g., from reflections upon optical elements, and carrier dynamics. We demonstrate that the dynamics of such a high dimensional problem can be successfully described by some effective equations of motion for the pulses' phases and positions. Analyzing the reduced vector field permits disclosing a highly complex dynamics where coherent and incoherent interactions compete. The latter lead to regimes in which pulses can be equidistant or non-equidistant and also have different phase relations. Multi-stability between regimes is also observed as well as emerging limit cycles and global heteroclinic bifurcations in phase space.</description>

      <title>Spiral waves speed up cell cycle oscillations in the frog cytoplasm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16094v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral waves are a well-known phenomenon in excitable media, playing critical roles in biological systems such as cardiac tissues, where they are involved in arrhythmias, and in slime molds, where they guide collective cell migration. However, their presence in the cytoplasm of cells has not been reported to date. In this study, we present the observation of spiral waves in a Xenopus laevis frog egg extract reconstituting periodic cell cycle transitions. We find that the emergence of these spiral waves accelerates the cell division cycle nearly twofold. Using two distinct computational models, we demonstrate that this behavior arises from generic principles and is driven primarily by time-scale separation in the cell cycle oscillator. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between these spiral waves and the more commonly observed target pattern waves in the frog cytoplasm, providing new insights into their dynamic interactions.</description>
