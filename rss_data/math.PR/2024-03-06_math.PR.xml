      <title>Better-than-average uniform random variables and Eulerian numbers, or: How many candidates should a voter approve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $n$ independent random numbers with a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. The number of them that exceed their mean is shown to have an Eulerian distribution, i.e., it is described by the Eulerian numbers. This is related to, but distinct from, the well known fact that the integer part of the sum of independent random numbers uniform on $[0,1]$ has an Eulerian distribution. One motivation for this problem comes from voting theory.</description>

      <title>Community Detection on Block Models with Geometric Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the community recovery problem on a one-dimensional random geometric graph where every node has two independent labels: an observed location label and a hidden community label. A geometric kernel maps the locations of pairs of nodes to probabilities. Edges are drawn between pairs of nodes based on their communities and the value of the kernel corresponding to the respective node locations. Given the graph so generated along with the location labels, the latent communities of the nodes are to be inferred. In this work, we will look into the fundamental statistical limits for recovering the communities in such models. Additionally, we propose a linear-time algorithm (in the number of edges) and show that it recovers the communities of nodes exactly up to the information theoretic threshold.</description>

      <title>The elephant random walk in the triangular array setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gut and Stadm\"{u}ller (2021, 2022) initiated the study of the elephant random walk with limited memory. Aguech and El Machkouri (2024) published a paper in which they discuss an extension of results by Gut and Stadtm\"{u}ller (2022) for an "increasing memory" version of the elephant random walk without stops. Here we present a formal definition of the process which has been hinted at Eq. (2.2) in Gut and Stadtm\"{u}ller (2022). This definition is based on the triangular array setting. We give a positive answer to the open problem in Gut and Stadtm\"{u}ller (2022) for the elephant random walk, possibly with stops. We also obtain the CLT for the supercritical case of this model.</description>

      <title>Ruin Probability Approximation for Bidimensional Brownian Risk Model with Tax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{B}(t)=(B_1(t), B_2(t))$, $t\geq 0$ be a two-dimensional Brownian motion with independent components and define the $\mathbf{\gamma}$-reflected process $$\mathbf{X}(t)=(X_1(t),X_2(t))=\left(B_1(t)-c_1t-\gamma_1\inf_{s_1\in[0,t]}(B_1(s_1)-c_1s_1),B_2(t)-c_2t-\gamma_2\inf_{s_2\in[0,t]}(B_2(s_2)-c_2s_2)\right),$$ with given finite constants $c_1,c_2,\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_1,\gamma_2\in[0,1]$. The goal of this paper is to derive the asymptotics of ruin probability $$\mathbb{P}\{\exists_{t\in[0,T]}: X_1(t)&gt;u,X_2(t)&gt;au\}$$ as $u\to\infty$ taking $a\leq 1$ and $T&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Three central limit theorems for the unbounded excursion component of a Gaussian field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth, stationary Gaussian field $f$ on Euclidean space with fast correlation decay, there is a critical level $\ell_c$ such that the excursion set $\{f\geq\ell\}$ contains a (unique) unbounded component if and only if $\ell&lt;\ell_c$. We prove central limit theorems for the volume, surface area and Euler characteristic of this unbounded component restricted to a growing box. For planar fields, the results hold at all supercritical levels (i.e. all $\ell&lt;\ell_c$). In higher dimensions the results hold at all sufficiently low levels (all $\ell&lt;-\ell_c&lt;\ell_c$) but could be extended to all supercritical levels by proving the decay of truncated connection probabilities. Our proof is based on the martingale central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>The height gap of planar Brownian motion is $\frac{5}{\pi}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the occupation measure of planar Brownian motion exhibits a constant height gap of $5/\pi$ across its outer boundary. This property bears similarities with the celebrated results of Schramm--Sheffield [18] and Miller--Sheffield [12] concerning the height gap of the Gaussian free field across SLE$_4$/CLE$_4$ curves. Heuristically, our result can also be thought of as the $\theta \to 0^+$ limit of the height gap property of a field built out of a Brownian loop soup with subcritical intensity $\theta&gt;0$, proved in our recent paper [3]. To obtain the explicit value of the height gap, we rely on the computation by Garban and Trujillo Ferreras [1] of the expected area of the domain delimited by the outer boundary of a Brownian bridge.</description>

      <title>Binary search trees of permuton samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BST) are a popular type of data structure when dealing with ordered data. Indeed, they enable one to access and modify data efficiently, with their height corresponding to the worst retrieval time. From a probabilistic point of view, binary search trees associated with data arriving in a uniform random order are well understood, but less is known when the input is a non-uniform random permutation. We consider here the case where the input comes from i.i.d. random points in the plane with law $\mu$, a model which we refer to as a permuton sample. Our results show that the asymptotic proportion of nodes in each subtree depends on the behavior of the measure $\mu$ at its left boundary, while the height of the BST has a universal asymptotic behavior for a large family of measures $\mu$. Our approach involves a mix of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, namely combinatorial properties of binary search trees, coupling arguments, and deviation estimates.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spread model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. To study the spread of content, we define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion will die off or propagate widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination using a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have large expected mean degree or large receptiveness to content. When the amount of content spread only slightly exceeds the critical opinion reproduction number (i.e., the infodemic threshold), there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness is larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

      <title>Balls in groups: volume, structure and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give sharp bounds in Breuillard, Green and Tao's finitary version of Gromov's theorem on groups with polynomial growth. Precisely, we show that for every non-negative integer d there exists $c=c(d)&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is a group with finite symmetric generating set $S$ containing the identity and $|S^n|\le cn^{d+1}|S|$ for some positive integer $n$ then there exist normal subgroups $H\le\Gamma\le G$ such that $H\subseteq S^n$, such that $\Gamma/H$ is $d$-nilpotent (i.e. has a central series of length $d$ with cyclic factors), and such that $[G:\Gamma]\le g(d)$, where $g(d)$ denotes the maximum order of a finite subgroup of $GL_d(\mathbb{Z})$. The bounds on both the nilpotence and index are sharp; the previous best bounds were $O(d)$ on the nilpotence, and an ineffective function of $d$ on the index. In fact, we obtain this as a small part of a much more detailed fine-scale description of the structure of $G$. These results have a wide range of applications in various aspects of the theory of vertex-transitive graphs: percolation theory, random walks, structure of finite groups, scaling limits of finite vertex-transitive graphs.... We obtain some of these applications in the present paper, and treat others in companion papers. Some are due to or joint with other authors.</description>

      <title>Fill Probabilities in a Limit Order Book with State-Dependent Stochastic Order Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on computing the fill probabilities for limit orders positioned at various price levels within the limit order book, which play a crucial role in optimizing executions. We adopt a generic stochastic model to capture the dynamics of the order book as a series of queueing systems. This generic model is state-dependent and also incorporates stylized factors. We subsequently derive semi-analytical expressions to compute the relevant probabilities within the context of state-dependent stochastic order flows. These probabilities cover various scenarios, including the probability of a change in the mid-price, the fill probabilities of orders posted at the best quotes, and those posted at a price level deeper than the best quotes in the book, before the opposite best quote moves. These expressions can be further generalized to accommodate orders posted even deeper in the order book, although the associated probabilities are typically very small in such cases. Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical experiments using real order book data from the foreign exchange spot market. Our findings suggest that the model is tractable and possesses the capability to effectively capture the dynamics of the limit order book. Moreover, the derived formulas and numerical methods demonstrate reasonably good accuracy in estimating the fill probabilities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish large deviation estimates related to the Darling--Kac theorem and generalized arcsine laws for occupation and waiting times of ergodic transformations preserving an infinite measure, such as interval maps with indifferent fixed points. For the proof we imitate the study of generalized arcsine laws for occupation times of one-dimensional diffusion processes and adopt a method of double Laplace transform.</description>

      <title>A Note on High-Probability Analysis of Algorithms with Exponential, Sub-Gaussian, and General Light Tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note describes a simple technique for analyzing probabilistic algorithms that rely on a light-tailed (but not necessarily bounded) source of randomization. We show that the analysis of such an algorithm can be reduced, in a black-box manner and with only a small loss in logarithmic factors, to an analysis of a simpler variant of the same algorithm that uses bounded random variables and often easier to analyze. This approach simultaneously applies to any light-tailed randomization, including exponential, sub-Gaussian, and more general fast-decaying distributions, without needing to appeal to specialized concentration inequalities. Analyses of a generalized Azuma inequality and stochastic optimization with general light-tailed noise are provided to illustrate the technique.</description>

      <title>The clique chromatic number of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>Finding Super-spreaders in Network Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that a cascade (e.g., an epidemic) spreads on an unknown graph, and only the infection times of vertices are observed. What can be learned about the graph from the infection times caused by multiple distinct cascades? Most of the literature on this topic focuses on the task of recovering the entire graph, which requires $\Omega ( \log n)$ cascades for an $n$-vertex bounded degree graph. Here we ask a different question: can the important parts of the graph be estimated from just a few (i.e., constant number) of cascades, even as $n$ grows large?
  In this work, we focus on identifying super-spreaders (i.e., high-degree vertices) from infection times caused by a Susceptible-Infected process on a graph. Our first main result shows that vertices of degree greater than $n^{3/4}$ can indeed be estimated from a constant number of cascades. Our algorithm for doing so leverages a novel connection between vertex degrees and the second derivative of the cumulative infection curve. Conversely, we show that estimating vertices of degree smaller than $n^{1/2}$ requires at least $\log(n) / \log \log (n)$ cascades. Surprisingly, this matches (up to $\log \log n$ factors) the number of cascades needed to learn the \emph{entire} graph if it is a tree.</description>

      <title>A Unified Stochastic SIR Model Driven By L\'{e}vy Noise With Time-Dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified stochastic SIR model driven by L\'{e}vy noise. The model is structural enough to allow for time-dependency, nonlinearity, discontinuity, demography and environmental disturbances. We present concise results on the existence and uniqueness of positive global solutions and investigate the extinction and persistence of the novel model. Examples and simulations are provided to illustrate the main results.</description>

      <title>The Multivariate Rate of Convergence for Selberg's Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we quantify the rate of convergence in Selberg's central limit theorem for $\log|\zeta(1/2+it)|$ based on the method of proof given by Radziwill and Soundararajan. We achieve the same rate of convergence of $(\log\log\log T)^2/\sqrt{\log\log T}$ as Selberg in the Kolmogorov distance by using the Dudley distance instead. We also prove the theorem for the multivariate case given by Bourgade with the same rate of convergence as in the single variable case.</description>

      <title>Optimal Wasserstein-$1$ distance between SDEs driven by Brownian motion and stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the following two $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stochastic differential equations (SDEs):
  \begin{gather*}
  d X_t=b(X_t)\,d t + \sigma\,d L_t, \quad X_0=x,
  %\label{BM-SDE}
  d Y_t=b(Y_t)\,d t + \sigma\,d B_t, \quad Y_0=y,
  \end{gather*}
  where $\sigma$ is an invertible $d\times d$ matrix, $L_t$ is a rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process, and $B_t$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Brownian motion (note that $B_t$ is a rotationally symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process with $\alpha=2$). We show that for any $\alpha_0 \in (1,2)$ the Wasserstein-$1$ distance $W_1$ satisfies for $\alpha \in [\alpha_0,2)$
  \begin{gather*}
  W_{1}\left(X_{t}^x, Y_{t}^y\right)
  \leq C_1 e^{-C_2t}|x-y|
  +\frac{C}{\alpha_0-1}(2-\alpha)d\log(1+d),
  \end{gather*}
  which implies, in particular,
  \begin{equation} \label{e:W1Rate}
  W_1(\mu_\alpha, \mu_2)
  \leq \frac{C}{\alpha_0-1}(2-\alpha)d\log(1+d),
  \end{equation}
  where $\mu_\alpha$ and $\mu_2$ are the ergodic measures of $X_t$ and $Y_t$ respectively.
  For the special case of a $d$-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck system, we show that $W_1(\mu_\alpha, \mu_2) \geq C_{d} (2-\alpha)$ for all $\alpha\in(1,2)$; this indicates that the convergence rate with respect to $\alpha$ in the second bound is optimal. The term $d\log(1+d)$ appearing in this bound seems to be optimal for the dimension $d$ as well.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Analysis Approach to Tensor Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two different arguments using stochastic analysis to construct super-renormalizable tensor field theories, namely the $\mathrm{T}^4_3$ and $\mathrm{T}^4_4$ models. The first approach is the construction of a Langevin dynamic combined with a PDE energy estimate while the second is an application of the variational approach of Barashkov and Gubinelli. By leveraging the melonic structure of divergences, regularising properties of non-local products, and controlling certain random operators, we demonstrate that for tensor field theories these arguments can be significantly simplified in comparison to what is required for $\Phi^4_d$ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness results for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) and reflected BSDEs with an optional obstacle process in the case of appropriately weighted $\mathbb{L}^2$-data when the generator is integrated with respect to a possibly purely discontinuous process. This leads to a unified treatment of discrete-time and continuous-time (reflected) BSDEs. We compare our well-posedness results with the current literature and highlight that our results are sharp and cannot be improved within the framework presented here. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for a comparison principle.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture about Parrondo's paradox for two-armed slot machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1936 Mills Futurity slot machine had the feature that, if a player loses 10 times in a row, the 10 lost coins are returned. Ethier and Lee (2010) studied a generalized version of this machine, with 10 replaced by J. They established the Parrondo effect for a hypothetical two-armed machine with the Futurity award. Specifically, arm A and arm B, played individually, are asymptotically fair, but when alternated ran-domly (the so-called random mixture strategy), the casino makes money in the long run. They also considered the nonrandom periodic pattern strategy for patterns with r As and s Bs (e.g., ABABB if r = 2 and s = 3). They established the Parrondo effect if r + s divides J, and conjectured it in four other situations, including the case J = 2 with r &gt;= 1 and s &gt;= 1. We prove the conjecture in the latter case.</description>

Abstract: A celebrated result in probability theory is that a simple symmetric random walk on the $d$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is recurrent for $d=1,2$ and transient for $d\geq 3$. In this note, we derive a closed-form expression, in terms of the Lauricella function $F_C$, for the return probability for all $d\geq3$. Previously, a closed-form formula had only been available for $d=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an open interacting particle system on a finite lattice. The particles perform asymmetric simple exclusion and are randomly created or destroyed at all sites, with rates that grow rapidly near the boundaries. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density at the hyperbolic space-time scale and obtain the entropy solution to a boundary-driven quasilinear conservation law with a relaxation term. Different from the usual boundary conditions introduced in [Bardos, Roux, and Nedelec, (1979), Comm. Part. Diff. Equ], discontinuity (boundary layer) does not formulate at the boundaries due to the strong relaxation scheme.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and optimal transport of point processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine optimal matchings or transport between two stationary point processes and in particular, from a point process to the (integer) lattice or the Lebesgue measure respectively. The main focus of the article is the implication of hyperuniformity (reduced variance fluctuations in point processes) to optimal transport: in dimension $2$, we show that the typical matching cost has finite second moment under a mild logarithmic integrability condition on the reduced pair correlation measure, showing that most planar hyperuniform point processes are $ L^2$-perturbed lattices. Our method does not formally require assumptions on the correlation measure or the variance behaviour and it retrieves known sharp bounds for neutral integrable systems such as Poisson processes, and also applies to hyperfluctuating systems. The proof relies on the estimation of the optimal transport cost between point processes restricted to large windows for a well-chosen cost through their Fourier-Stieljes transforms, related to their structure factor. The existence of an infinite matching is obtained through a compactness argument on the space of random measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a disordered pinning model induced by a random walk whose increments have a finite fourth moment and vanishing first and third moments. It is known that this model is marginally relevant, and moreover, it undergoes a phase transition in an intermediate disorder regime. We show that, in the critical window, the point-to-point partition functions converge to a unique limiting random measure, which we call the critical disordered pinning measure. We also obtain an analogous result for a continuous counterpart to the pinning model, which is closely related to two other models: one is a critical stochastic Volterra equation that gives rise to a rough volatility model, and the other is a critical stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise that is white in time and delta in space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate extreme values of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions arising from counting inversions and descents of random elements of finite Coxeter groups. To this end, we construct a triangular array of either distribution from a sequence of Coxeter groups with increasing ranks. To avoid degeneracy of extreme values, the number of i.i.d. samples $k_n$ in each row must be asymptotically bounded. We employ large deviations theory to prove the Gumbel attraction of Mahonian and Eulerian distributions. It is shown that for the two classes, different bounds on $k_n$ ensure this.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider random iterations of polynomial maps $z^2 +c_n$ where $c_n$ are complex-valued independent random variables following the uniform distribution on the closed disk with center $c$ and radius $r$. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we study the (dis)connectedness of random Julia sets. Here, we reveal the relationships between the bifurcation radius and connectedness of random Julia sets. Second, we investigate the bifurcation of our random iterations and give quantitative estimates of bifurcation parameters. In particular, we prove that for the central parameter $c = -1$, almost every random Julia set is totally disconnected with much smaller radial parameters $r$ than expected. We also introduce several open questions worth discussing.</description>

Abstract: We derive the variational formula of the Loewner driving function of a simple chord under infinitesimal quasiconformal deformations with Beltrami coefficients supported away from the chord. As an application, we obtain the first variation of the Loewner energy of a Jordan curve, defined as the Dirichlet energy of the driving function of the curve. This result gives another explanation of the identity between the Loewner energy and the universal Liouville action introduced by Takhtajan and Teo, which has the same variational formula. We also deduce the variation of the total mass of SLE$_{8/3}$ loops touching the Jordan curve under quasiconformal deformations.</description>

      <title>Online Local False Discovery Rate Control: A Resource Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online local false discovery rate (FDR) control where multiple tests are conducted sequentially, with the goal of maximizing the total expected number of discoveries. We formulate the problem as an online resource allocation problem with accept/reject decisions, which from a high level can be viewed as an online knapsack problem, with the additional uncertainty of exogenous random budget replenishment. We start with general arrival distributions and propose a simple policy that achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such regret rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget buffers. We show that small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings. Our formulation may have wider applications beyond the problem considered in this paper, and our results emphasize how effective policies should be designed to reach a balance between circumventing wrong accept and reducing wrong reject in online resource allocation problems with exogenous budget replenishment.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and prove an equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$. In both settings using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik plays an important role.</description>
