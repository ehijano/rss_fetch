      <title>Optimal parameterizations for observational constraints on thawing dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying dark energy is often modeled in observational analyses through generic parameterizations of its equation of state $w(z)$, which typically use two free parameters $\{w_0, w_a\}$ to span a broad range of behaviors as a function of redshift. However, this broad range of behaviors can only approximately capture the dynamics of any given microphysical theory of dark energy. A complementary approach is to use targeted parameterizations designed to model specific classes of dynamical dark energy with greater precision. Focusing on the class of thawing dark energy, we quantify and compare the precision with which nineteen generic and targeted parameterizations can capture the dynamics of physically motivated thawing quintessence theories. We find that a targeted parameterization derived from a Pad\'e expansion of $w$ is the most reliable of these, producing accurate reconstructions of $w(z)$, the expansion history $H(z)$, and cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ for a broad range of microphysical theories.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Standard Siren Method: Improved Constraints on Modified Gravitational Wave Propagation with Future Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers have emerged as one of the most promising probes of cosmology and General Relativity (GR). However, a major challenge in fully exploiting GWs as standard sirens with current and future GW observatories is developing efficient and robust codes capable of analyzing the increasing data volumes that are, and will be, acquired. We present here \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, an advanced computational framework for hierarchical Bayesian inference of cosmological, modified gravity, and population hyperparameters using standard sirens and galaxy catalogs. This upgrade introduces novel GPU-accelerated algorithms to estimate the hierarchical likelihood, enabling the analysis of thousands of events - crucial for next-generation experiments - and includes the two-parameter ($\Xi_0-n$) modified GW propagation model. Using \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, we forecast cosmological and modified GW propagation constraints for the future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 run. We analyze three binary black hole populations of 300 events at SNR&gt;20, each with a different value of $\Xi_0$: 0.6, 1 (corresponding to GR), and 1.8. Multiple analyses were performed each catalog, comprising a population of approximately 5000 events, thanks to \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, which is 10-1000 times faster depending on the settings and catalog size. We jointly infer cosmological, modified GW propagation, and population hyperparameters. With spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, the fiducial $\Xi_0$ is recovered with a precision of 22%, 7.5%, and 10% for $\Xi_0$ = 0.6, 1, and 1.8, respectively; while the precision on $H_0$ is 2-7 times worse than when $\Xi_0$ is not inferred. Finally,in the case of photometric redshifts the constraints degrade on average by 3.5 times in all cases, underscoring the importance of future spectroscopic surveys in maximizing the constraining power of standard sirens.</description>

      <title>Are quasars reliable standard candles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the question whether the non-linear relation between the X-ray and UV emission of quasars can be used to derive their distances. In previous works of our group, we demonstrated that such a relation does not show any redshift evolution in its slope. The derived distances are in agreement with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model up to $z$$\sim$1.5, but they show significant deviations at higher redshifts. Yet, several authors suggested that this discrepancy is due to inconsistencies between the low- and high-redshift sources within the parent sample, or to a redshift evolution of the relation. Here, we discuss these issues through a quantitative comparison with supernova-derived distances in the common redshift range, complemented by simulations showing that all the claimed inconsistencies would naturally arise from any limitation of the cosmological model adopted for the data analysis, that is, from our ignorance of the true cosmology. We argue that the reliability of the method can only be based on a cosmology-independent evaluation of the hypothesis of non-evolution of the X-ray to UV relation at $z$&gt;1.5, subsequent to a careful check of the sample selection and of the flux measurements for possible redshift-dependent systematic effects. Since we do not conceive any physical reason for a sudden change of the normalization of the relation at $z$&gt;1.5, and we can exclude any severe systematic effect in the data selection and flux measurements, we conclude that the application of the X-ray to UV relation to cosmology is well motivated. To further strengthen this point, we need to achieve a better understanding of the physical process behind the observed relation and/or an independent observational proof possibly confirming the discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM found with quasars, such as future supernova measurements at $z$$\sim$2 or higher.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing tunnel voids in simulated light-cones: a new pipeline to investigate modified gravity and massive neutrinos signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids offer a unique opportunity to explore modified gravity (MG) models. Their low-density nature and vast extent make them especially sensitive to cosmological scenarios of the class $f(R)$, which incorporate screening mechanisms in dense, compact regions. Weak lensing (WL) by voids, in particular, provides a direct probe for testing MG scenarios. While traditional voids are identified from 3D galaxy positions, 2D voids detected in WL maps trace underdense regions along the line of sight and are sensitive to unbiased matter distribution. To investigate this, we developed an efficient pipeline for identifying and analyzing tunnel voids, i.e., underdensities detected in WL maps, specifically in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the convergence. In this work, we used this pipeline to generate realistic SNR maps from cosmological simulations featuring different $f(R)$ scenarios and massive neutrinos, comparing their effects against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Using the convergence maps and the 2D void catalogs, we analyzed various statistics, including the probability density function, angular power spectrum, and void size function. We then focused on the tangential shear profile around 2D voids, demonstrating how the proposed void-finding algorithm maximizes the signal. We showed that MG leads to deeper void shear profiles due to the enhanced evolution of cosmic structures, while massive neutrinos have the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that parametric functions typically applied to 3D void density profiles are not suitable for deriving the shear profiles of tunnel voids. We, therefore, proposed a new parametric formula that provides an excellent fit to the void shear profiles across different void sizes and cosmological models. Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the free parameters of this new formula to the cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Near-Peak Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Collapsing Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological domain walls appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If produced, they quickly enter into a self-similar scaling regime, where they are capable of efficiently sourcing a stochastic background of gravitational waves. In order to avoid a cosmological catastrophe, they must also decay before their enormous energy densities can have adverse effects on background dynamics. Here, we provide a suite of lattice simulations to comprehensively study the gravitational wave signatures of the domain wall network during this decay phase. The domain walls are initially formed through spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and subsequently decay through the action of a small bias term which causes regions of false vacuum to collapse. We find that gravitational waves are produced in abundance throughout this collapsing phase, leading to a shift in the peak frequency and increase in the overall amplitude of the spectrum by an $\mathcal{O}(100)$ factor when compared against simple analytic arguments. Importantly, we also find that the characteristic frequency of emitted gravitational waves increases as the network decays, which leads to a softening of the high frequency spectral index. This high frequency spectrum therefore carries key information related to the dynamics of the collapsing phase, and can be used to discriminate between different domain wall scenarios using upcoming data.</description>

      <title>Diversifying halo structures in two-component self-interacting dark matter models via mass segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), through gravothermal evolution driven by elastic self-scatterings, offers a compelling explanation for the observed diversity of inner halo densities. In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics in a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated by an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from relic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly enhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like halos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a new mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from gravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for reconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in central densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo structures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a diagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into the particle nature of SIDM.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave with Domain Wall Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Detection of cosmological dipoles aligned with transverse peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first observations of a novel dipole signature imprinted on the CMB by transverse velocities. Cosmological peculiar velocities point towards gravitational wells and away from potential hills, reflecting a large-scale dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over hundreds of Mpc. We predict large-scale dipoles in all fields correlated with the potential, observable via effects of gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW). The ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect, which has a dipole of the opposite sign. We provide a unified framework for analysing these dipoles, and make the first detections in galaxy density, CMB lensing convergence and the ISW effect. We show that the observed signals are consistent with LCDM predictions, and set limits on modified gravity. The CMB dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and orthogonal to the monopole correlation function, so this new observable provides additional cosmological information (abridged).</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of radio-luminous merger shocks from a large sample of galaxy cluster simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of merger shocks is a natural outcome of the hierarchical process of structure formation. As time elapses cosmic structures grow in mass and size via mergers and through the continuous accretion of material onto the potential wells of dark matter haloes. In particular, some dynamically-perturbed galaxy clusters exhibit spectacular non-thermal radio features known as radio relics that are believed to trace cluster merger shocks at different stages of evolution. These radio shocks are thought to be illuminated by the acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in the presence of intracluster magnetic fields. In this contribution, we analyse a large sample of hydrodynamical, cosmological re-simulations of merging galaxy clusters belonging to The Three Hundred Project to study the median evolution of radio relics as a function of cluster mass and redshift. This synthetic cluster merger sample enables us to compute in detail the luminosity output of radio shocks from their onset at core passage to demise.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical code that solves the Misner-Sharp system for a spherically symmetric cosmological model containing both a scalar field and a perfect fluid. While the code is capable of exploring general scenarios involving an minimally coupled scalar field and perfect fluid, we focus on the regime where the scalar field dominates the dynamics, particularly in the post-inflationary scalar field-dominated scenario, where the universe is governed by a rapidly oscillating scalar field for a period lasting a few $e$-folds. We analyse the threshold for PBH formation under quadratic and quartic potentials, evolving configurations from superhorizon scales. Our results confirm that a quartic potential behavior is similar to the radiation-dominated universe, resulting in a PBH formation threshold close to the well-established value in radiation backgrounds. Conversely, in the quadratic case, we observe a significant deviation from the expected dust-like behaviour, due to wave-like effects opposing the gravitational collapse. While numerical limitations prevent us from evolving a wide range of initial conditions to determine a precise threshold for PBH formation, our findings suggest that PBH formation may be suppressed with respect to the pure dust scenario, allowing the formation of stable solitonic structures instead. This study highlights the importance of properly accounting for wave dynamics in oscillating scalar fields when characterising PBH formation.</description>

      <title>One-loop correction to primordial tensor modes during radiation era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the conservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during inflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure from this property would require reinterpreting the data. This is why it is important to understand how superhorizon perturbations interact with the thermal plasma driving the radiation dominated Universe. We model the plasma by free photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations. This correction grows in time and is not suppressed by any small parameter. While one-loop result is not reliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially interesting effects that should be investigated further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. We analyze the impact of the transition rate on the scalar potential. We find that the finite transition duration suppresses the oscillation amplitude of the scalar potential, consequently suppressing the amplitude of the GW energy spectrum. By numerically solving the background and perturbation equations, we demonstrate that the physically motivated models, such as the evaporation of primordial black holes and the decay of Q-balls, cannot produce an observable GW signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive overview of Myrzakulov gravity, highlighting key developments and significant results shaping the theory. It examines the foundational principles, field equations, and the role of non-metricity and torsion in gravitational interactions. The theory's implications extend to cosmology, astrophysics, and strong gravitational fields, offering alternatives to dark matter and dark energy. A focus is placed on the modified Einstein-Hilbert action, its impact on cosmic expansion, and astrophysical applications such as black holes and gravitational waves. Observational constraints from cosmology and gravitational wave tests are discussed to refine the model. By situating Myrzakulov gravity within the broader context of modified gravity, this review explores its potential to reshape fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: We present a new framework of grand unification that is equipped with an axion solution to the strong CP problem without a domain wall problem when the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken after inflation. Our grand unified theory (GUT) is based on a symmetry breaking pattern, $SU(10) \times SU(5)_1 \rightarrow SU(5)_V \supset SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, where $SU(5)_1$ and a special embedding of $SU(5)_2\subset SU(10)$ are broken to a diagonal subgroup $SU(5)_V$. The model contains a vector-like pair of PQ-charged fermions that transform as (anti-)fundamental representations under $SU(10)$, so that the domain wall number is one. However, after the GUT symmetry breaking, the number of vector-like pairs of PQ-charged colored fermions is larger than one, which seems to encounter the domain wall problem. This apparent inconsistency is resolved by small instanton effects on the axion potential which operate as a PQ-violating bias term and allow the decay of domain walls. We propose a domain-wall-free UV completion for an IR model where the domain wall number appears larger than one. The model gives a prediction for a dark matter axion window, which is different from that of the ordinary post-inflationary QCD axion with domain wall number one.</description>

      <title>F-Term Hybrid Inflation and SUSY Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider F-term hybrid inflation and supersymmetry breaking in the context of a model which largely respects a global U(1) R symmetry. The Kaehler potential parameterizes the Kaehler manifold with an enhanced U(1)_Rx(SU(1,1)/U(1)) symmetry, where the scalar curvature of the second factor is determined by the achievement of a supersymmetry-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. The magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term for the inflaton can be adjusted in the range (1.2-460) TeV -- increasing with the dimensionality of the representation of the waterfall fields -- so that the inflationary observables are in agreement with the observational requirements. The mass scale of the supersymmetric partners turns out to lie in the region (0.09-253) PeV which is compatible with high-scale supersymmetry and the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass. The mu parameter can be generated by conveniently applying the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and assures the out-of-equilibrium decay of the R saxion at a low reheat temperature Trh&lt;163 GeV.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Winds Drive Large-Scale Cold Gas Outflows in Quasars during the Reionization Epoch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. Using stacked [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars -- tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds -- with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.</description>

      <title>Robust direction-dependent gain-calibration of beam-modelling errors far from the target field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many astronomical questions require deep, wide-field observations at low radio frequencies. Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this, but have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and direction-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of observations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range. Many tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to infer gains. However, these calibration tools struggle with precision calibration for relatively bright (e.g. A-team) sources far from the beam centre. Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially obscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a smooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and how this affects gain-calibration results. Subsequently, we introduce an improvement for smooth spectral gain constraints for direction-dependent gain-calibration algorithms, in which the level of regularisation is weighted by the expected station response to the sky model. We test this method using direction-dependent calibration method DDECal and physically-motivated beam modelling errors for LOFAR-HBA stations. The new method outperforms the standard method for various calibration settings near nulls in the beam, and matches the standard inverse-variance-weighted method's performance for the remainder of the data. The proposed method is especially effective for short baselines, both in visibility and image space. Improved direction-dependent gain-calibration is critical for future high-precision SKA-low observations, where higher sensitivity, increased antenna beam complexity, and mutual coupling call for better off-axis source subtraction, which may not be achieved through improved beam models alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple field theory model with reduced invariance under diffeomorphisms whose energy-momentum tensor is identical to the sum of pressureless irrotational matter and a cosmological constant. The model action is built from a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term without any potential or Lagrange multiplier terms. The coupling to gravity is realized through a particular transverse diffeomorphism invariant volume element. The corresponding sound speed is exactly zero in any background geometry and the model is dynamically identical to $\Lambda$CDM. By restoring the full diffeomorphism invariance through the introduction of Stueckelberg-like fields, we obtain an equivalent local scalar-vector theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently released data from the $\textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope}$ (ACT) confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a minimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking arbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries, we argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms.</description>

      <title>Probing patchy reionisation with JWST: IGM opacity constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of galaxies in legacy extragalactic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range $4\lesssim z\lesssim 7$, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-$\beta$ opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST $z&gt;5$ galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-$\beta$ opacity at $5&lt;z&lt;6$. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at $z=5.8-5.9$ coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-$\alpha$ at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of $M_{\rm{UV}}\lesssim -10$ galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have $\log_{10}\langle \xi_{\rm{ion}} f_{\rm{esc}} / \ [\rm{erg}^{-1}\rm{Hz}]\rangle = 24.7$ (or equivalently $\log_{10}\xi_{\rm{ion}} / \ [\rm{erg}^{-1}\rm{Hz}]=25.4$ and $f_{\rm{esc}}=20\%$). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.</description>

Abstract: In light of the latest results from ACT observations we review a class of potentials labeled as fractional attractors, that can originate from Palatini gravity. We show in a model independent way that this class of potentials predicts both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ which fit the $1\sigma$ region of the combination ACT+Planck data for a wide choice of the parameters. We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this models in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Implications of Pulsar Timing Array Results for High Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments such as NANOGrav and PPTA recently reported evidence of a gravitational wave (GW) background at nano-Hz frequency band. This signal can originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW) generated by the enhanced curvature perturbation. Production of SIGW is expected to be accompanied by formation of primordial black holes (PBH), which can emit GW through binary mergers. Here we perform a joint likelihood inference on PTA datasets in combination with existing limits on PBH abundance and GW density, we derive full Bayesian posteriors for PBH distribution and relevant PBH merger signal. Our results show that analysis using PTA data alone implies significant overproduction of PBHs, and accounting for current PBH limits causes visible shifts in SIGW posterior. If PTA signals are indeed of SIGW origin, the required curvature perturbation amplitude produces PBHs in a narrow mass window of $[6 \times 10^{-2}, 2 \times 10^{-1}]\ m_\odot$. Mergers of these PBHs can leave a strong GW signature in $[10^{-3}, 10^5]$ Hz frequency range, to be detectable at upcoming interferometers such as LISA, aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, DECIGO and BBO, etc. This offers a multi-frequency opportunity to further scrutinize the source of the observed PTA signal and can potentially improve current PBH constraints by up to 5 orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultralight dark photon is a well-motivated, hypothetical dark matter candidate. In a dilute plasma, they can resonantly convert into photons, and heat up the intergalactic medium between galaxies. In this work, we explore the dark photon dark matter parameter space by comparing synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to observational data from VLT/UVES of the quasar HE0940-1050 ($z_{\rm em}=3.09$). We use a novel flux normalization technique that targets under-dense gas, reshaping the flux probability distribution. Not only do we place robust constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter of dark photon dark matter, but notably our findings suggest that this model can still reconcile simulated and observed Doppler parameter distributions of $z\sim0$ Lyman-$\alpha$ lines, as seen by HST/COS. This work opens new pathways for the use of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to explore new physics, and can be extended to other scenarios such as primordial black hole evaporation, dark matter decay, and annihilation.</description>

      <title>Gravothermalizing into primordial black holes, boson stars, and cannibal stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very little is known about the cosmological history from after the end of inflation until Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. We thus propose a novel scenario for the formation of primordial black holes, which in particular can lie within the asteroid-mass range. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. We show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a ``cannibal star''. Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Stage IV CMB forecasts for warm inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report forecast constraints on warm inflation in the light of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys, with data expected to be available in the coming decade. These observations could finally give us the missing information necessary to unveil the production of gravitational waves during inflation, reflected by the detection of a non-zero tensor-to-scalar ratio crucial to the B-mode power spectrum of the CMB. We consider the impact of three future surveys, namely the CMB-S4, Simons Observatory, and the space-borne $\textit{LiteBIRD}$, in restricting the parameter space of four typical warm inflationary models in the context of a quartic potential, which is well motivated theoretically. We find that all three surveys significantly improve the models' parameter space, compared to recent results obtained with current $\textit{Planck}$+BICEP/Keck Array data. Moreover, the combination of ground-based and space-borne (SO+$\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and CMB-S4+$\textit{LiteBIRD}$) surveys tightens the constraints so that we expect to distinguish even better warm inflation scenarios. This result becomes clear when we compare the models' predictions with a $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ forecast, compatible with $r=0$, in which one of them already becomes excluded by data.</description>

      <title>Measuring our peculiar velocity from spectroscopic redshift surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our peculiar velocity imprints a dipole on galaxy density maps derived from redshift surveys. The dipole gives rise to an oscillatory signal in the multipole moments of the observed power spectrum which we indicate as the finger-of-the-observer (FOTO) effect. Using a suite of large mock catalogues mimicking ongoing and future $\textrm{H}\alpha$- and $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$-selected surveys, we demonstrate that the oscillatory features can be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 7 (depending on the sky area coverage and provided that observational systematics are kept under control on large scales). We also show that the FOTO effect cannot be erased by correcting the individual galaxy redshifts. On the contrary, by leveraging the power of the redshift corrections, we propose a novel method to determine both the magnitude and the direction of our peculiar velocity. After applying this technique to our mock catalogues, we conclude that it can be used to either test the kinematic interpretation of the temperature dipole in the cosmic microwave background or to extract cosmological information such as the matter density parameter and the equation of state of dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Cluster Clustering Covariance Calibration</title>

Abstract: Ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys at different wavelengths will measure the distribution of galaxy clusters with unprecedented precision, demanding accurate models for the two-point correlation function (2PCF) covariance. In this work, we assess a semi-analytical framework for the cluster 2PCF covariance that employs three nuisance parameters to account for non-Poissonian shot noise, residual uncertainties in the halo bias model, and subleading noise terms. We calibrate these parameters on a suite of fast approximate simulations generated by PINOCCHIO as well as full $N$-body simulations from OpenGADGET3. We demonstrate that PINOCCHIO can reproduce the 2PCF covariance measured in OpenGADGET3 at the few percent level, provided the mass functions are carefully rescaled. Resolution tests confirm that high particle counts are necessary to capture shot-noise corrections, especially at high redshifts. We perform the parameter calibration across multiple cosmological models, showing that one of the nuisance parameters, the non-Poissonian shot-noise correction $\alpha$, depends mildly on the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$. In contrast, the remaining two parameters, $\beta$ controlling the bias correction and $\gamma$ controlling the secondary shot-noise correction, exhibit more significant variation with redshift and halo mass. Overall, our results underscore the importance of calibrating covariance models on realistic mock catalogs that replicate the selection function of forthcoming surveys and highlight that approximate methods, when properly tuned, can effectively complement full $N$-body simulations for precision cluster cosmology.</description>

      <title>Extended Dark Energy analysis using DESI DR2 BAO measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an extended analysis of dark energy constraints, in support of the findings of the DESI DR2 cosmology key paper, including DESI data, Planck CMB observations, and three different supernova compilations. Using a broad range of parametric and non-parametric methods, we explore the dark energy phenomenology and find consistent trends across all approaches, in good agreement with the $w_0w_a$CDM key paper results. Even with the additional flexibility introduced by non-parametric approaches, such as binning and Gaussian Processes, we find that extending $\Lambda$CDM to include a two-parameter $w(z)$ is sufficient to capture the trends present in the data. Finally, we examine three dark energy classes with distinct dynamics, including quintessence scenarios satisfying $w \geq -1$, to explore what underlying physics can explain such deviations. The current data indicate a clear preference for models that feature a phantom crossing; although alternatives lacking this feature are disfavored, they cannot yet be ruled out. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$), is robust and stable under different modeling choices.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Neutrino Physics from DESI DR2 BAO and DR1 Full Shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has obtained robust measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the redshift range, $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4.2$, based on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and galaxies from Data Release 2 (DR2). We combine these measurements with external cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT to place our tightest constraints yet on the sum of neutrino masses. Assuming the cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model and three degenerate neutrino states, we find $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.0642$ eV (95%). When accounting for neutrino oscillation constraints, we find a preference for the normal mass ordering and an upper bound of $m_l &lt; 0.023$ eV (95%) on the lightest neutrino mass. However, we determine using frequentist and Bayesian methods that our constraints are in moderate tension with the lower limits derived from neutrino oscillations. Correcting for the physical boundary at zero mass, we report a 95% Feldman-Cousins upper bound of $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.053$ eV, breaching the lower limit from neutrino oscillations. Considering a more general Bayesian analysis with an effective cosmological neutrino mass parameter, $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}}$, that allows for negative energy densities and removes unsatisfactory prior weight effects, we derive constraints that are in $3\sigma$ tension with the same oscillation limit. In the absence of unknown systematics, this finding could be interpreted as a hint of new physics not necessarily related to neutrinos. The preference of DESI and CMB data for an evolving dark energy model offers one possible solution. In the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.163$ eV (95%), resolving the neutrino tension.

      <title>The mass accretion history of dark matter haloes down to Earth mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take advantage of the unprecedented dynamical range provided by the "Cosmic-Zoom" project to study the mass accretion history (MAH) of present-day dark matter haloes over the entire mass range present in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm when the dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles of mass $100\ \mathrm{GeV}$. In particular, we complement previous studies by exploring the MAHs of haloes with mass from $10^8\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ down to Earth mass, $10^{-6}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The formation redshift of low-mass haloes anti-correlates weakly with mass, peaking at $z=3$ for haloes of mass $10^{-4}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Even lower masses are affected by the free-streaming cutoff in the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations and form at lower redshift. We compare MAHs in our simulations with predictions from two analytical models based on the extended Press-Schechter theory (EPS), and three empirical models derived by fitting and extrapolating either results from cosmological $N$-body simulations or Monte Carlo realizations of halo growth. All models fit our simulations reasonably well over the mass range for which they were calibrated. While the empirical models match better for more massive haloes, $M&gt;10^{10}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, the analytical models do better when extrapolated down to Earth mass. At the higher masses, we explore the correlation between local environment density and MAH, finding that biases are relatively weak, with typical MAHs for haloes in extremely low-density and in typical regions differing by less than $20$ percent at high redshift. If this result can be extrapolated to lower halo masses, we conclude that EPS theory predicts the hierarchical build-up of dark matter haloes quite well over the entire halo mass range.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological constraints using gravitational wave memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The {\Lambda}CDM model has long served as a robust and predictive framework for cosmology, successfully explaining a wide range of observations, including the accelerated expansion of the Universe. However, discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and recent findings, such as those from DESI, hint at potential deviations from {\Lambda}CDM. Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer an independent method to probe the nature of dark energy, leveraging GWs from compact binary mergers as standard candles. In this study, we demonstrate that the integrated GW memory over cosmological distances encodes a unique imprint of the background spacetime. Unlike previous analyses, our approach captures non-linear dependencies on cosmological quantities, resulting in an enhancement of the integrated GW memory by a factor of 100 for high-redshift sources well within the sensitivity range of next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. We find that despite the diminishing strength of individual GWs at high redshifts, their cumulative effect leads to a significant amplification, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, offering a potential new avenue for cosmological studies. By examining a range of dark energy models, we reveal that GW memory is potentially highly sensitive to the underlying cosmological framework, making it a promising probe of dark energy. This novel approach presents the possibility of a fresh perspective to address persistent cosmological tensions, and the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure I: a running threshold for thin discs and size predictors from the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between galaxy morphology and host dark matter (DM) halo structure using cosmological simulations. Introducing a new kinematic decomposition scheme, we robustly separate thin and thick discs and measure halo properties, including cosmic web locations, internal structures, and assembly histories. In the TNG50 simulation, we find that the orbital-circularity threshold for disc differentiation varies systematically with galaxy mass and redshift. Similarly, the energy threshold between stellar halos and inner galaxies depends on mass and redshift, minimizing at sub-Galactic halo mass where the circularity threshold approaches its peak. Revisiting galaxy size predictors, we show that disc sizes in TNG50 correlate with three structural parameters beyond virial mass and redshift: 1) a positive correlation with halo spin $\lambda$ across redshifts -- stronger than previously reported for zoom-in simulations but still weaker than the simple $r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir} \propto \lambda$ scaling; 2) an anti-correlation with DM concentration $c$; 3) larger discs in more actively accreting haloes. Disc mass fraction is higher in rounder haloes and in cosmic knots and filaments, implying that disc development needs both stable halo conditions and continuous material supply. Our methodology is public and adaptable to other simulations.</description>

      <title>High-Scale SUSY from Sgoldstino Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review a number of unimodular no-scale supergravity models with F-term SUSY breaking which support technically natural de Sitter vacua. A variant of these models develops a stage of inflection-point inflation which can be realized for subplanckian field values consistently with the observational data. For central value of the spectral index ns, the necessary tuning is of the order of 10^-6, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is tiny whereas the running of ns is around -3x10^-3. Our proposal is compatible with high-scale SUSY and the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter Production through the Bubble Expansion Mechanism:The Role of the Lorentz factor and Non-Renormalizable Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bubble Expansion mechanism for the production of scalar dark matter during a first-order phase transition in the very early Universe. Seeking for a dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field undergoing the transition, considering all possible regimes for the Lorentz boost factor associated with the motion of the bubble wall. By employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate that sufficient dark matter production is achievable even in the previously unexplored low-velocity bubble expansion regime, enlarging the parameter space and possibilities of the scenario. Notably, for the non-renormalizable interactions it is found that the produced dark matter abundances exhibit a similar qualitative behavior to the renormalizable case, even for low Lorentz boost factors. Furthermore, for a transition around the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is within the reach of future detectors.</description>

      <title>Back to the origins of brane-antibrane inflation</title>

Abstract: We study a new framework for brane-antibrane inflation where moduli stabilisation relies purely on perturbative corrections to the effective action. This guarantees that the model does not suffer from the eta-problem. The inflationary potential has two contributions: the tension of an antibrane at the tip of a warped throat, and its Coulomb interaction with a mobile brane. This represents the first realisation of the original idea of brane-antibrane inflation, as opposed to inflection point inflation which arises when the moduli are fixed with non-perturbative effects. Moreover, we formulate the brane-antibrane dynamics as an F-term potential of a nilpotent superfield in a manifestly supersymmetric effective theory. We impose compatibility with data and consistency conditions on control over the approximations and find that slow-roll inflation can occur in a large region of the underlying parameter space. The scalar spectral index is in agreement with data and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is beyond current observational reach. Interestingly, after the end of inflation the volume mode can, but does not need to, evolve towards a late-time minimum at larger values.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Axion Dark Matter Searches at LISA-like Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion or axionlike particles are one of the leading candidates for dark matter. Because of its tiny coupling with photons, axion dark matter in the background can induce distinct phase velocities for light with different parity, an effect known as birefringence. Here, we propose a modification to the polarization state of the interspacecraft laser link in LISA-like interferometers to make them sensitive to this birefringence effect. We discuss the prospects of using the Sagnac combinations to search for axion dark matter and derive the corresponding sensitivity. With this setup, we show that next-generation laser interferometers in space would have promising sensitivities on the axion-photon coupling with axion mass around $10^{-19} - 10^{-14}~\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Metastable Cosmic Strings in Supersymmetric New Inflation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) indicate a potential detection of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Metastable cosmic strings have been recognized as a possible source of the observed signals. In this paper, we propose an $R$-invariant supersymmetric new inflation model. It is characterized by a two-step symmetry breaking $\mathrm{SU}(2) \to \mathrm{U}(1)_G \to \mathrm{nothing}$, incorporating metastable cosmic strings. The field responsible for the initial symmetry breaking acts as the inflaton, while the second symmetry breaking occurs post-inflation, ensuring the formation of the cosmic string network without monopole production. Our model predicts symmetry breaking scales consistent with the string tensions favored by PTA data, $G_\mathrm{N} \mu_\mathrm{str} \sim 10^{-5}$, where $G_\mathrm{N}$ is the Newton constant. Notably, a low reheating temperature is required to suppress non-thermal gravitino production from the decay of inflaton sector fields. This also helps evading LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, while yielding a distinctive GW signature that future PTA and interferometer experiments can detect. Additionally, we examine the consistency of this scenario with non-thermal leptogenesis and supersymmetric dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy from an ultralight axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration presented evidence that the equation of state $w$ of the dark energy is varying, or $w \simeq -0.948$ if it is constant. In either case, the dark energy cannot be due to a cosmological constant alone. Here we study an ultralight axion (or axion-like particle) with mass $m_\phi \simeq 2 \times 10^{-33}$ eV that has properties that can explain the new $w$ measurement. In particular, $w\ge -1$ and a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda &lt; 0$ is preferred in this model. We also present a simple formula for $w$ for the model to ease data fitting.</description>
