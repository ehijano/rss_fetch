      <title>gpu_tracker: Python package for tracking and profiling GPU utilization in both desktop and high-performance computing environments</title>

Abstract: Determining the maximum usage of random-access memory (RAM) on both the motherboard and on a graphical processing unit (GPU) over the lifetime of a computing task can be extremely useful for troubleshooting points of failure as well as optimizing memory utilization, especially within a high-performance computing (HPC) setting. While there are tools for tracking compute time and RAM, including by job management tools themselves, tracking of GPU usage, to our knowledge, does not currently have sufficient solutions. We present gpu_tracker, a Python package that tracks the computational resource usage of a task while running in the background, including the real compute time that the task takes to complete, its maximum RAM usage, and the maximum GPU RAM usage, specifically for Nvidia GPUs. We demonstrate that gpu_tracker can seamlessly track computational resource usage with minimal overhead, both within desktop and HPC execution environments.</description>

      <title>Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users, thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.</description>
