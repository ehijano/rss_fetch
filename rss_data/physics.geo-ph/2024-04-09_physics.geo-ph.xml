      <title>Predicting the Geothermal Gradient in Colombia: a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the geothermal gradient is critical for assessing the geothermal energy potential of a given region. Of particular interest is the case of Colombia, a country with abundant geothermal resources. A history of active oil and gas exploration and production has left drilled boreholes in different geological settings, providing direct measurements of the geothermal gradient. Unfortunately, large regions of the country where geothermal resources might exist lack such measurements. Indirect geophysical measurements are costly and difficult to perform at regional scales. Computational thermal models could be constructed, but they require very detailed knowledge of the underlying geology and uniform sampling of subsurface temperatures to be well-constrained. We present an alternative approach that leverages recent advances in supervised machine learning and available direct measurements to predict the geothermal gradient in regions where only global-scale geophysical datasets and course geological knowledge are available. We find that a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree algorithm yields optimal predictions and extensively validate the trained model. We show that predictions of our model are within 12\% accuracy and that independent measurements performed by other authors agree well with our model. Finnally, we present a geothermal gradient map for Colombia that highlights regions where futher exploration and data collection should be performed.</description>

      <title>Mapping finite-fault slip with spatial correlation between seismicity and point-source Coulomb failure stress change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most earthquake energy release arises during fault slip many kilometers below the Earth's surface. Understanding earthquakes and their hazard requires mapping the geometry and amount of this slip. Such finite-fault maps are typically derived from measures of surface phenomena, such as seismic and geodetic ground motions. Here we introduce a procedure for mapping finite-fault slip directly from seismicity and aftershocks-phenomena occurring at depth around an earthquake rupture. For specified source and receiver faults, we map source-fault slip in 3D by correlation of point-source Coulomb failure stress change ({\Delta}CFS) kernels across the distribution of seismicity around an earthquake. These seismicity-stress maps show relative, static fault slip compatible with the surrounding seismicity under the physics of {\Delta}CFS; they can aid other slip inversions and aftershock forecasting, and be obtained for early instrumental earthquakes. We verify the maps recover synthetic fault slip and match independent estimates of slip for the 2004 Mw 6.0 Parkfield and 2021 Mw 6.0 Antelope Valley California earthquakes. For the 2018 Mw 7.1 Anchorage Alaska intra-slab earthquake, seismicity-stress maps, combined with multi-scale precise hypocenter relocation, resolve the enigma of which mainshock faulting plane ruptured (the gently east-dipping plane), and clarify slab structures activated in the energetic aftershock sequence.</description>

      <title>Seismic traveltime simulation for variable velocity models using physics-informed Fourier neural operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic traveltime is critical information conveyed by seismic waves, widely utilized in various geophysical applications. Conventionally, the simulation of seismic traveltime involves solving the eikonal equation. However, the efficiency of traditional numerical solvers is hindered, as they are typically capable of simulating seismic traveltime for only a single source at a time. Recently, deep learning tools, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), have proven effective in simulating seismic traveltimes for multiple sources. Nonetheless, PINNs face challenges such as limited generalization capabilities across different models and difficulties in training convergence. To address these issues, we have developed a method for simulating multi-source seismic traveltimes in variable velocity models using a deep-learning technique, known as the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). The PIFNO-based method for seismic traveltime generation takes both velocity and background traveltime as inputs, generating the perturbation traveltime as the output. This method incorporates a factorized eikonal equation as the loss function and relies solely on physical laws, eliminating the need for labeled training data. We demonstrate that our proposed method is not only effective in calculating seismic traveltimes for velocity models used during training but also shows promising prediction capabilities for test velocity models. We validate these features using velocity models from the OpenFWI dataset.</description>
