      <title>TrojanDec: Data-free Detection of Trojan Inputs in Self-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An image encoder pre-trained by self-supervised learning can be used as a general-purpose feature extractor to build downstream classifiers for various downstream tasks. However, many studies showed that an attacker can embed a trojan into an encoder such that multiple downstream classifiers built based on the trojaned encoder simultaneously inherit the trojan behavior. In this work, we propose TrojanDec, the first data-free method to identify and recover a test input embedded with a trigger. Given a (trojaned or clean) encoder and a test input, TrojanDec first predicts whether the test input is trojaned. If not, the test input is processed in a normal way to maintain the utility. Otherwise, the test input will be further restored to remove the trigger. Our extensive evaluation shows that TrojanDec can effectively identify the trojan (if any) from a given test input and recover it under state-of-the-art trojan attacks. We further demonstrate by experiments that our TrojanDec outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses.</description>

      <title>VerifBFL: Leveraging zk-SNARKs for A Verifiable Blockchained Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without relying on a central server. Although some BFL frameworks are considered privacy-preserving, they are still vulnerable to various attacks, including inference and model poisoning. Additionally, most of these solutions employ strong trust assumptions among all participating entities or introduce incentive mechanisms to encourage collaboration, making them susceptible to multiple security flaws. This work presents VerifBFL, a trustless, privacy-preserving, and verifiable federated learning framework that integrates blockchain technology and cryptographic protocols. By employing zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), VerifBFL ensures the verifiability of both local training and aggregation processes. The proofs of training and aggregation are verified on-chain, guaranteeing the integrity and auditability of each participant's contributions. To protect training data from inference attacks, VerifBFL leverages differential privacy. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocols, we built a proof of concept using emerging tools. The results show that generating proofs for local training and aggregation in VerifBFL takes less than 81s and 2s, respectively, while verifying them on-chain takes less than 0.6s.</description>

      <title>Real-world actor-based image steganalysis via classifier inconsistency detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust method for detecting guilty actors in image steganography while effectively addressing the Cover Source Mismatch (CSM) problem, which arises when classifying images from one source using a classifier trained on images from another source. Designed for an actor-based scenario, our method combines the use of Detection of Classifier Inconsistencies (DCI) prediction with EfficientNet neural networks for feature extraction, and a Gradient Boosting Machine for the final classification. The proposed approach successfully determines whether an actor is innocent or guilty, or if they should be discarded due to excessive CSM. We show that the method remains reliable even in scenarios with high CSM, consistently achieving accuracy above 80% and outperforming the baseline method. This novel approach contributes to the field of steganalysis by offering a practical and efficient solution for handling CSM and detecting guilty actors in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Modern Hardware Security: A Review of Attacks and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential rise in the use of cloud services, smart devices, and IoT devices, advanced cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of computing architectures and memory technologies has created an urgent need to understand and address hardware security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review the current state of vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in contemporary computing systems. We discuss cache side-channel attacks (including Spectre and Meltdown), power side-channel attacks (such as Simple Power Analysis, Differential Power Analysis, Correlation Power Analysis, and Template Attacks), and advanced techniques like Voltage Glitching and Electromagnetic Analysis to help understand and build robust cybersecurity defense systems and guide further research. We also examine memory encryption, focusing on confidentiality, granularity, key management, masking, and re-keying strategies. Additionally, we cover Cryptographic Instruction Set Architectures, Secure Boot, Root of Trust mechanisms, Physical Unclonable Functions, and hardware fault injection techniques. The paper concludes with an analysis of the RISC-V architecture's unique security challenges. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is essential for building resilient hardware security solutions that can protect against both current and emerging threats in an increasingly challenging security landscape.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Functional Security Features and How They Can Be Located</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security must be considered in almost every software system. Unfortunately, selecting and implementing security features remains challenging due to the variety of security threats and possible countermeasures. While security standards are intended to help developers, they are usually too abstract and vague to help implement security features, or they merely help configure such. A resource that describes security features at an abstraction level between high-level (i.e., rather too general) and low-level (i.e., rather too specific) security standards could facilitate secure systems development. To realize security features, developers typically use external security frameworks, to minimize implementation mistakes. Even then, developers still make mistakes, often resulting in security vulnerabilities. When security incidents occur or the system needs to be audited or maintained, it is essential to know the implemented security features and, more importantly, where they are located. This task, commonly referred to as feature location, is often tedious and error-prone. Therefore, we have to support long-term tracking of implemented security features.
  We present a study of security features in the literature and their coverage in popular security frameworks. We contribute (1) a taxonomy of 68 functional implementation-level security features including a mapping to widely used security standards, (2) an examination of 21 popular security frameworks concerning which of these security features they provide, and (3) a discussion on the representation of security features in source code. Our taxonomy aims to aid developers in selecting appropriate security features and frameworks and relating them to security standards when they need to choose and implement security features for a software system.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Steganography: A Provably Secure Hybrid Steganographic Model for Secure Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel steganographic model that synthesizes Steganography by Cover Modification (CMO) and Steganography by Cover Synthesis (CSY), enhancing both security and undetectability by generating cover messages or parameters while retaining the original cover's form, thus minimizing detection risks and overcoming the limitations of single-method techniques. Building upon this model, a refined Steganographic Communication Protocol is proposed, enhancing resilience against sophisticated threats such as Multichannel Replay Attacks and Multichannel Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, fortifying the protocol against potential tampering and improving upon prior works. To evaluate the security of the proposed protocol, a novel adversarial model is developed simulating a probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) adversary capable of intercepting communications across multiple channels. This model assesses the adversary's ability to compromise the protocol, providing a comprehensive security analysis. Finally, this study explores the practicality and adaptability of the model to both constrained environments like SMS banking and resource-rich settings such as blockchain transactions, demonstrating their potential to enhance financial services and security. These contributions present a robust and adaptable framework for secure steganographic communication, offering practical solutions for secure communications across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Scalable Data Notarization Leveraging Hybrid DLTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notarization is a procedure that enhance data management by ensuring the authentication of data during audits, thereby increasing trust in the audited data. Blockchain is frequently used as a secure, immutable, and transparent storage, contributing to make data notarization procedures more effective and trustable. Several blockchain-based data notarization protocols have been proposed in literature and commercial solutions. However, these implementations, whether on public or private blockchains, face inherent challenges: high fees on public blockchains and trust issues on private platforms, limiting the adoption of blockchains for data notarization or forcing several trade-offs. In this paper, we explore the use of hybrid blockchain architectures for data notarization, with a focus on scalability issues. Through the analysis of a real-world use case, the data notarization of product passports in supply chains, we propose a novel approach utilizing a data structure designed to efficiently manage the trade-offs in terms of storage occupation and costs involved in notarizing a large collection of data.</description>

      <title>Goldilocks Isolation: High Performance VMs with Edera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizations run applications on cloud infrastructure shared between multiple users and organizations. Popular tooling for this shared infrastructure, including Docker and Kubernetes, supports such multi-tenancy through the use of operating system virtualization. With operating system virtualization (known as containerization), multiple applications share the same kernel, reducing the runtime overhead. However, this shared kernel presents a large attack surface and has led to a proliferation of container escape attacks in which a kernel exploit lets an attacker escape the isolation of operating system virtualization to access other applications or the operating system itself. To address this, some systems have proposed a return to hypervisor virtualization for stronger isolation between applications. However, no existing system has achieved both the isolation of hypervisor virtualization and the performance and usability of operating system virtualization.
  We present Edera, an optimized type 1 hypervisor that uses paravirtualization to improve the runtime of hypervisor virtualization. We illustrate Edera's usability and performance through two use cases. First, we create a container runtime compatible with Kubernetes that runs on the Edera hypervisor. This implementation can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Kubernetes runtime and is compatible with all the tooling in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Second, we use Edera to provide driver isolation for hardware drivers, including those for networking, storage, and GPUs. This use of isolation protects the hypervisor and other applications from driver vulnerabilities. We find that Edera has runtime comparable to Docker with .9% slower cpu speeds, an average of 3% faster system call performance, and memory performance 0-7% faster. It achieves this with a 648 millisecond increase in startup time from Docker's 177.4 milliseconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focussing on two different use cases-Quality Control methods in industrial contexts and Neural Network algorithms for healthcare diagnostics-this research investigates the inclusion of Fully Homomorphic Encryption into real-world applications in the healthcare sector. We evaluate the performance, resource requirements, and viability of deploying FHE in these settings through extensive testing and analysis, highlighting the progress made in FHE tooling and the obstacles still facing addressing the gap between conceptual research and practical applications. We start our research by describing the specific case study and trust model were working with. Choosing the two FHE frameworks most appropriate for industry development, we assess the resources and performance requirements for implementing each of the two FHE frameworks in the first scenario, Quality Control algorithms. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and resource consumption of the two use cases-complex NN models and simple QC algorithms-when implemented in an FHE setting.</description>

      <title>Security by Design Issues in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous vehicle (AV) technology advances towards maturity, it becomes imperative to examine the security vulnerabilities within these cyber-physical systems. While conventional cyber-security concerns are often at the forefront of discussions, it is essential to get deeper into the various layers of vulnerability that are often overlooked within mainstream frameworks. Our goal is to spotlight imminent challenges faced by AV operators and explore emerging technologies for comprehensive solutions. This research outlines the diverse security layers, spanning physical, cyber, coding, and communication aspects, in the context of AVs. Furthermore, we provide insights into potential solutions for each potential attack vector, ensuring that autonomous vehicles remain secure and resilient in an evolving threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Memories from Stateless Hardware, Random Access Codes, and Simple Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of one-time memories (OTMs) using classical-accessible stateless hardware, building upon the work of Broadbent et al. and Behera et al.. Unlike the aforementioned work, our approach leverages quantum random access codes (QRACs) to encode two classical bits, $b_0$ and $b_1$, into a single qubit state $\mathcal{E}(b_0 b_1)$ where the receiver can retrieve one of the bits with a certain probability of error. To prove soundness, we define a nonconvex optimization problem over POVMs on $\mathbb{C}^2$. This optimization gives an upper bound on the probability of distinguishing bit $b_{1-\alpha}$ given that the probability that the receiver recovers bit $b_\alpha$ is high. Assuming the optimization is sufficiently accurate, we then prove soundness against a polynomial number of classical queries to the hardware.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Algorithms for Multi-way Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cloud databases, cloud computation over sensitive data uploaded by clients inevitably causes concern about data security and privacy. Even when encryption primitives and trusted computing environments are integrated into query processing to safeguard the actual contents of the data, access patterns of algorithms can still leak private information about the data. Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM) and circuits are two generic approaches to address this issue, ensuring that access patterns of algorithms remain oblivious to the data. However, deploying these methods on insecure algorithms, particularly for multi-way join processing, is computationally expensive and inherently challenging.
  In this paper, we propose a novel sorting-based algorithm for multi-way join processing that operates without relying on ORAM simulations or other security assumptions. Our algorithm is a non-trivial, provably oblivious composition of basic primitives, with time complexity matching the insecure worst-case optimal join algorithm, up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, it is cache-agnostic, with cache complexity matching the insecure lower bound, also up to a logarithmic factor. This clean and straightforward approach has the potential to be extended to other security settings and implemented in practical database systems.</description>

      <title>A note on the differential spectrum of a class of locally APN functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\gf_{p^n}$ denote the finite field containing $p^n$ elements, where $n$ is a positive integer and $p$ is a prime. The function $f_u(x)=x^{\frac{p^n+3}{2}}+ux^2$ over $\gf_{p^n}[x]$ with $u\in\gf_{p^n}\setminus\{0,\pm1\}$ was recently studied by Budaghyan and Pal in \cite{Budaghyan2024ArithmetizationorientedAP}, whose differential uniformity is at most $5$ when $p^n\equiv3~(mod~4)$. In this paper, we study the differential uniformity and the differential spectrum of $f_u$ for $u=\pm1$. We first give some properties of the differential spectrum of any cryptographic function. Moreover, by solving some systems of equations over finite fields, we express the differential spectrum of $f_{\pm1}$ in terms of the quadratic character sums.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Designs of Privacy-Preserving Fine-tuning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning has proven effective in enhancing Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance on downstream tasks. However, real-world fine-tuning faces inherent conflicts between model providers' intellectual property protection, clients' data privacy requirements, and tuning costs. While recent approaches like split learning and offsite tuning demonstrate promising architectures for privacy-preserving fine-tuning, there is a gap in systematically addressing the multidimensional trade-offs required for diverse real-world deployments. We propose several indicative evaluation metrics to guide design trade-offs for privacy-preserving fine-tuning and a series of example designs, collectively named GuardedTuning; they result from novel combinations of system architectures with adapted privacy-enhancement methods and emerging computation techniques. Each design represents distinct trade-offs across model utility, privacy guarantees, and costs. Experimental results demonstrate that these designs protect against data reconstruction attacks while maintaining competitive fine-tuning performance.</description>

Abstract: Blockchained federated learning (BFL) combines the concepts of federated learning and blockchain technology to enhance privacy, security, and transparency in collaborative machine learning models. However, implementing BFL frameworks poses challenges in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness. Reputation-aware BFL poses even more challenges, as blockchain validators are tasked with processing federated learning transactions along with the transactions that evaluate FL tasks and aggregate reputations. This leads to faster blockchain congestion and performance degradation. To improve BFL efficiency while increasing scalability and reducing on-chain reputation management costs, this paper proposes AutoDFL, a scalable and automated reputation-aware decentralized federated learning framework. AutoDFL leverages zk-Rollups as a Layer-2 scaling solution to boost the performance while maintaining the same level of security as the underlying Layer-1 blockchain. Moreover, AutoDFL introduces an automated and fair reputation model designed to incentivize federated learning actors. We develop a proof of concept for our framework for an accurate evaluation. Tested with various custom workloads, AutoDFL reaches an average throughput of over 3000 TPS with a gas reduction of up to 20X.</description>

      <title>Cyber-Physical Steganography in Robotic Motion Control</title>

Abstract: Steganography, the art of information hiding, has continually evolved across visual, auditory and linguistic domains, adapting to the ceaseless interplay between steganographic concealment and steganalytic revelation. This study seeks to extend the horizons of what constitutes a viable steganographic medium by introducing a steganographic paradigm in robotic motion control. Based on the observation of the robot's inherent sensitivity to changes in its environment, we propose a methodology to encode messages as environmental stimuli influencing the motions of the robotic agent and to decode messages from the resulting motion trajectory. The constraints of maximal robot integrity and minimal motion deviation are established as fundamental principles underlying secrecy. As a proof of concept, we conduct experiments in simulated environments across various manipulation tasks, incorporating robotic embodiments equipped with generalist multimodal policies.</description>

      <title>Location Privacy Threats and Protections in 6G Vehicular Networks: A Comprehensive Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Location privacy is critical in vehicular networks, where drivers' trajectories and personal information can be exposed, allowing adversaries to launch data and physical attacks that threaten drivers' safety and personal security. This survey reviews comprehensively different localization techniques, including widely used ones like sensing infrastructure-based, optical vision-based, and cellular radio-based localization, and identifies inadequately addressed location privacy concerns. We classify Location Privacy Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs) into user-side, server-side, and user-server-interface-based, and evaluate their effectiveness. Our analysis shows that the user-server-interface-based LPPMs have received insufficient attention in the literature, despite their paramount importance in vehicular networks. Further, we examine methods for balancing data utility and privacy protection for existing LPPMs in vehicular networks and highlight emerging challenges from future upper-layer location privacy attacks, wireless technologies, and network convergences. By providing insights into the relationship between localization techniques and location privacy, and evaluating the effectiveness of different LPPMs, this survey can help inform the development of future LPPMs in vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Consumer IoT Traffic from Security and Privacy Perspectives: a Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16149v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), a notable segment within the IoT domain, involves the integration of IoT technology into consumer electronics and devices, such as smart homes and smart wearables. Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to network traffic analysis in other fields such as mobile apps and websites, CIoT presents unique characteristics, introducing new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for studying CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 303 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.</description>

      <title>VeriFence: Lightweight and Precise Spectre Defenses for Untrusted Linux Kernel Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-performance IO demands low-overhead communication between user- and kernel space. This demand can no longer be fulfilled by traditional system calls. Linux's extended Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) avoids user-/kernel transitions by just-in-time compiling user-provided bytecode and executing it in kernel mode with near-native speed. To still isolate BPF programs from the kernel, they are statically analyzed for memory- and type-safety, which imposes some restrictions but allows for good expressiveness and high performance. However, to mitigate the Spectre vulnerabilities disclosed in 2018, defenses which reject potentially-dangerous programs had to be deployed. We find that this affects 31% to 54% of programs in a dataset with 844 real-world BPF programs from popular open-source projects. To solve this, users are forced to disable the defenses to continue using the programs, which puts the entire system at risk.
  To enable secure and expressive untrusted Linux kernel extensions, we propose VeriFence, an enhancement to the kernel's Spectre defenses that reduces the number of BPF application programs rejected from 54% to zero. We measure VeriFence's overhead for all mainstream performance-sensitive applications of BPF (i.e., event tracing, profiling, and packet processing) and find that it improves significantly upon the status-quo where affected BPF programs are either unusable or enable transient execution attacks on the kernel.</description>

      <title>Exploring Power Side-Channel Challenges in Embedded Systems Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power side-channel (PSC) attacks are widely used in embedded microcontrollers, particularly in cryptographic applications, to extract sensitive information. However, expanding the applications of PSC attacks to broader security contexts in the embedded systems domain faces significant challenges. These include the need for specialized hardware setups to manage high noise levels in real-world targets and assumptions regarding the attacker's knowledge and capabilities. This paper systematically analyzes these challenges and introduces a novel signal-processing method that addresses key limitations, enabling effective PSC attacks in real-world embedded systems without requiring hardware modifications. We validate the proposed approach through experiments on real-world black-box embedded devices, verifying its potential to expand its usage in various embedded systems security applications beyond traditional cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Toxicity Detection towards Adaptability to Changing Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toxicity detection is crucial for maintaining the peace of the society. While existing methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by specific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation patterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new perturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may circumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a scientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the toxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new dataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized from prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically validate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation pattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern detection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and the corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically emerging types of perturbed toxic text. Our code and dataset are provided in the appendix and will be publicly available at GitHub, by which we wish to offer new research opportunities for the security-relevant communities.</description>

      <title>LENS-XAI: Redefining Lightweight and Explainable Network Security through Knowledge Distillation and Variational Autoencoders for Scalable Intrusion Detection in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems necessitates advanced, interpretable, and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) to combat emerging cyber threats. Traditional IDS face challenges such as high computational demands, limited explainability, and inflexibility against evolving attack patterns. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Lightweight Explainable Network Security framework (LENS-XAI), which combines robust intrusion detection with enhanced interpretability and scalability. LENS-XAI integrates knowledge distillation, variational autoencoder models, and attribution-based explainability techniques to achieve high detection accuracy and transparency in decision-making. By leveraging a training set comprising 10% of the available data, the framework optimizes computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoTset, UKM-IDS20, CTU-13, and NSL-KDD, demonstrates the framework's superior performance, achieving detection accuracies of 95.34%, 99.92%, 98.42%, and 99.34%, respectively. Additionally, the framework excels in reducing false positives and adapting to complex attack scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Key strengths of LENS-XAI include its lightweight design, suitable for resource-constrained environments, and its scalability across diverse IIoT and cybersecurity contexts. Moreover, the explainability module enhances trust and transparency, critical for practical deployment in dynamic and sensitive applications. This research contributes significantly to advancing IDS by addressing computational efficiency, feature interpretability, and real-world applicability. Future work could focus on extending the framework to ensemble AI systems for distributed environments, further enhancing its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Byzantine Robustness in Federated Recommendation from Sparse Aggregation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To preserve user privacy in recommender systems, federated recommendation (FR) based on federated learning (FL) emerges, keeping the personal data on the local client and updating a model collaboratively. Unlike FL, FR has a unique sparse aggregation mechanism, where the embedding of each item is updated by only partial clients, instead of full clients in a dense aggregation of general FL. Recently, as an essential principle of FL, model security has received increasing attention, especially for Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients can send arbitrary updates. The problem of exploring the Byzantine robustness of FR is particularly critical since in the domains applying FR, e.g., e-commerce, malicious clients can be injected easily by registering new accounts. However, existing Byzantine works neglect the unique sparse aggregation of FR, making them unsuitable for our problem. Thus, we make the first effort to investigate Byzantine attacks on FR from the perspective of sparse aggregation, which is non-trivial: it is not clear how to define Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregations and design Byzantine attacks under limited knowledge/capability. In this paper, we reformulate the Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregation by defining the aggregation for a single item as the smallest execution unit. Then we propose a family of effective attack strategies, named Spattack, which exploit the vulnerability in sparse aggregation and are categorized along the adversary's knowledge and capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Spattack can effectively prevent convergence and even break down defenses under a few malicious clients, raising alarms for securing FR systems.</description>

      <title>To Err is Machine: Vulnerability Detection Challenges LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a challenging code reasoning task: vulnerability detection. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in natural-language and math reasoning, but state-of-the-art (SOTA) models reported only 54.5% Balanced Accuracy in our vulnerability detection evaluation, even those models pre-trained on large amounts of source code. Our error analysis on LLM responses shows that the models struggle to reason about the code semantics relevant to identifying vulnerabilities, especially subtle semantic differences caused by small textual changes. We explored prominent models and training settings to understand their effects on vulnerability detection performance -- including better prompts, larger models, more pre-training data, and fine-tuning -- but none led to significant improvements. This raises the question of whether simply scaling training data and model size will allow us to "solve" complex code reasoning tasks like vulnerability detection, or if a fundamental shift in modeling and training techniques is required. We also explored adding domain knowledge to prompts; although it helped certain models understand some code semantics, vulnerability detection requires multi-step reasoning, and these models still failed in steps, such as reasoning about variable relations. Our results suggest that new models, new training methods, or more execution-specific pretraining data may be needed to conquer vulnerability detection. We speculate that auto-regressive pre-training on source code may not effectively extract code semantics, especially on the current pretraining mixtures, in which execution data is scarce. Success on vulnerability detection as a code reasoning task can benefit many areas of software engineering such as debugging, test input generation, and program repair. Our code and data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27368025.</description>

      <title>Watch Out for Your Guidance on Generation! Exploring Conditional Backdoor Attacks against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14795v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically set a fixed trigger in the input instance and specific responses for triggered queries. However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor activation, we present a new poisoning paradigm against LLMs triggered by specifying generation conditions, which are commonly adopted strategies by users during model inference. The poisoned model performs normally for output under normal/other generation conditions, while becomes harmful for output under target generation conditions. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation conditions by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our attack can be generally divided into two types with different targets: Safety unalignment attack and Ability degradation attack. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and ability domains, achieving higher success rates than baseline methods, with 94.3 % on GPT-3.5-turbo</description>

      <title>Correlated Privacy Mechanisms for Differentially Private Distributed Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private distributed mean estimation (DP-DME) is a fundamental building block in privacy-preserving federated learning, where a central server estimates the mean of $d$-dimensional vectors held by $n$ users while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. Local differential privacy (LDP) and distributed DP with secure aggregation (SA) are the most common notions of DP used in DP-DME settings with an untrusted server. LDP provides strong resilience to dropouts, colluding users, and adversarial attacks, but suffers from poor utility. In contrast, SA-based DP-DME achieves an $O(n)$ utility gain over LDP in DME, but requires increased communication and computation overheads and complex multi-round protocols to handle dropouts and attacks. In this work, we present a generalized framework for DP-DME, that captures LDP and SA-based mechanisms as extreme cases. Our framework provides a foundation for developing and analyzing a variety of DP-DME protocols that leverage correlated privacy mechanisms across users. To this end, we propose CorDP-DME, a novel DP-DME mechanism based on the correlated Gaussian mechanism, that spans the gap between DME with LDP and distributed DP. We prove that CorDP-DME offers a favorable balance between utility and resilience to dropout and collusion. We provide an information-theoretic analysis of CorDP-DME, and derive theoretical guarantees for utility under any given privacy parameters and dropout/colluding user thresholds. Our results demonstrate that (anti) correlated Gaussian DP mechanisms can significantly improve utility in mean estimation tasks compared to LDP -- even in adversarial settings -- while maintaining better resilience to dropouts and attacks compared to distributed DP.</description>

      <title>MADation: Face Morphing Attack Detection with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the considerable performance improvements of face recognition algorithms in recent years, the same scientific advances responsible for this progress can also be used to create efficient ways to attack them, posing a threat to their secure deployment. Morphing attack detection (MAD) systems aim to detect a specific type of threat, morphing attacks, at an early stage, preventing them from being considered for verification in critical processes. Foundation models (FM) learn from extensive amounts of unlabeled data, achieving remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen domains. Although this generalization capacity might be weak when dealing with domain-specific downstream tasks such as MAD, FMs can easily adapt to these settings while retaining the built-in knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we recognize the potential of FMs to perform well in the MAD task when properly adapted to its specificities. To this end, we adapt FM CLIP architectures with LoRA weights while simultaneously training a classification header. The proposed framework, MADation surpasses our alternative FM and transformer-based frameworks and constitutes the first adaption of FMs to the MAD task. MADation presents competitive results with current MAD solutions in the literature and even surpasses them in several evaluation scenarios. To encourage reproducibility and facilitate further research in MAD, we publicly release the implementation of MADation at https: //github.com/gurayozgur/MADation</description>
