      <title>Equivariant unknotting numbers of strongly invertible knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetric crossing change operations for strongly invertible knots. Our main theorem is that the most natural notion of equivariant unknotting number is not additive under connected sum, in contrast with the longstanding conjecture that unknotting number is additive.</description>

      <title>On diffeomorphisms of 4-dimensional 1-handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of Laudenbach and Po\'enaru's theorem, which states that any diffeomorphism of the boundary of a 4-dimensional 1-handlebody extends to the whole handlebody. Our proof is based on the cassification of Heegaard splittings of double handlebodies and a result of Cerf on diffeomorphisms of the 3-ball. Further, we extend this theorem to 4-dimensional compression bodies, namely cobordisms between 3-manifolds constructed using only 1-handles: when the negative boundary is a product of a compact surface by interval, we show that every diffeomorphism of the positive boundary extends to the whole compression body. This invlolves a strong Haken theorem for sutured Heegaard splittings and a classification of sutured Heegaard splittings of double compression bodies. Finally, we show how this applies to the study of relative trisection diagrams for compact 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Giroux torsion in some Plumbed 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tight contact structures on plumbed 3-manifolds with no bad vertices. We discuss how one can count the number of tight contact structures with zero Giroux torsion on such 3-manifolds and explore conditions under which Giroux torsion can be added to these tight contact structures without making them overtwisted. We give an explicit algorithm to construct stein diagrams corresponding to tight structures without Giroux torsion. We focus mainly on plumbed 3-manifolds whose vertices have valence at most 3 and then briefly consider the situation for plumbed 3-manifolds with vertices of higher valence.</description>

      <title>Earthquake theorem for cluster algebras of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15226v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a cluster algebraic generalization of Thurston's earthquake map for the cluster algebras of finite type, which we call the \emph{cluster earthquake map}. It is defined by gluing exponential maps, which is modeled after the earthquakes along ideal arcs. We prove an analogue of the earthquake theorem, which states that the cluster earthquake map gives a homeomorphism between the spaces of $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{trop}$- and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued points of the cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety. For those of type $A_n$ and $D_n$, the cluster earthquake map indeed recovers the earthquake maps for marked disks and once-punctured marked disks, respectively. Moreover, we investigate certain asymptotic behaviors of the cluster earthquake map, which give rise to "continuous deformations" of the Fock--Goncharov fan.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>
