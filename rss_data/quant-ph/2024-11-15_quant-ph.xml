      <title>Revisiting the Laplace Transform in Quantum Mechanics: Correcting a Flawed Approach for the Stationary Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laplace transform is a valuable tool in physics, particularly in solving differential equations with initial or boundary conditions. A 2014 study by Tsaur and Wang (2014 \emph{Eur.~J.~Phys.} \textbf{35} 015006) introduced a Laplace-transform-based method to solve the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for various potentials. However, their approach contains critical methodological flaws: the authors disregard essential boundary conditions and apply the residue theorem incorrectly in the inverse transformation process. These errors ultimately cancel out, leading to correct results despite a flawed derivation. In this paper, we revisit the use of the Laplace transform for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation, clarifying correct practices in handling boundary conditions and singularities. This analysis offers a sound and consistent framework for the application of Laplace transforms in stationary quantum mechanics, underscoring their educational utility in quantum mechanics coursework.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocols, focusing on their behavior at finite temperatures and in excited states. We analyze the role of entanglement as a resource for QET, particularly in thermal states, and compare the performance of QET across various initial states. We then introduce a method to extract ground-state energy through a protocol that employs only quantum measurements, local operations, and classical communication (LOCC), without requiring the ground state to be entangled. To illustrate this, we propose a minimal model comprising two interacting qubits. These findings indicate that, in addition to the established QET framework where entanglement serves as a resource, it is possible to extract energy from an unentangled ground state. This broadens the scope of QET's applicability across diverse quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Feynman's Entangled Paths to Optimized Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We motivate an intuitive way to think about quantum circuit optimization problem inspired by Feynman's path formalism. While the use of path integrals in quantum circuits remains largely underdeveloped due to the lack of definition of the action functional for such systems. However this feynman's path perspective leads us to consider about how entanglement evolution throughout the circuit can serve as a guiding principle for optimizing circuit design. We conjecture that an optimal state-path is highly likely to belong to a family of paths with the minimum possible path-entanglement sum. This could enhance the efficiency of circuit optimization problems by narrowing the state-path search space, leading to faster convergence and reliable output. Further, we discuss that for some special target states this conjecture may not provide significant insights to the circuit optimization problem and argue that such cases constitute only a small subset of the target sets encountered by a circuit optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. We then engineer a fermionic color code which corrects for both phase and loss errors. We show how to realize a universal fermionic gate set in this code, including transversal Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we realize qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for simulating fermions. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates by introducing a neutral-atom braiding gate using photodissociation of bosonic molecules. As an application, we consider the fermionic fast Fourier transform, an important subroutine for simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ and a linear improvement from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ in Clifford gate complexity compared to state-of-the-art qubit-only approaches. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Emerging Non-Hermitian Topology in a Chiral Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain describing coupled lossy photonic modes, in which time-reversal symmetry is broken by a coherent drive with a uniform phase gradient. We investigate this model by means of a Gaussian variational ansatz and numerically prove that the steady-state solution is stabilized by an inhomogeneous profile of the driving amplitude, which damps out boundary effects. Our calculations unveil a non-equilibrium phase diagram showing low- and high-density phases for photons separated by a phase coexistence region in which the system exhibits the phenomenon of topological amplification and is characterized by a finite non-Hermitian winding number. Our work shows the emergence of non-Hermitian topological phases in an interacting model that can be naturally implemented with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Use of Electron Paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to build quantum computers: n-qubit (n=1,2,3,4) Toffoli Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown theoretically how to use the EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) technique, using electron spins as qubits, coupled with each other by the exchange interaction, to set the configuration of n qubits (n=1,2,3,4) at resonance, in conjunction with pulses, to construct the NOT (one qubit), CNOT (two qubits), CCNOT (three qubits), CCCNOT (four qubits) Toffoli gates, which can be exploited to build a quantum computer. This is unique to EPR, wherein exchange-coupled electron spins are used. This is not possible with NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), that uses nuclear spins as qubits, which do not couple with each other by the exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Unexpected consequences of Post-Quantum theories in the graph-theoretical approach to correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the implications of the Exclusivity Principle (EP) in the context of quantum and post-quantum correlations. We first establish a key technical result demonstrating that given the set of correlations for a complementary experiment, the EP restricts the maximum set of correlations for the original experiment to the anti-blocking set. Based on it, we can prove our central result: if all quantum behaviors are accessible in Nature, the EP guarantees that no post-quantum behaviors can be realized. This can be seen as a generalization of the result of [Phys. Rev. A 89, 030101(R)], to a wider range of scenarios. It also provides novel insights into the structure of quantum correlations and their limitations.</description>

      <title>An Implementation of the Finite Element Method in Hybrid Classical/Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents the Quantum Finite Element Method (Q-FEM) developed for use in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, and employs the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) algorithm. The proposed method leverages the classical FEM procedure to perform the unitary decomposition of the stiffness matrix and employs generator functions to design explicit quantum circuits corresponding to the unitaries. Q-FEM keeps the structure of the finite element discretization intact allowing for the use of variable element lengths and material coefficients in FEM discretization. The proposed method is tested on a steady-state heat equation discretized using linear and quadratic shape functions. Numerical verification studies demonstrate that Q-FEM is effective in converging to the correct solution for a variety of problems and model discretizations, including with different element lengths, variable coefficients, and different boundary conditions. The formalism developed herein is general and can be extended to problems with higher dimensions. However, numerical examples also demonstrate that the number of parameters for the variational ansatz scale exponentially with the number of qubits to increase the odds of convergence, and deterioration of system conditioning with problem size results in barren plateaus, and hence convergence difficulties.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonlinear optical susceptibilities in linear polaritonic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Localized states in monitored quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study localized states in a monitored evolution on a finite graph and how they are distinguished from the delocalized states in terms of the transition probabilities and the mean transition times. Monitoring is performed by repeated projective measurements with respect to a single quantum state. Our constructive approach is based on a mapping from a set of energy levels and an eigenvector basis onto the monitored evolution matrix. The eigenvalues of the latter are distributed over the complex unit disk and the corresponding transition probabilities decay quickly in the quantum Zeno regime at frequent measurements. A localized basis favors the return to the initial state, while a delocalized basis favors transitions between different states. This provides a practical criterion to identify localized states by measuring the mean transition time.</description>

      <title>Real-time measurement error mitigation for one-way quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum error mitigation scheme for single-qubit measurement errors, particularly suited for one-way quantum computation. Contrary to well established error mitigation methods for circuit-based quantum computation, that require to run the circuits several times, our method is capable of mitigating measurement errors in real-time, during the processing measurements of the one-way computation. For that, an ancillary qubit register is entangled with the to-be-measured qubit and additionally measured afterwards. By using a voting protocol on all measurement outcomes, occurring measurement errors can be mitigated in real-time while the one-way computation continues. We provide an analytical expression for the probability to detect a measurement error in dependency of the error rate and the number of ancilla qubits. From this, we derive an estimate of the ancilla register size for a given measurement error rate and a required success probability to detect a measurement error. Additionally, we also consider the CNOT gate error in our mitigation method and investigate how this influences the probability to detect a measurement error. Finally, we show in proof-of-principle simulations, also considering a hardware noise model, that our method is capable of reducing the measurement errors significantly in a one-way quantum computation with only a small number of ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>Precision bounds for multiple currents in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.</description>

      <title>Extending Quantum Perceptrons: Rydberg Devices, Multi-Class Classification, and Error Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Neuromorphic Computing (QNC) merges quantum computation with neural computation to create scalable, noise-resilient algorithms for quantum machine learning (QML). At the core of QNC is the quantum perceptron (QP), which leverages the analog dynamics of interacting qubits to enable universal quantum computation. Canonically, a QP features $N$ input qubits and one output qubit, and is used to determine whether an input state belongs to a specific class. Rydberg atoms, with their extended coherence times and scalable spatial configurations, provide an ideal platform for implementing QPs. In this work, we explore the implementation of QPs on Rydberg atom arrays, assessing their performance in tasks such as phase classification between Z2, Z3, Z4 and disordered phases, achieving high accuracy, including in the presence of noise. We also perform multi-class entanglement classification by extending the QP model to include multiple output qubits, achieving 95\% accuracy in distinguishing noisy, high-fidelity states based on separability. Additionally, we discuss the experimental realization of QPs on Rydberg platforms using both single-species and dual-species arrays, and examine the error bounds associated with approximating continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum multi-output Gaussian Processes based Machine Learning for Line Parameter Estimation in Electrical Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) is a powerful modeling method with applications in machine learning for various engineering and non-engineering fields. Despite numerous benefits of modeling using GPs, the computational complexity associated with GPs demanding immense resources make their practical usage highly challenging. In this article, we develop a quantum version of multi-output Gaussian Process (QGP) by implementing a well-known quantum algorithm called HHL, to perform the Kernel matrix inversion within the Gaussian Process. To reduce the large circuit depth of HHL a circuit optimization technique called Approximate Quantum Compiling (AQC) has been implemented. We further showcase the application of QGP for a real-world problem to estimate line parameters of an electrical grid. Using AQC, up to 13-qubit HHL circuit has been implemented for a 32x32 kernel matrix inversion on IBM Quantum hardware for demonstrating QGP based line parameter estimation experimentally. Finally, we compare its performance against noise-less quantum simulators and classical computation results.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) advancements over the past few years have had an unprecedented and revolutionary impact across everyday application areas. Its significance also extends to technical challenges within science and engineering, including the nascent field of quantum computing (QC). The counterintuitive nature and high-dimensional mathematics of QC make it a prime candidate for AI's data-driven learning capabilities, and in fact, many of QC's biggest scaling challenges may ultimately rest on developments in AI. However, bringing leading techniques from AI to QC requires drawing on disparate expertise from arguably two of the most advanced and esoteric areas of computer science. Here we aim to encourage this cross-pollination by reviewing how state-of-the-art AI techniques are already advancing challenges across the hardware and software stack needed to develop useful QC - from device design to applications. We then close by examining its future opportunities and obstacles in this space.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information entropy is regarded as a measure of coherence between the observed system and the environment or between many-body. It is commonly described as the uncertainty and purity of a mixed state of a quantum system. Different from traditional information entropy, we introduce a new perspective, aiming to decompose the quantum state and focus on the total amount of information contained in the components that constitute the legal quantum state itself. Based on $\chi^2$ divergence, we define the posterior information content of quantum pure states. We analytically proved that the upper bound of the posterior information of a 2-qubit system is exactly equal to 2. At the same time, we found that when the number of qubits $n&gt;2$ in the quantum system, the process of calculating the upper bound of the posterior information can always be summarized as a standard semi-definite programming. Combined with numerical experiments, we generalized the previous hypothesis: A composite quantum system composed of $n$-qubits, the upper bound of the posterior information should be equal to $n$.</description>

      <title>Correction of circuit faults in a stacked quantum memory using rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model for a stacked quantum memory made with multi-qubit cells, inspired by multi-level flash cells in classical solid-state drive, and we design quantum error correction codes for this model by generalizing rank-metric codes to the quantum setting. Rank-metric codes are used to correct faulty links in classical communication networks. We propose a quantum generalization of Gabidulin codes, which is one of the most popular family of rank-metric codes, and we design a protocol to correct faults in Clifford circuits applied to a stacked quantum memory based on these codes. We envision potential applications to the optimization of stabilizer states and magic states factories, and to variational quantum algorithms. Further work is needed to make this protocol practical. It requires a hardware platform capable of hosting multi-qubit cells with low crosstalk between cells, a fault-tolerant syndrome extraction circuit for rank-metric codes and an associated efficient decoder.</description>

      <title>Classical Verification of Quantum Learning Advantages with Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical verification of quantum learning allows classical clients to reliably leverage quantum computing advantages by interacting with untrusted quantum servers. Yet, current quantum devices available in practice suffers from a variety of noises and whether existed classical verification protocols carry over to noisy scenarios remains unclear. Here, we propose an efficient classical error rectification algorithm to reconstruct the noise-free results given by the quantum Fourier sampling circuit with practical constant-level noises. In particular, we prove that the error rectification algorithm can restore the heavy Fourier coefficients by using a small number of noisy samples that scales logarithmically with the problem size. We apply this algorithm to the agnostic parity learning task with uniform input marginal and prove that this task can be accomplished in an efficient way on noisy quantum devices with our algorithm. In addition, we prove that a classical client with access to the random example oracle can verify the agnostic parity learning results from the noisy quantum prover in an efficient way, under the condition that the Fourier coefficients are sparse. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of classical verification of quantum learning advantages with noises, which provide a valuable guide for both theoretical studies and practical applications with current noisy intermediate scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Variational Quantum Circuit Training: An Improved Neural Network Approach for Barren Plateau Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining classical optimization with parameterized quantum circuit evaluation, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising algorithms in near-term quantum computing. Similar to neural networks (NNs), VQAs iteratively update circuit parameters to optimize a cost function. However, the training of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) is susceptible to a phenomenon known as barren plateaus (BPs). Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as using neural networks to generate VQC parameters. In this paper, we improve the NN-based BP mitigation approach by refining the neural network architecture and extend its applicability to a more generalized scenario that includes random quantum inputs and VQC structures. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing the convergence speed before and after it is utilized. Furthermore, we give an explanation for the effectiveness of this method by utilizing a loss landscape visualization technique and the expressibility metric of VQC. The smoothness of the loss landscape offers an intuitive insight into the method's utility, while the reduction in expressibility accounts for the enhanced trainability. Our research highlights the universal applicability of the NN-based BP mitigation approach, underscoring its potential to drive progress in the development of VQAs across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>On the structure of higher order quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study higher order quantum maps in the context of a *-autonomous category of affine subspaces. We show that types of higher order maps can be identified with certain Boolean functions that we call type functions. By an extension of this identification, the algebraic structure of Boolean functions is inherited by some sets of quantum objects including higher order maps. Using the M\"obius transform, we assign to each type function a poset whose elements are labelled by subsets of indices of the involved spaces. We then show that the type function corresponds to a comb type if and only if the poset is a chain. We also devise a procedure for decomposition of the poset to a set of basic chains from which the type function is constructed by taking maxima and minima of concatenations of the basic chains in different orders. On the level of higher order maps, maxima and minima correspond to affine mixtures and intersections, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>AMARETTO: Enabling Efficient Quantum Algorithm Emulation on Low-Tier FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers and industries are increasingly drawn to quantum computing for its computational potential. However, validating new quantum algorithms is challenging due to the limitations of current quantum devices. Software simulators are time and memory-consuming, making hardware emulators an attractive alternative. This article introduces AMARETTO (quAntuM ARchitecture EmulaTion TechnOlogy), designed for quantum computing emulation on low-tier Field-Programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), supporting Clifford+T and rotational gate sets. It simplifies and accelerates the verification of quantum algorithms using a Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computer (RISC)-like structure and efficient handling of sparse quantum gates. A dedicated compiler translates OpenQASM 2.0 into RISC-like instructions. AMARETTO is validated against the Qiskit simulators. Our results show successful emulation of sixteen qubits on a AMD Kria KV260 SoM. This approach rivals other works in emulated qubit capacity on a smaller, more affordable FPGA</description>

      <title>Realizing Quantum Kernel Models at Scale with Matrix Product State Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data representation in quantum state space offers an alternative function space for machine learning tasks. However, benchmarking these algorithms at a practical scale has been limited by ineffective simulation methods. We develop a quantum kernel framework using a Matrix Product State (MPS) simulator and employ it to perform a classification task with 165 features and 6400 training data points, well beyond the scale of any prior work. We make use of a circuit ansatz on a linear chain of qubits with increasing interaction distance between qubits. We assess the MPS simulator performance on CPUs and GPUs and, by systematically increasing the qubit interaction distance, we identify a crossover point beyond which the GPU implementation runs faster. We show that quantum kernel model performance improves as the feature dimension and training data increases, which is the first evidence of quantum model performance at scale.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear protocol for high-dimensional quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell measurements, which allow entanglement between uncorrelated distant particles, play a central role in quantum communication. Indeed sharing, measuring and creating entanglement lie at the core of various protocols, such as entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation. While for optical qubit systems a Bell measurement can be implemented using only linear components, the same result is no longer true for high-dimensional states, where one has to consider either ancillary photons or nonlinear processes. Here, inspired by the latter approach, we propose a protocol for high-dimensional quantum teleportation based on nonlinear techniques. Moreover, we discuss the practical implementation of our proposed setup in the case of path-encoded qutrits, where nonlinear effects arise from sum-frequency generation. Finally, we compute the fidelity between quantum states to benchmark the validity of our model under the presence of crosstalk noise. Our approach is deterministic, scalable and does not rely on the use of auxiliary photons, thus paving the way towards the practical implementation of quantum networks based on nonlinear effects.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear squeezing is a property of non-Gaussian states of light with an important application in continuous variable quantum computing. We study the generation of nonlinear squeezing in multimode systems produced by the photon-added coherent state technique. We present a protocol and find a regime in which the nonlinear squeezing appears in two modes simultaneously, even for a weak non-Gaussianity induced by the single-photon addition. We explore the properties of nonlinear squeezing depending on the modal structure of light, as well as the seed and local oscillator profiles, and present an optimal measurement strategy.</description>

      <title>Statistics and Complexity of Wavefunction Spreading in Quantum Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the statistics of the results of a measurement of the spreading operator in the Krylov basis generated by the Hamiltonian of a quantum system starting from a specified initial pure state. We first obtain the probability distribution of the results of measurements of this spreading operator at a certain instant of time, and compute the characteristic function of this distribution. We show that the moments of this characteristic function are related to the so-called generalised spread complexities, and obtain expressions for them in several cases when the Hamiltonian is an element of a Lie algebra. Furthermore, by considering a continuum limit of the Krylov basis, we show that the generalised spread complexities of higher orders have a peak in the time evolution for a random matrix Hamiltonian belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble. We also obtain an upper bound in the change in generalised spread complexity at an arbitrary time in terms of the operator norm of the Hamiltonian and discuss the significance of these results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the distribution in space and time of a single-photon excitation shared by a network of dipole-dipole interacting atoms that are also coupled to a common photonic field mode. Time-averaged distributions reveal partial trapping of the excitation near the initially excited atom. This trapping is associated with resonances of the excitation at crossing points of the photon-dressed energy eigenvalues of the network. The predicted photon-induced many-atom trapped excitation (PIMATE) is sensitive to atomic position disorder which broadens the excitation resonances and transforms them to avoided crossings. PIMATE is shown to allow highly effective and accurate sensing of multi-atom networks and their disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-optical stroboscopic scheme to simulate an open quantum system. By incorporating the tritter, consisting of a group of beam splitters, we find the emergence of spontaneous anti-phase synchronization in the steady state. To better understand the synchronization and entanglement properties within the system, we utilize the relative error measure and find the distribution of logarithmic negativity in parameter space shows similar structures with the results of synchronization measure. Finally, we derive the adjoint master equation corresponding to the system when the synchronization condition is satisfied and explain the existence of oscillations. In addition, we explore the effect of non-Markovianity on synchronization, and we find that it only slows down the time for the system to reach the steady state but does not change the synchronization properties of the steady state. Our work provides a promising scheme for experimental studies focused on synchronization and other nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Accelerated first detection in discrete-time quantum walks using sharp restarts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restart is a common strategy observed in nature that accelerates first-passage processes and has been extensively studied using classical random walks. In the quantum regime, restart in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) has been shown to expedite the quantum hitting times. Here, we study how restarting monitored discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) affects the quantum hitting times. We show that the restarted DTQWs outperform classical random walks in target searches, benefiting from quantum ballistic propagation, a feature shared with their continuous-time counterparts. Moreover, the explicit coin degree of freedom in DTQWs allows them to surpass even CTQWs in target detection without sacrificing any quantum advantage. Additionally, knowledge of the target's parity or position relative to the origin can be leveraged to tailor DTQWs for even faster searches. Our study paves the way for more efficient use of DTQWs in quantum-walk-based search algorithms, simulations and modeling of quantum transport towards targeted sites in complex quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.</description>

      <title>All-optical magnetic imaging with spin defects in van der Waals materials at Angstrom-scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic imaging with ultra-high spatial resolution is crucial to exploring the magnetic textures of emerging quantum materials. We propose a novel magnetic imaging protocol that achieves Angstrom-scale resolution by combining spin defects in van der Waals materials and terahertz scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (THz s-SNOM). Spin defects in the atomic monolayer enable the probe-to-sample distance diving into the Angstrom range where the exchange interactions between the probe and sample spins become predominant. This exchange interaction leads to energy splitting of the probe spin in the order of millielectronvolts, corresponding to THz frequencies. With THz optics and the spin-dependent fluorescence of the probe spin, the interaction energy can be resolved entirely through optical methods. Our proposed all-optical magnetic imaging protocol holds significant promise for investigating magnetic textures in condensed matter physics due to its excellent compatibility and high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>On the distillablity conjecture in matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distillability conjecture of two-copy 4 by 4 Werner states is one of the main open problems in quantum information. We prove two special cases of the conjecture. The first case occurs when two 4 by 4 matrices A, B are both unitarily equivalent to block diagonal matrices with 2 by 2 blocks. The second case occurs when B is unitarily equivalent to either -A or the transpose of -A. Plus, we propose a simplified version of the distillability conjecture when both A and B are matrices with distinct eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Satellite-assisted quantum communication with single photon sources and atomic memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite-based quantum repeaters are a promising means to reach global distances in quantum networking due to the polynomial decrease of optical transmission with distance in free space, in contrast to the exponential decrease in optical fibers. We propose a satellite-based quantum repeater architecture with trapped individual atomic qubits, which can serve both as quantum memories and true single photon sources. This hardware allows for nearly deterministic Bell measurements and exhibits long coherence times without the need for costly cryogenic technology in space. We develop a detailed analytical model of the repeater, which includes the main imperfections of the quantum hardware and the optical link, allowing us to estimate that high-rate and high-fidelity entanglement distribution can be achieved over inter-continental distances. In particular, we find that high fidelity entanglement distribution over thousands of kilometres at a rate of 100 Hz can be achieved with orders of magnitude fewer memory modes than conventional architectures based on optical Bell state measurements.</description>

      <title>Capabilities of object-oriented programming for the construction of quantum-kinetic BBGKY equations of high orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical methods based on the density matrix are powerful tools to describe open quantum systems. However, such methods are complicated and intricate to be used analytically. Here we present an object-oriented framework for constructing the equation of motion of the correlation matrix at a given order in the quantum chain of BBGKY hierarchy used to describe the interaction of many-particle systems. The algorithm of machine derivation of equations includes the implementation of the principles of quantum mechanics and operator algebra. It is based on the description and use of classes in the Python programming environment. Class objects correspond to the elements of the equations that are derived: density matrix, correlation matrix, energy operators, commutator and several operators indexing systems. The program contains a special class that allows one to define a statistical ensemble with an infinite number of subsystems. For all classes, methods implementing the actions of the operator algebra are specified. The number of subsystems of the statistical ensemble for the physical problem and the types of subsystems between which pairwise interactions are possible are specified as an input data. It is shown that this framework allows one to derive the equations of motion of the fourth-order correlation matrix in less than a minute.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing inspired paintings: reinterpreting classical masterpieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces. Besides experimenting with hardware runs and circuit noise, our goal is to reproduce these works as physical oil paintings on wooden panels. With this process, we complete a full circle between classical and quantum techniques and contribute to rethinking Art practice in the era of quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Increasing the secret key rate of satellite-to-ground entanglement-based QKD assisted by adaptive optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future quantum networks will be composed of both terrestrial links for metropolitan and continent-scale connections and space-based links for global coverage and infrastructure resilience. However, the propagation of quantum signals through the atmosphere is severely impacted by the effects of turbulence. This is even more the case for entanglement-based quantum communication protocols requiring two free-space channels to be considered simultaneously. In this work, we assess the advantage of turbulence mitigation by adaptive optics, in particular during daytime link operation, so as to increase the coupling of the received signal into an optical fiber. We show in particular that this improves the performance of entanglement-based quantum key distribution by up to a few hundred bits per second when compared with the uncorrected scenario</description>

      <title>Mpemba effect and super-accelerated thermalization in the damped quantum harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of systems far from equilibrium is often complex and unpredictable, challenging and sometimes overturning the physical intuition derived from equilibrium scenarios. One striking example of this is the Mpemba effect, which implies that non-equilibrium states can sometimes relax more rapidly when they are further from equilibrium. Despite a rich historical background, the precise conditions and mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear. Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating Mpemba-like effects within quantum systems. In this work, we explore a quantum manifestation of the Mpemba effect in a simple and paradigmatic model of open quantum systems: the damped quantum harmonic oscillator, which describes the thermalization process of a bosonic mode in contact with a thermal bath at finite temperature $T$. By means of an exact analytical analysis of the relaxation dynamics, we demonstrate that any initial distribution of populations with a mean excitation number exactly equal to the mean number of quanta in the thermal equilibrium state displays an accelerated relaxation to equilibrium, leading to a pronounced Mpemba effect. In particular, one can find a broad class of far-from-equilibrium distributions that relax to equilibrium faster than any other initial thermal state with a temperature $T'$ arbitrarily close to $T$. Thermalization becomes even faster when the initial out-of-equilibrium population distribution matches the first $r$ moments of the equilibrium distribution. In this scenario, the relaxation rate increases linearly with $r$, resulting in a super-accelerated thermalization process.</description>

      <title>An Improved Bound on Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics using a Cryogenic Radio Frequency Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are strong arguments that quantum mechanics may be nonlinear in its dynamics. A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example. As such, experiments searching for potential nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic sector are important. Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a stream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti's Aspen-M-3 chip) as input to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective measurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal superposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator. Thereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable excess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison between the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical baseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic nonlinearity parameter $|\epsilon| \lessapprox 1.15 \times 10^{-12}$, at a 90.0% confidence level. This is the most stringent limit on nonlinear quantum mechanics thus far and an improvement by nearly a factor of 50 over the previous experimental limit.</description>

      <title>Topological schemes for the electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider different schemes for the electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect introduced in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{108}$, 062218 (2023)], exploring subtleties of the phenomenon to enhance the understanding of its topological nature. In the treated examples, the electric current in a solenoid varies in time, changing its internal magnetic field and producing an external electric field, while a quantum charged particle is in a superposition state inside two Faraday cages in an interferometer. The Faraday cages cancel the electric field at their interiors, such that the particle is always subjected to null electromagnetic fields. We discuss how the AB phase difference depends on the topology of the electric and magnetic fields in spacetime in the different treated situations.</description>

      <title>Automatic Quantum Communication Channel with Interference Detection and Reset Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has revolutionized our understanding of information transmission, leading to the development of quantum communication protocols that promise unprecedented security in data transfer. Quantum teleportation, in particular, has emerged as a cornerstone protocol for quantum communication, operating within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices that characterize current quantum hardware. While significant progress has been made in demonstrating quantum teleportation, maintaining reliable high-fidelity communication in practical, noisy environments remains an unsolved challenge, particularly in addressing real-time interference detection and mitigation.
  Here we show that automated interference detection coupled with a strategic reset protocol significantly enhances the reliability of quantum teleportation under realistic noise conditions. Our system incorporates a novel feedback mechanism that continuously monitors quantum state fidelity and triggers resets when interference is detected, improving both the success rate and robustness of the teleportation process. In 20 experimental trials, our approach achieved an interference detection rate of 65\% and required an average of 3.4 resets per successful teleportation, resulting in a maintained fidelity of 0.92, well above classical limits. This reset mechanism reduced the occurrence of failed transmissions by 40\% compared to non-reset trials, demonstrating its essential role in sustaining high fidelity.
  These findings establish a practical framework for robust quantum communication in noisy environments, advancing the field toward reliable quantum networks suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Noise-adapted Quantum Error Correction for Non-Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of quantum error correction (QEC) for non-Markovian noise. Using the well known Petz recovery map, we first show that conditions for approximate QEC can be easily generalized for the case of non-Markovian noise, in the strong coupling regime where the noise map becomes non-completely-positive at intermediate times. While certain approximate QEC schemes are ineffective against quantum non-Markovian noise, in the sense that the fidelity vanishes in finite time, the Petz map adapted to non-Markovian noise uniquely safeguards the code space even at the maximum noise limit. Focusing on the case of non-Markovian amplitude damping noise, we further show that the non-Markovian Petz map also outperforms the standard, stabilizer-based QEC code. Since implementing such a non-Markovian map poses practical challenges, we also construct a Markovian Petz map that achieves similar performance, with only a slight compromise on the fidelity.</description>

      <title>Letting the tiger out of its cage: bosonic coding without concatenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable cat codes are encodings into a single photonic or phononic mode that offer a promising avenue for hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation. Protecting information in a cat code requires measuring the mode's occupation number modulo two, but this can be relaxed to a linear occupation-number constraint using the alternative two-mode pair-cat encoding. We construct multimode codes with similar linear constraints using any two integer matrices satisfying the homological condition of a quantum rotor code. Just like the pair-cat code, syndrome extraction can be performed in tandem with stabilizing dissipation using current superconducting-circuit designs. The framework includes codes with various finite- or infinite-dimensional codespaces, and codes with finite or infinite Fock-state support. It encompasses two-component cat, pair-cat, dual-rail, two-mode binomial, various bosonic repetition codes, and aspects of chi-squared encodings while also yielding codes from homological products, lattices, generalized coherent states, and algebraic varieties. Among our examples are analogues of repetition codes, the Shor code, and a surface-like code that is not a concatenation of a known cat code with the qubit surface code. Codewords are coherent states projected into a Fock-state subspace defined by an integer matrix, and their overlaps are governed by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to measure the total charge remotely for well-separated anyons; this avoids fusing them together. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalisation of the thermal entropy to complex inverse temperatures, which we call the thermal pseudo-entropy. We show that this quantity represents the pseudo-entropy of the transition matrix between Thermofield Double states at different times. We have studied its properties in various quantum mechanical setups, Schwarzian theory, Random Matrix Theories, and 2D CFTs, including symmetric orbifolds. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the averaged thermal pseudo-entropy and the spectral form factor, which is instrumental in distinguishing chaotic and integrable models. Moreover, we have observed a logarithmic scaling of this quantity in models with a continuous spectrum, with a universal coefficient that is sensitive to the scaling of the density of states near the edge of the spectrum. Lastly, we found the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the thermal pseudo-entropy through the Kramers-Kronig relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling regime of photons and quantum materials inside optical cavities has emerged as a promising environment for manipulating states of matter with light. Here, in turn, we show that photons bear witness to cavity quantum-electrodynamical modifications of the material, leading to profoundly non-classical properties of light passing through the cavity. By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g2(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Computational metaoptics for imaging</title>

Abstract: Metasurfaces -- ultrathin structures composed of subwavelength optical elements -- have revolutionized light manipulation by enabling precise control over electromagnetic waves' amplitude, phase, polarization, and spectral properties. Concurrently, computational imaging leverages algorithms to reconstruct images from optically processed signals, overcoming limitations of traditional imaging systems. This review explores the synergistic integration of metaoptics and computational imaging, "computational metaoptics," which combines the physical wavefront shaping ability of metasurfaces with advanced computational algorithms to enhance imaging performance beyond conventional limits. We discuss how computational metaoptics addresses the inherent limitations of single-layer metasurfaces in achieving multifunctionality without compromising efficiency. By treating metasurfaces as physical preconditioners and co-designing them with reconstruction algorithms through end-to-end (inverse) design, it is possible to jointly optimize the optical hardware and computational software. This holistic approach allows for the automatic discovery of optimal metasurface designs and reconstruction methods that significantly improve imaging capabilities. Advanced applications enabled by computational metaoptics are highlighted, including phase imaging and quantum state measurement, which benefit from the metasurfaces' ability to manipulate complex light fields and the computational algorithms' capacity to reconstruct high-dimensional information. We also examine performance evaluation challenges, emphasizing the need for new metrics that account for the combined optical and computational nature of these systems. Finally, we identify new frontiers in computational metaoptics which point toward a future where computational metaoptics may play a central role in advancing imaging science and technology.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Relative Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{left-right relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of boundary states. We compute the left-right relative entropy for reduced density matrices by tracing over either the right- or left-moving modes, deriving a universal formula for two arbitrary, regularized boundary states in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the left-right relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific boundary state choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the left-right sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and the left-right quantum fidelity. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{\tilde{k}}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero left-right relative entropy between certain boundary states, despite their apparent differences. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{relative entanglement sector}, representing the set of boundary states with zero left-right relative entropy. Our findings suggest a profound connection between the relative entanglement sector and the underlying symmetry properties of the boundary states, offering the relative entanglement sector transforms as NIM-reps of a global symmetry of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Relativistic Quantum Information from Effective Field Theory Approach with Implications to Contextual Meanings of Locality and Quantumness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work \cite{biggs2024comparing}, the effective field theory (EFT) is adopted to consider the quantum decoherence of a near-horizon Unrhu-DeWitt (UDW) charged qubit in a macroscopic cat state. We generalize this EFT approach to study the relativistic quantum information (RQI) of two static UDW-charged qubits with or without a black hole. This EFT is obtained by integrating out a massless mediator field, yielding the direct Coulombic interactions among intrinsic multipole moments of UDW detectors and the induced one on the black hole. The RQI of the quantum state of the mediator field can be probed by the reduced final states of UDW detectors by tracing out the induced internal states of the black hole. From the reduced final state, we find the patterns of entanglement harvesting agree with the ones obtained by the conventional approach based on master theory. However, the more detailed study suggests that the contextual meanings of (non-)locality may or may not be the same in quantum field theory (QFT) and RQI. To explore the contextual meanings of quantumness and locality more, we also calculate quantum discord and locality bound of the Bell-type experiments, with the former characterizing the non-classical correlations and the latter the (non-)locality in the hidden-variable context of RQI. We find that QFT and RQI agree on quantumness based on different physical reasons but may not agree on locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between topology and disorder in the disodered Kitaev model with long range pairing, connected to two metallic leads exchanging particles with external Lindblad baths. We study how the phase diagram of the system is affected by the disorder by monitoring the subgap modes at increasing disorder, by computing the current flowing across the superconductor at a finite voltage bias between the baths, and by looking at the normal, single particle lead correlations across the Kitaev long range chain. In particular, we evidence the reentrant behavior of the massive, topological phase at limited values of the disorder strength, that has no analog in the disordered, short range pairing Kitaev model, thus rising the question of whether it is possible to recover a disorder triggered direct transition between the massive and the short range topological phase of the long range pairing Kitaev model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In holography, two manifestations of the black hole information paradox are given by the non-isometric nature of the bulk-boundary map and by the factorisation puzzle. By considering time-shifted microstates of the eternal black hole, we demonstrate that both these puzzles may be simultaneously resolved by taking into account non-local quantum corrections that correspond to wormholes arising from state averaging. This is achieved by showing, using a resolvent technique, that the resulting Hilbert space for an eternal black hole in Anti-de Sitter space is finite-dimensional with a discrete energy spectrum. The latter gives rise to a transition to a type I von Neumann algebra.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of having relativistic quantum mechanics re-formulated with hydrodynamic variables, and specifically the problem of deriving the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations from the Dirac equation. The problem will be answered on a general manifold with torsion and gravity. We will demonstrate that when plane waves are considered the MPD equations acquire the form given in [1], but we will also see that in such a form the MPD equations become trivial.</description>

      <title>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Particularly, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via the shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that the result matches the one obtained from shockwave analysis. Furthermore, we analyze in detail, the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent (z), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), charge (Q) and the horizon radius ($r_{h}$). We interestingly find non-monotonic behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to z (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of $\theta$, Q and $r_{h}$) and $\theta$ (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of z, Q and $r_{h}$). Moreover, $v_{B}$ is found to monotonically decrease with an increase in charge (for all permissible, fixed values of z, $\theta$ and $r_{h}$), whereas it is found to monotonically increase with $r_{h}$ (for all fixed, permissible values of z, $\theta$ and Q). Unpacking these features can offer some valuable insights into the chaotic nature of HVL theories.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson parametric amplifier array: A proposal for directional, broadband, and low-noise amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-noise microwave amplifiers are crucial for detecting weak signals in fields such as quantum technology and radio astronomy. However, designing an ideal amplifier is challenging, as it must cover a wide frequency range, add minimal noise, and operate directionally - amplifying signals only in the observer's direction while protecting the source from environmental interference. In this work, we demonstrate that an array of non-linearly coupled Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) can collectively function as a directional, broadband quantum amplifier by harnessing topological effects. By applying a collective four-wave-mixing pump with inhomogeneous amplitudes and linearly increasing phase, we break time-reversal symmetry in the JPA array and stabilize a topological amplification regime where signals are exponentially amplified in one direction and exponentially suppressed in the opposite. We show that compact devices with few sites $N\sim 11-17$ can achieve exceptional performance, with gains exceeding 20 dB over a bandwidth ranging from hundreds of MHz to GHz, and reverse isolation suppressing backward noise by more than 30 dB across all frequencies. The device also operates near the quantum noise limit and provides topological protection against up to 15% fabrication disorder, effectively suppressing gain ripples. The amplifier's intrinsic directionality eliminates the need for external isolators, paving the way for fully on-chip, near-ideal superconducting pre-amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Inevitability of knowing less than nothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. Here, we introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and we argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. We then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of our arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Constant-depth circuits for Boolean functions and quantum memory devices using multi-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the power of the unbounded Fan-Out gate and the Global Tunable gates generated by Ising-type Hamiltonians in constructing constant-depth quantum circuits, with particular attention to quantum memory devices. We propose two types of constant-depth constructions for implementing Uniformly Controlled Gates. These gates include the Fan-In gates defined by $|x\rangle|b\rangle\mapsto |x\rangle|b\oplus f(x)\rangle$ for $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ and $b\in\{0,1\}$, where $f$ is a Boolean function. The first of our constructions is based on computing the one-hot encoding of the control register $|x\rangle$, while the second is based on Boolean analysis and exploits different representations of $f$ such as its Fourier expansion. Via these constructions, we obtain constant-depth circuits for the quantum counterparts of read-only and read-write memory devices -- Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) and Quantum Random Access Gate (QRAG) -- of memory size $n$. The implementation based on one-hot encoding requires either $O(n\log^{(d)}{n}\log^{(d+1)}{n})$ ancillae and $O(n\log^{(d)}{n})$ Fan-Out gates or $O(n\log^{(d)}{n})$ ancillae and $16d-10$ Global Tunable gates, where $d$ is any positive integer and $\log^{(d)}{n} = \log\cdots \log{n}$ is the $d$-times iterated logarithm. On the other hand, the implementation based on Boolean analysis requires $8d-6$ Global Tunable gates at the expense of $O(n^{1/(1-2^{-d})})$ ancillae.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Boundaries and Quantum Uncertainty: What Local Observers Can (Not) Predict</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09121v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of quantum theory's salient features is its apparent indeterminism, i.e. measurement outcomes are typically probabilistic. We formally define and address whether this uncertainty is unavoidable or whether post-quantum theories can offer a predictive advantage while conforming to the Born rule on average. We present a no-go claim combining three aspects: predictive advantage, no-signalling, and reliable intersubjectivity between quantum observers. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that there exists a fundamental limitation on genuine predictive advantage. However, we uncover a fascinating possibility: When the assumption of reliable intersubjectivity between different observers is violated, subjective predictive advantage can, in principle, exist. This, in turn, entails an epistemic boundary between different observers of the same theory. The findings reconcile us to quantum uncertainty as an aspect of limits on Nature's predictability.</description>

      <title>Possibilistic and maximal indefinite causal order in the quantum switch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently found that the indefinite causal order in the quantum switch can be certified device-independently when assuming the impossibility of superluminal influences. Here we strengthen this result in two ways. First, we give a proof of this fact which is possibilistic rather than probabilistic, i.e. which does not rely on the validity of probability theory at the hidden variable level. Then, returning to the probabilistic setting, we show that the indefinite causal order in the quantum switch is also maximal, in the sense that the observed correlations are incompatible even with the existence of a causal order on only a small fraction of the runs of the experiment. While the original result makes use of quantum theory's violation of a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, the proofs presented here are based on Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger's and Mermin's proofs of nonlocality, respectively.</description>

      <title>Learning Properties of Quantum States Without the I.I.D. Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for learning properties of quantum states beyond the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input states. We prove that, given any learning problem (under reasonable assumptions), an algorithm designed for i.i.d. input states can be adapted to handle input states of any nature, albeit at the expense of a polynomial increase in training data size (aka sample complexity). Importantly, this polynomial increase in sample complexity can be substantially improved to polylogarithmic if the learning algorithm in question only requires non-adaptive, single-copy measurements. Among other applications, this allows us to generalize the classical shadow framework to the non-i.i.d. setting while only incurring a comparatively small loss in sample efficiency. We use rigorous quantum information theory to prove our main results. In particular, we leverage permutation invariance and randomized single-copy measurements to derive a new quantum de Finetti theorem that mainly addresses measurement outcome statistics and, in turn, scales much more favorably in Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum integer multiplication with zero ancillas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiplication of superpositions of numbers is a core operation in many quantum algorithms. The standard method for multiplication (both classical and quantum) has a runtime quadratic in the size of the inputs. Quantum circuits with asymptotically fewer gates have been developed, but generally exhibit large overheads, especially in the number of ancilla qubits. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for sub-quadratic-time quantum multiplication with zero ancilla qubits -- the only qubits involved are the input and output registers themselves. Our algorithm achieves an asymptotic gate count of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$; with practical choices of parameters, we expect scalings as low as $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.3})$. Used as a subroutine in Shor's algorithm, our technique immediately yields a factoring circuit with $\mathcal{O}(n^{2+\epsilon})$ gates and only $2n + \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits; to our knowledge, this is by far the best qubit count of any factoring circuit with a sub-cubic number of gates. Used in Regev's recent factoring algorithm, the gate count is $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5+\epsilon})$. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithm has the potential to outperform previous proposals at problem sizes relevant in practice, including yielding the smallest circuits we know of for classically-verifiable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Universal energy fluctuations in inelastic scattering processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum scattering is used ubiquitously in both experimental and theoretical physics across a wide range of disciplines, from high-energy physics to mesoscopic physics. In this work, we uncover universal relations for the energy fluctuations of a quantum system scattering inelastically with a particle at arbitrary kinetic energies. In particular, we prove a fluctuation relation describing an asymmetry between energy absorbing and releasing processes which relies on the non-unital nature of the underlying quantum map. This allows us to derive a bound on the average energy exchanged. We find that energy releasing processes are dominant when the kinetic energy of the particle is comparable to the system energies, but are forbidden at very high kinetic energies where well known fluctuation relations are recovered. Our work provides a unified view of energy fluctuations when the source driving the system is not macroscopic but rather an auxiliary quantum particle in a scattering process.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond Exact Solutions on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can be used as a simulator capable of predicting properties of diverse quantum systems. Electronic structure problems in chemistry offer practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. This appears promising since current quantum processors have reached these sizes. However, mapping these use cases onto quantum computers yields deep circuits, and for pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, the large number of measurements to estimate molecular energies leads to prohibitive runtimes. As a result, realistic chemistry is out of reach of current quantum computers in isolation. A natural question is whether classical distributed computation can relieve quantum processors from parsing all but a core, intrinsically quantum component of a chemistry workflow. Here, we incorporate quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6400 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku to assist a quantum computer with a Heron superconducting processor. We simulate the N$_2$ triple bond breaking in a correlation-consistent cc-pVDZ basis set, and the active-space electronic structure of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, using 58, 45 and 77 qubits respectively, with quantum circuits of up to 10570 (3590 2-qubit) quantum gates. We obtain our results using a class of quantum circuits that approximates molecular eigenstates, and a hybrid estimator. The estimator processes quantum samples, produces upper bounds to the ground-state energy and wavefunctions supported on a polynomial number of states. This guarantees an unconditional quality metric for quantum advantage, certifiable by classical computers at polynomial cost. For current error rates, our results show that classical distributed computing coupled to quantum computers can produce good approximate solutions for practical problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Bell Nonlocality from Wigner Negativity in Qudit Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively studied in systems of qubits. For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We show how a bipartite entangled qudit state can serve as a witness for nonlocality when it exhibits Wigner negativity. Additionally, we propose a new generalization of the CHSH inequality for qudits by inquiring correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$-gate. A specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on its Wigner negativity. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we give deterministic Bell violations, as well as violations with a constant number of measurements, for the Bell state relying on operators innate to higher-dimensional systems than the qudit at hand.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Speed-Up for Approximating the Top Eigenvectors of a Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a good approximation of the top eigenvector of a given $d\times d$ matrix $A$ is a basic and important computational problem, with many applications. We give two different quantum algorithms that, given query access to the entries of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and assuming a constant eigenvalue gap, output a classical description of a good approximation of the top eigenvector: one algorithm with time complexity $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(d^{1.75})$ and one with time complexity $d^{1.5+o(1)}$ (the first algorithm has a slightly better dependence on the $\ell_2$-error of the approximating vector than the second, and uses different techniques of independent interest). Both of our quantum algorithms provide a polynomial speed-up over the best-possible classical algorithm, which needs $\Omega(d^2)$ queries to entries of $A$, and hence $\Omega(d^2)$ time. We extend this to a quantum algorithm that outputs a classical description of the subspace spanned by the top-$q$ eigenvectors in time $qd^{1.5+o(1)}$. We also prove a nearly-optimal lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1.5})$ on the quantum query complexity of approximating the top eigenvector.
  Our quantum algorithms run a version of the classical power method that is robust to certain benign kinds of errors, where we implement each matrix-vector multiplication with small and well-behaved error on a quantum computer, in different ways for the two algorithms. Our first algorithm estimates the matrix-vector product one entry at a time, using a new "Gaussian phase estimation" procedure. Our second algorithm uses block-encoding techniques to compute the matrix-vector product as a quantum state, from which we obtain a classical description by a new time-efficient unbiased pure-state tomography procedure.</description>

      <title>Modified Six State Cryptographic Protocol with Entangled Ancilla States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a realistic situation, it is very difficult to communicate securely between two distant parties without introducing any disturbances. These disturbances might occur either due to external noise or may be due to the interference of an eavesdropper sitting in between the sender and the receiver. In this work, we probe here the existence of the possibility of the situation of generation of a secret key even if the eavesdropper is able to construct an entangled ancilla state in such a way that she can extract information from the intercepted qubit. To achieve this task, we consider and modify the six-state QKD protocol in which Eve can construct the unitary transformation that may make all ancilla components entangled at the output. Then, we calculate the mutual information between Alice and Bob and Alice and Eve, and identify the region where the secret key is generated even in the presence of Eve. We find that, in general, the mutual information of Alice and Eve depends not only on the disturbance D, but here we have shown that it also depends on the concurrence of the ancilla component states. We have further shown that it is possible to derive the disturbance-free mutual information of Alice and Eve, if Eve manipulates her entangled ancilla state in a particular manner. Thus, in this way, we are able to show that a secret key can be generated between Alice and Bob even if the disturbance is large enough. Moreover, we show that Bruss's six state QKD protocol failed to generate the secret key in the region where the modified six-state QKD protocol can generate the secret key.</description>

      <title>Complete Positivity and Thermal Relaxation in Quadratic Quantum Master Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of this paper is to develop a systematic method for deriving quantum master equations that satisfy the requirements of a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map, further describing thermal relaxation processes. In this paper, we assume that the quantum master equation is obtained through the canonical quantization of the generalized Brownian motion proposed in our recent paper [T. Koide and F. Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A 494, 129277 (2024)]. At least classically, this dynamics describes the thermal relaxation process regardless of the choice of the system Hamiltonian. The remaining task is to identify the parameters ensuring that the quantum master equation meets complete positivity. We limit our discussion to many-body quadratic Hamiltonians and establish a CPTP criterion for our quantum master equation. This criterion is useful for applying our quantum master equation to models with interaction such as a network model, which has been used to investigate how quantum effects modify heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum learnability from landscape fluctuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conflict between trainability and expressibility is a key challenge in variational quantum computing and quantum machine learning. Resolving this conflict necessitates designing specific quantum neural networks (QNN) tailored for specific problems, which urgently needs a general and efficient method to predict the learnability of QNNs without costly training. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and efficient metric for learnability by comparing the fluctuations of the given training landscape with standard learnable landscapes. This metric shows surprising effectiveness in predicting learnability as it unifies the effects of insufficient expressibility, barren plateaus, bad local minima, and overparametrization. Importantly, it can be estimated efficiently on classical computers via Clifford sampling without actual training on quantum devices. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness regarding physical and random Hamiltonians. We also prove a compact lower bound for the metric in locally scrambled circuits as analytical guidance. Our findings enable efficient predictions of learnability, allowing fast selection of suitable QNN architectures for a given problem without training, which can greatly improve the efficiency especially when access to quantum devices is limited.</description>

Abstract: Our study aims to increase the spatial resolution of high-sensitivity magnetometry based on singlet-transition infrared (IR) absorption using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds in monolithic cavities, with potential applications in bio-magnetic field detection. We develop a master-equation treatment of optically detected magnetic resonance, incorporating IR light saturation effects. This master equation provides the singlet population, which is then utilized to calculate the reflectivity and ultimately derive the magnetic field sensitivity taking into account photon and spin shot noise. We further show that our model is compatible with experiments of IR-based NV center magnetometry. Through optimization in a high-parameter space, we uncover the potential to achieve sensitivities in the order of sub-pico tesla, even for sub-millimeter scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network verification (NWV), broadly defined as the verification of properties of distributed protocols used in network systems, cannot be efficiently solved on classical hardware via brute force. Prior work has developed a variety of methods that scale by observing a structure in the search space and then evaluating classes within the search space instead of individual instances. However, even these classification mechanisms have their limitations. In this paper, we consider a radically different approach: applying quantum computing to more efficiently solve NWV problems. We provide an overview of how to map variants of NWV problems into unstructured search problems that can be solved via quantum computing with quadratic speedup, making the approach feasible in theory to problems that are double in size (of the input). Emerging quantum systems cannot yet tackle problems of practical interest, but rapid advances in hardware and algorithm development make now a great time to start thinking about their application. With this in mind, we explore the limits of scale of the problem for which quantum computing can solve NWV problems as unstructured search.</description>

      <title>Improved phase sensitivity of an SU(1,1) interferometer based on the internal single-path local squeezing operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to passive interferometers, SU(1,1) interferometers exhibit superior phase sensitivity due to the incorporation of nonlinear elements that enhance their ability to detect phase shifts. However, the precision of these interferometers is significantly affected by photon losses, especially internal losses, which can limit the overall measurement accuracy. Addressing these issues is essential to fully realize the advantages of SU(1,1) interferometers in practical applications. Among the known resources of quantum metrology, one of the most practical and efficient is squeezing. We propose a theoretical scheme to improve the precision of phase measurement using homodyne detection by implementing the single-path local squeezing operation (LSO) inside the SU(1,1) interferometer, with the coherent state and the vacuum state as the input states. We not only analyze the effects of the single-path LSO scheme on the phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information (QFI) under both ideal and photon-loss cases but also compare the effects of different squeezing parameters r on the system performance. Our findings reveal that the internal single-path LSO scheme can enhance the phase sensitivity and the QFI, effectively improving the robustness of the SU(1,1) interferometer against internal and external photon losses. Additionally, a larger squeezing parameter r leads to a better performance of the interferometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is an essential ingredient in many quantum communication protocols. In particular, entanglement can be exploited in quantum key distribution (QKD) to generate two correlated random bit strings whose randomness is guaranteed by the nonlocal property of quantum mechanics. Most of QKD protocols tested to date rely on polarization and/or time-bin encoding. Despite compatibility with existing fiber-optic infrastructure and ease of manipulation with standard components, frequency-bin QKD have not yet been fully explored. Here we report the first demonstration of entanglement-based QKD using frequency-bin encoding. We implement the BBM92 protocol using photon pairs generated by two independent, high-finesse, ring resonators on a silicon photonic chip. We perform a passive basis selection scheme and simultaneously record sixteen projective measurements. A key finding is that frequency-bin encoding is sensitive to the random phase noise induced by thermal fluctuations of the environment. To correct for this effect, we developed a real-time adaptive phase rotation of the measurement basis, achieving stable transmission over a 26 km fiber spool with a secure key rate &gt;= 4.5 bit/s. Our work introduces a new degree of freedom for the realization of entangled based QKD protocols in telecom networks.</description>

Abstract: We study critical properties of the entanglement and charge-sharpening measurement-induced phase transitions in a non-unitary quantum circuit evolving with a U(1) conserved charge. Our numerical estimation of the critical properties of the entanglement transition at finite system sizes appears distinct from the generic non-conserving case and percolation. We provide two possible interpretations of this observation: (a) these two transitions occur at different measurement rates in the thermodynamic limit, but at finite system sizes their critical fans overlap and the critical exponents we probed here show a combination of both the criticality. Nonetheless, the multifractal properties of the entanglement transition remain distinct from the generic case without any symmetry, indicating a unique universality class due to the U(1) symmetry. (b) these two transitions occur at the same measurement rate at any length scale. Within this interpretation, our estimation of all the critical exponents are sharply different than the non-conserving case, again confirming the presence of a new universality class due U(1) symmetry. We compute entanglement critical exponents and correlation functions via various ancilla measures, use a transfer matrix for multifractality, and compute correlators associated with charge sharpening to explain these findings. Through these correlators, we also find evidence consistent with the charge-sharpening transition being of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type (including the predicted ``jump'' in stiffness), which simultaneously argues for a broad critical fan for this transition. As a result, attempts to measure critical properties in this finite-size system will see anomalously large exponents predicted by our numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>The Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmon: A Qubit-Based Sensor for meV Scale Phonons and Single THz Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01345v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With great interest from the quantum computing community, an immense amount of R&amp;D effort has been invested into improving superconducting qubits. The technologies developed for the design and fabrication of these qubits can be directly applied to applications for ultra-low threshold particle detectors, e.g. low-mass dark matter and far-IR photon sensing. We propose a novel sensor based on the transmon qubit architecture combined with a signal-enhancing superconducting quasiparticle amplification stage. We refer to these sensors as SQUATs: Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmons. We detail the operating principle and design of this new sensor and predict that with minimal R&amp;D effort, solid-state based detectors patterned with these sensors can achieve sensitivity to single THz photons, and sensitivity to $1\,\mathrm{meV}$ phonons in the detector absorber substrate on the $\mu\mathrm{s}$ timescale.</description>

      <title>Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions exhibit intricate lattice size dependence in their ground state degeneracy (GSD). This and other features such as the position-dependent anyonic excitations are manifestations of UV/IR mixing. In the first part of this paper, we perform an exact calculation of the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) for a specific model, the rank-2 toric code. This analysis includes both contractible and non-contractible boundaries, with the minimum entropy states identified specifically for non-contractible boundaries. Our results show that TEE for a contractible boundary remains independent of lattice size, whereas TEE for non-contractible boundaries, similarly to the GSD, shows intricate lattice-size dependence. In the latter part of the paper we focus on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is an example of a translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, and show that viewing distinct lattice size as a consequence of different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the translation symmetry defect framework as a robust description of the UV/IR mixing in topological lattice models.</description>

      <title>Bound states in the continuum in whispering gallery resonators with pointlike impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whispering gallery resonators offer a versatile platform for manipulating the photonic transmission. Here, we study such a system, including periodically distributed pointlike impurities along the resonator with ring geometry. Based on an exact expression for the transmission probability we obtain here, we demonstrate that the bound states in the continuum (BICs) form from the whispering gallery modes at the high-symmetry momenta in the ring's Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the presence of the inversion symmetry allows for a selective decoupling of resonant states, favoring the BIC generation and, therefore, allowing extra tunability in the optical transmission of the system.</description>

      <title>Emergence of moir\'e superlattice potential in graphene by twisted-hBN layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices formed in stacks of two or more 2D crystals with similar lattice structures have recently become excellent platforms to reveal new physics in low-dimensional systems. They are, however, highly sensitive to the angle and lattice constant differences between the associated crystals, limiting the range of the material choice and the possible moir\'e patterns for a given 2D crystal. Here, we present a novel approach to realize an atomically flat substrate with a periodic moir\'e pattern that can induce the moir\'e potential on the material on top by van der Waals (vdW) interactions, without suffering from the lattice and angle mismatch. By constructing a twisted hBN (thBN) moir\'e substrate at an angle of about 1$^\circ$, we show that the graphene on top, aligned around 15$^\circ$ with the neighboring hBN layers, exhibits typical transport properties under a hexagonal moir\'e potential, including multiple satellite Dirac points (DPs), Hofstadter butterfly effect, and Brown-Zak oscillations. All features point to the existence of the moir\'e potential in graphene formed by thBN with $\sim$1$^\circ$ twist angle. Further statistical study shows that the twist from a parallel interface between the hBN layers is critical to induce the moir\'e potential. Our study demonstrates that the thBN moir\'e substrate can be used to investigate moir\'e physics in arbitrary materials without being constrained by their lattice constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter extends previous findings on the modified Schr\"odinger evolution inspired by quantum gravity phenomenology. By establishing a connection between this approach and fractional quantum mechanics, we provide insights into a potential deep infrared regime of quantum gravity, characterized by the emergence of fractal dimensions, similar to behaviors observed in the deep ultraviolet regime. Additionally, we explore the experimental investigations of this regime using Bose-Einstein condensates. Notably, our analysis reveals a direct implication of this analogy: general experiments probing fractional quantum mechanics may serve as equivalent models of quantum gravity. We identify instances of nonlocal behavior in such systems, suggesting an analogous phenomenon of nonlocality in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect for a $Q$-clock type system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in a working substance corresponding to a square lattice of spins with $Q$ possible orientations, known as the ``$Q$-state clock model". When the $Q$-state clock model has $Q\geq 5$ possible configurations, it presents the famous Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase associated with vortices states. We calculate thermodynamic quantities using Monte Carlo simulations for even $Q$ numbers, ranging from $Q=2$ to $Q=8$ spin orientations per site in a lattice. We use lattices of different sizes with $L\times L = 8^{2}, 16^{2}, 32^{2}, 64^{2}, \text{and}\ 128^{2}$ sites, considering free boundary conditions and an external magnetic field varying between $B = 0$ and $B=1$ in natural units of the system. By obtaining the entropy, it is possible to quantify the MCE through an isothermal process in which the external magnetic field on the spin system is varied. In particular, we find the values of $Q$ that maximize the MCE depending on the lattice size and the magnetic phase transitions linked with the process. Given the broader relevance of the $Q$-state clock model in areas such as percolation theory, neural networks, and biological systems, where multi-state interactions are essential, our study provides a robust framework in applied quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and modeling of $^{171}$Yb Rydberg states for high-fidelity two-qubit gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly excited Rydberg states and their interactions play an important role in quantum computing and simulation. These properties can be predicted accurately for alkali atoms with simple Rydberg level structures. However, an extension of these methods to more complex atoms such as alkaline-earth atoms has not been demonstrated or experimentally validated. Here, we present multichannel quantum defect (MQDT) models for highly excited $^{174}$Yb and $^{171}$Yb Rydberg states with $L \leq 2$. The models are developed using a combination of existing literature data and new, high-precision laser and microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, and validated by detailed comparison with experimentally measured Stark shifts and magnetic moments. We then use these models to compute interaction potentials between two Yb atoms, and find excellent agreement with direct measurements in an optical tweezer array. From the computed interaction potential, we identify an anomalous F\"orster resonance that likely degraded the fidelity of previous entangling gates in $^{171}$Yb using $F=3/2$ Rydberg states. We then identify a more suitable $F=1/2$ state, and achieve a state-of-the-art controlled-Z gate fidelity of $F=0.994(1)$, with the remaining error fully explained by known sources. This work establishes a solid foundation for the continued development of quantum computing, simulation and entanglement-enhanced metrology with Yb neutral atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with $N$ ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition. Besides optimizing the protocol speed, our NOON state preparation scheme achieves excellent fidelities that are competitive for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Two-doublon Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: A quantum-inspired optimization approach is proposed to study the portfolio optimization aimed at selecting an optimal mix of assets based on the risk-return trade-off to achieve the desired goal in investment. By integrating conventional approaches with quantum-inspired methods for penalty coefficient estimation, this approach enables faster and accurate solutions to portfolio optimization which is validated through experiments using a real-world dataset of quarterly financial data spanning over ten-year period. In addition, the proposed preprocessing method of two-stage search further enhances the effectiveness of our approach, showing the ability to improve computational efficiency while maintaining solution accuracy through appropriate setting of parameters. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on quantum-inspired techniques in finance, demonstrating its potential as a useful tool for asset allocation and portfolio management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a precise relation between the rate of complexity of quantum states excited by local operators in two-dimensional conformal field theories and the radial momentum of particles in 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Similar relations have been anticipated based on qualitative models for operator growth. Here, we make this correspondence sharp with two key ingredients: the precise definition of quantum complexity given by the spread complexity of states, and the match of its growth rate to the bulk momentum measured in the proper radial distance coordinate.</description>

      <title>An atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer-based acceleration sensor for microgravity environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of an atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) with a pulsed non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) source as a space-based acceleration sensor. We derive an analytic approximation for the device's transmission under a uniform acceleration, which we use to compute the device's attainable acceleration sensitivity using the classical Fisher information. In the ideal case of a high-finesse FPI and an infinitely narrow momentum width atomic source, we find that when the total length of the device is constrained to small values, the atomic FPI can achieve greater acceleration sensitivity than a Mach-Zender (MZ) interferometer of equivalent total device length. Under the more realistic case of a finite momentum width atomic source, We identify the ideal cavity length that gives the best sensitivity. Although the MZ interferometer now offers enhanced sensitivity within currently-achievable experimental parameter regimes, our analysis demonstrates that the atomic FPI holds potential as a promising alternative in the future, provided that narrow momentum width atomic sources can be engineered.</description>

Abstract: Thouless pumping with nontrivial topological phases provides a powerful means for the manipulation of matter waves in one-dimensional lattice systems. The band topology is revealed by the quantization of pumped charge. In the context of Thouless pumping, we present a graphical representation for the topological phases characterized by the Chern number of an effective two-dimensional band. We illustrate how the two topological phases with distinct Zak phase is connected in the pumping process. Such a visual depiction exhibits typical patterns that is directly related to a linking number and to the Chern number, allowing for the construction of Thouless pumping schemes in a practical way. As a demonstration, we present a generalized Creutz model with tunable Peierls phase, inter-leg imbalance and diagonal hopping. Various modulation schemes for Thouless pumping are studied, focusing on their graphical representations in Bloch space, as well as the quantized pumping phenomenon in real space.</description>
