      <title>A universal reduced basis for the calibration of covariant energy density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced basis method is used to construct a "universal" basis of Dirac orbitals that may be applicable throughout the nuclear chart to calibrate covariant energy density functionals. Relative to our earlier work using the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation, the Dirac equation adds an extra layer of complexity due to the existence of negative energy states. However, once this problem is mitigated, the resulting reduced basis is able to accurately and efficiently reproduce the high-fidelity model at a fraction of the computational cost. We are confident that the resulting reduced basis will serve as a foundational element in developing rapid and accurate emulators. In turn, these emulators will play a critical role in the Bayesian optimization of covariant energy density functionals.</description>

      <title>Towards accurate nuclear mass tables in covariant density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current investigation focuses on detailed analysis of the anchor based optimization approach (ABOA), its comparison with alternative global fitting protocols and on the global analysis of the truncation of basis effects in the calculation of binding energies. It is shown that ABOA provides a solution which is close to that obtained in alternative approaches but at small portion of their computational time. The application of softer correction function after few initial iterations of ABOA stabilizes and speeds up its convergence. For the first time, the numerical errors in the calculation of binding energies related to the truncation of bosonic and fermionic bases have been globally investigated with respect of asymptotic values corresponding to the infinite basis in the framework of covariant density functional theory (CDFT). These errors typically grow up with the increase of the mass and deformation of the nuclei. To reduce such errors in bosonic sector below 10 keV for almost all nuclei with proton number $Z&lt;120$ one should truncate the bosonic basis at $N_B=28$ instead of presently used $N_B=20$. The reduction of the errors in binding energies due to the truncation of the fermionic basis in CDFT is significantly more numerically costly. For the first time it is shown that the pattern and the speed of the convergence of binding energies as a function of the size of fermionic basis given by $N_F$ depend on the type of covariant energy density functional. The use of explicit density dependence of the meson-nucleon coupling constants or point couplings slows down substantially the speed of convergence of binding energies as a function of $N_F$. A new procedure for finding the asymptotic values of binding energies is suggested in the present paper: it allows better control of numerical errors.</description>

      <title>Eikonal calculation of (p,3p) cross sections for neutron-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first, to our knowledge, theoretical description of two-proton removal reactions with proton target $(p,3p)$ for medium-mass nuclei at intermediate energies and present cross sections for the different bound states of the residual nucleus with two fewer protons. The description of the reaction assumes two sequential ``quasifree'' collisions between the target and removed protons and considers eikonal propagation in between. The formalism is applied to the reactions $^{12}\mathrm{C}(p,3p)^{10}\mathrm{Be}$, $^{28}\mathrm{Mg}(p,3p)^{26}\mathrm{Ne}$ and $^{54}\mathrm{Ca}(p,3p)^{52}\mathrm{Ar}$, finding reasonable agreement to experimental data for the $^{12}$C target and an overestimation of a factor $\sim3$ for the more neutron-rich and $^{54}$Ca, which is similar to the results found in two-proton knockout experiments with $^9$Be and $^{12}$C targets.</description>

      <title>Color Glass Condensate meets High Twist Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the correspondence between two well-known frameworks for QCD multiple scattering in nuclear media: the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) and the High-Twist (HT) expansion formalism. We argue that a consistent matching between both frameworks, in their common domain of validity, is achieved by incorporating the sub-eikonal longitudinal momentum phase in the CGC formalism, which mediates the transition between coherent and incoherent scattering. We perform a detailed calculation and analysis of direct photon production in proton-nucleus scattering as a concrete example to establish the matching between HT and CGC up to twist-4, including initial- and final-state interactions, as well as their interferences. The techniques developed in this work can be adapted to other processes in electron-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions, and they provide a potential avenue for a unified picture of dilute-dense dynamics in nuclear media.</description>

      <title>Exploring doubly-heavy tetraquarks in constituent-quark-model based meson-meson coupled-channels approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHCb Collaboration announced in 2021 the discovery of a new tetraquark-like state, named $T_{cc}^+$, with minimum quark content $cc\bar u\bar d$, close to the $D^0D^{*+}$ threshold. This has motivated countless theoretical works trying to identify the dynamics which is responsible of the formation of such state; in particular, the one performed by us in Ref. \cite{Ortega:2022efc}, where a $D^0D^{*+}$ molecular candidate whose mass, width, scattering length and effective ranges are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. We explore herein the possibility of having $T_{cc}^+$ partners in all doubly-heavy tetraquark sectors, considering doubly represented light antiquarks $u$, $d$ or $s$, and taking into account all possible spin-parity quantum numbers. The computation is done using a constituent-quark-model based meson-meson coupled-channels framework which has been tested many times in the last fifteen years describing conventional heavy mesons and baryons, their coupling with hadron-hadron thresholds but also in exploring its application to compact multiquark structures. The advantage of using an approach with such a relatively large history is that it allows us to make predictions because all the parameters have already been constrained from our previous works. Then, from this perspective, we present a parameter-free model-dependent prediction of doubly-heavy tetraquarks that may be partners of the discovered $T_{cc}^+$ state.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal relaxation in Yukawa fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform microscopic many-body simulations of the thermal relaxation of a realistic warm Yukawa fluid by solving the dynamics of an ensemble of N particles in a cubic box acting as a heat reservoir kept at fixed temperature. For specific conditions of density, ion size and potential interaction range we find novel anomalous thermal relaxation for these systems, exhibiting faster cooling from increasingly larger temperature values. Our findings show that the interplay among finite particle size, Yukawa interaction range and density are key to understanding the features of the cooling curve $T(t)$. The non-Newtonian thermal behavior is analyzed in terms of a time-dependent relaxation time $\tau(t)$ and a generalized Langevin equation. We compare our results to existing Mpemba-like phenomena and interpret temperature oscillation patterns arising from a non-trivial memory function. Further, we consider the impact of composition admixtures in the simulated system. We discuss these results and the more general implications for non-Markovian systems where Yukawa-like potentials are involved, such as astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Validating Automated Resonance Evaluation with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrity and precision of nuclear data are crucial for a broad spectrum of applications, from national security and nuclear reactor design to medical diagnostics, where the associated uncertainties can significantly impact outcomes. A substantial portion of uncertainty in nuclear data originates from the subjective biases in the evaluation process, a crucial phase in the nuclear data production pipeline. Recent advancements indicate that automation of certain routines can mitigate these biases, thereby standardizing the evaluation process, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reproducibility. This article contributes to developing a framework for automated evaluation techniques testing, emphasizing automated fitting methods that do not require the user to provide any prior information. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the manual effort needed in the initial evaluation stage. It highlights the capability of the framework to validate and optimize subroutines, targeting the performance analysis and optimization of the fitting procedure using high-fidelity synthetic data (labeled experimental data) and the concept of a fully controlled computational experiment. An error metric is introduced to provide a clear and intuitive measure of the fitting quality by quantifying the accuracy and performance across the specified energy. This metric sets a scale for comparison and optimization of routines or hyperparameter selection, improving the entire evaluation process methodology and increasing reproducibility and objectivity.</description>

      <title>Quasi-fragmentation functions in the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasi-fragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function (FF) where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan (DLY) result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics (QCD2) in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an architecture for neural quantum states for many-body quantum-mechanical systems, based on normalizing flows. The use of normalizing flows enables efficient uncorrelated sampling of configurations from the probability distribution defined by the wavefunction, mitigating a major cost of using neural states in simulation. We demonstrate the use of this architecture for both ground-state preparation (for self-interacting particles in a harmonic trap) and real-time evolution (for one-dimensional tunneling). Finally, we detail a procedure for obtaining rigorous estimates of the systematic error when using neural states to approximate quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Improved description of nuclear charge radii: Global trends beyond $N=28$ shell closure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge radii measured with high accuracy provide a stringent benchmark for characterizing nuclear structure phenomena. In this work, the systematic evolution of charge radii for nuclei with $Z=19$-$29$ is investigated through relativistic mean field theory with effective forces NL3, PK1, and NL3$^{*}$. The neutron-proton ($np$) correlation around Fermi surface originated from the unpaired neutron and proton has been taken into account tentatively in order to reduce the overestimated odd-even staggering of charge radii. This improved method can give an available description of charge radii across $N=28$ shell closure. A remarkable observation is that the charge radii beyond $N=28$ shell closure follow the similarly steep increasing trend, namely irrespective of the number of protons in the nucleus. Especially, the latest results of charge radii for nickel and copper isotopes can be reproduced remarkably well. Along $N=28$ isotonic chain, the sudden increase of charge radii is weakened across $Z=20$, but presented evidently across $Z=28$ closed shell. The abrupt changes of charge radii across $Z=22$ are also shown along $N=32$ and $34$ isotones, but the latter with a less slope. This seems to provide a sensitive indicator to identify the new magicity of a nucleus with universal trend of charge radii.</description>

      <title>Effects of dilute neutron matter on the neutron star crust equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a compressible liquid-drop model to describe the crust of neutron stars for which the role of the nuclear clusters, the neutron gas, and the electrons are clearly identified. The novelty relies on the contribution of the neutron gas, which is qualitatively adjusted to reproduce 'ab initio' predictions in dilute neutron matter. We relate the properties of dilute neutron matter to the ones of neutron stars crust and we compare the mean-field approximation to an improved approach that better describes dilute neutron matter. The latter is quite sensitive to the unitary limit, a universal feature of Fermi systems having a large value of the scattering length and a small interaction range. While the impact of the accurate description of dilute neutron matter is important in uniform matter (up to 30\% corrections with respect to a mean-field calculations), we find a reduction of this impact in the context of the crust of neutron stars due to the additional matter components (nuclear clusters and electrons). In agreement with our previous works, dilute neutron matter is however a necessary ingredient for accurate predictions of the properties of the crust of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We assess the impact of two-particle--two-hole excitations on the semi-inclusive electron scattering process (e,e'p) using a fully relativistic nuclear model calculation that precisely incorporates antisymmetrization. The calculation encompasses all contributions involving the exchange of a single pion and the excitation of a Delta resonance. Our results are compared with (e,e'p) data on carbon at kinematics where two-nucleon emission dominates. This work represents an essential step towards the microscopic computation of the two-particle--two-hole contribution to semi-inclusive neutrino reactions, crucial in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the elliptic flow of deuterons in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon-nucleon pair and show that it can be used to discriminate between direct statistical production and coalescence. The emission from the fireball is parametrized and tuned to reproduce transverse momentum spectra and the elliptic flow of protons and pions. Coalescence leads to higher deuteron elliptic flow than statistical production and agrees better with experimental data. We attribute this observation to the varying size of the nucleon-producing region for the emission in different azimuthal angles.</description>

Abstract: Based on Weizs\"acker-Skyrme (WS4) mass model, the fission barriers of nuclei are systematically studied. Considering the shell corrections, the macroscopic deformation energy and a phenomenological residual correction, the fission barrier heights for nuclei with $Z\geqslant 82$ can be well described, with an rms deviation of 0.481 MeV with respect to 71 empirical barrier heights. In addition to the shell correction at the ground state, the shell correction at the saddle point and its relative value are also important for both deformed nuclei and spherical nuclei. The fission barriers for nuclei far from the $\beta$-stability line and super-heavy nuclei are also predicted with the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to accurately predict the properties of light nuclei and nuclear matter simultaneously in nuclear $ab\ initio$ calculations. In this Letter, we develop the relativistic quantum Monte Carlo methods for the nuclear $ab\ initio$ problem, and calculate the ground-state energies of $A\leq4$ nuclei using the two-nucleon Bonn force with an unprecedented high accuracy. For $A=3,4$ nuclei, the present relativistic results significantly outperforms the nonrelativistic results with only two-nucleon forces. Combining the present results for light nuclei and the previous results for nuclear matter with the same Bonn force, a correlation between the properties of light $A\leq4$ nuclei and the nuclear saturation is revealed, and both systems are well described simultaneously, even without introducing three-nucleon forces. This provides a quantitative understanding of the connection between the light nuclei and nuclear matter saturation properties, which has been an outstanding problem in nuclear $ab\ initio$ calculations for decades.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We illustrate our approach using two examples. The first example is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. We demonstrate an approximately five-fold reduction in the number of two-qubit gates required for computing inner products and Hamiltonian matrix elements. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the Rodeo Algorithm using a specific class of controlled gate networks called controlled reversal gates. Again, a fivefold reduction in the number of two-qubit gates is demonstrated. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems.</description>
