      <title>Dipole Formation in the Two-Component Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional two-component plasma, or Coulomb gas, consisting of $N$ positive and $N$ negative charges with logarithmic interaction. We introduce a suitable regularization of the interaction by smearing the charges over a small length scale $\lambda$, which allows us to give meaning to the system in the continuum at any temperature. We provide an expansion of the free energy in terms of the inverse temperature $\beta$, as $N \to \infty$ and $\lambda \to 0$. Doing so allows us to show that, for $\beta \geq 2$, the charges (for the most part) pair into neutral dipoles of very small size as $\lambda \to 0$. This complements the prior work of Lebl\'e, Zeitouni, and the second author, which proved that this does not happen for $\beta &lt; 2$, thereby implying a transition at $\beta = 2$ from free charges to dipole pairs. Moreover, we obtain an estimate on the size of linear statistics.
  The description in terms of dipoles is made via a decomposition into nearest-neighbor graphs of the point configurations, \`a la Gunson-Panta. This is combined with new energy estimates obtained via an electric reformulation of the interaction energy and a ball-growth method, which are expressed in terms of the nearest-neighbor graph distances only. In this way, the model is compared to a reduced nearest-neighbor interaction model, by showing the relative smallness of the dipole-dipole interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in Ferromagnetic $q-$state Models: Contours, Long-Range Interactions and Decaying Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the group structure of the state space of $q-$state models and a new definition of contour for long-range spin-systems in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with $d\geq 2$, a multidimensional version of Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer contours, we prove the phase transition for a class of ferromagnetic long-range systems which includes the Clock and Potts models. Our arguments work for the entire region of exponents of regular power-law interactions, namely $\alpha &gt; d$, and for any $q \geq 2$. As an application, we prove the phase transition for Potts models with decaying fields when the field decays fast enough.</description>

      <title>The Laplacian with complex magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian when the magnetic field is allowed to be complex-valued. Under the assumption that the imaginary part of the magnetic potential is relatively form-bounded with respect to the real part of the magnetic Laplacian, we introduce the operator as an m-sectorial operator. In two dimensions, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the resolvent is compact. In the case of non-critical complex magnetic fields, a WKB approach is used to construct semiclassical pseudomodes, which do not exist when the magnetic field is real-valued.</description>

      <title>Path Integral for Multiplicative Noise: Generalized Fokker-Planck Equation and Entropy Production Rate in Stochastic Processes With Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive extension of the path integral formalism to model stochastic processes with arbitrary multiplicative noise. To do so, It\^o diffusive process is generalized by incorporating a multiplicative noise term $(\eta(t))$ that affects the diffusive coefficient in the stochastic differential equation. Then, using the Parisi-Sourlas method, we estimate the transition probability between states of a stochastic variable $(X(t))$ based on the cumulant generating function $(\mathcal{K}_{\eta})$ of the noise. A parameter $\gamma\in[0,1]$ is introduced to account for the type of stochastic calculation used and its effect on the Jacobian of the path integral formalism. Next, the Feynman-Kac functional is then employed to derive the Fokker-Planck equation for generalized It\^o diffusive processes, addressing issues with higher-order derivatives and ensuring compatibility with known functionals such as Onsager-Machlup and Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-De Dominicis in the white noise case. The general solution for the Fokker-Planck equation is provided when the stochastic drift is proportional to the diffusive coefficient and $\mathcal{K}_{\eta}$ is scale-invariant. Finally, the Brownian motion ($BM$), the geometric Brownian motion ($GBM$), the Levy $\alpha$-stable flight ($LF(\alpha)$), and the geometric Levy $\alpha$-stable flight ($GLF(\alpha)$) are simulated with thresholds, providing analytical comparisons for the probability density, Shannon entropy, and entropy production rate. It is found that restricted $BM$ and restricted $GBM$ exhibit quasi-steady states since the rate of entropy production never vanishes. It is also worth mentioning that in this work the $GLF(\alpha)$ is defined for the first time in the literature and it is shown that its solution is found without the need for It\^o's lemma.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in \cite{Lv}. Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer.</description>

      <title>Towards eliminating the nonlinear Kelvin wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear disturbance caused by a localised forcing moving at constant speed on the free surface of a liquid of finite depth is investigated using the forced Kadometsev-Petviashvili equation. The presence of a steady v-shaped Kelvin wave pattern downstream of the forcing is established for this model equation, and the wedge angle is characterised as a function of the Froude number. Inspired by this analysis, it is shown that the wake can be eliminated via a careful choice of the forcing distribution and that, significantly, the corresponding nonlinear wave-free solution is stable so that it could potentially be seen in a physical experiment. The stability is demonstrated via the numerical solution of an initial value problem for which the steady wave-free state is attained in the long-time limit.</description>

      <title>Statistical Virtual Temperature of Classical and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a foundational definition of statistical virtual temperature, derived from the spectrum of the Gibbs Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) state and formulated using d-1 indices of purity (IP), where d represents the Hilbert space dimension within the C*-algebra framework. We demonstrate that the universal physical bounds between von Neumann entropy and statistical virtual temperature are constrained by these IPs, which may offer broader applications to quantum systems. Additionally, we geometrize classical optical polarization states of an arbitrary electromagnetic field and provide an interpretation of the quantum Mpemba effect, where a quantum system prepared at a higher statistical virtual temperature relaxes to equilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. This behavior is explained through a novel concept of temperature-resolved entanglement asymmetry. Additionally, we present a geometric interpretation of the third law of thermodynamics using these entropy-temperature diagrams. Nevertheless, the defined statistical virtual temperature inherently exhibits the third law of thermodynamics. We believe that this work has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of classical polarization theory, quantum information theory, and quantum thermodynamics, and it may establish new connections and insights into these fields.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Gauge Theory, Hyperbolic Geometry and Virasoro Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the moduli space of hyperbolic metrics on the disc can be identified with the Virasoro coadjoint orbit $\mathrm{Diff}^+(S^1) / \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. The interest in this relationship has recently been revived in the study of two-dimensional JT gravity and it raises the natural question if all Virasoro orbits $\mathcal{O}$ arise as moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics. In this article, we give an affirmative answer to this question using $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge theory on a cylinder $S$: to any $L\in\mathcal{O}$ we assign a flat $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge field $A_L = (g_L)^{-1} dg_L$, and we explain how the global properties and singularities of the hyperbolic geometry are encoded in the monodromies and winding numbers of $g_L$, and how they depend on the Virasoro orbit. In particular, we show that the somewhat mysterious geometries associated with Virasoro orbits with no constant representative $L$ arise from large gauge transformations acting on standard (constant $L$ ) funnel or cuspidal geometries, shedding some light on their potential physical significance: e.g. they describe new topological sectors of two-dimensional gravity, characterised by twisted boundary conditions. Using a gauge theoretic gluing construction, we also obtain a complete dictionary between Virasoro coadjoint orbits and moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics with specified boundary projective structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there exists a natural analogue of the Yang-Mills equations using the Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket between vector-valued differential forms. The gauge field is a rank-two tensor, and when one constrains it to be symmetric, then the system exhibits fractonic behaviours. In the linearised limit, the constrained equations of motion reduce to those of the covariant fracton model [Bertolini-Maggiore 2022].</description>

      <title>Topological entanglement and number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in the study of topological multi-boundary entanglement in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory (with gauge group $G$ and level $k$) suggest a strong interplay between entanglement measures and number theory. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, we conjecture that the 'sum of the negative powers of the quantum dimensions of all integrable highest weight representations at level $k$' is an integer multiple of the Witten zeta function of $G$ when $k \to \infty$. This provides an alternative way to compute these zeta functions, and we present some examples. Next, we use this conjecture to investigate number-theoretic properties of the R\'enyi entropies of the quantum state associated with the $S^3$ complement of torus links of type $T_{p,p}$. In particular, we show that in the semiclassical limit of $k \to \infty$, these entropies converge to a finite value. This finite value can be written in terms of the Witten zeta functions of the group $G$ evaluated at positive even integers.</description>

      <title>Two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk (SAW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq5$ and use it to prove pattern theorems for the self-avoiding walk. We show that infinite two-sided SAW is the infinite-shift limit of infinite one-sided SAW and the infinite-size limit of finite two-sided SAW. We then prove that for every pattern $\zeta$, the fraction of times $\zeta$ occurs in the SAW converges to the probability that the two-sided infinite SAW starts with $\zeta$. The convergence is in probability for the finite SAW and almost surely for the infinite SAW. Along the way, we show that infinite SAW is ergodic using a coupling technique. At the end of the paper, we pose a conjecture regarding the existence of infinite SAW in low dimensions. We show that this conjecture is true in high dimensions, thus giving a new proof for the existence of infinite SAW for $d\geq5$. The proofs in this paper rely only on the asymptotics for the number of self-avoiding paths and the SAW two-point function. Although these results were shown by Hara and Slade using the lace expansion, the proofs in this paper do not use the lace expansion and might be adapted to prove existence and ergodicity of other infinite high-dimensional lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the half-space KPZ equation with a Neumann boundary condition, starting from stationary Brownian initial data. We derive a variance identity that links the fluctuations of the height function to the transversal fluctuations of a half-space polymer model. Utilizing this identity, we establish optimal fluctuation exponents for the height function in both the subcritical and critical regimes, along with corresponding estimates for the polymer endpoint. Additionally, we explicitly compute the average growth rate as a function of the boundary parameter.</description>

      <title>Conditional entropy and information of quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What would be a reasonable definition of the conditional entropy of bipartite quantum processes, and what novel insight would it provide? We develop this notion using four information-theoretic axioms and define the corresponding quantitative formulas. Our definitions of the conditional entropies of channels are based on the generalized state and channel divergences, such as quantum relative entropy, min- and max-relative entropy, etc. We show that the conditional entropy of quantum channels can potentially reveal important features of the channel, such as its underlying causal structure, which cannot be captured by the entropy of quantum channels or the conditional entropy of bipartite states. Specifically, if the von Neumann conditional entropy $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}$ of a quantum channel $\mathcal{N}_{A'B'\to AB}$ is strictly less than $-\log|A|$, then the channel necessarily has causal influence from $A'$ to $B$. Furthermore, we show that our definition of conditional entropy establishes the strong subadditivity of the entropy for quantum channels. We study the total amount of correlations possible due to quantum processes by defining the multipartite mutual information of quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Integrable Matrix Probabilistic Diffusions and the Matrix Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a matrix version of the stochastic heat equation, the MSHE, and obtain its explicit invariant measure in spatial dimension $D=1$. We show that it is classically integrable in the weak-noise regime, in terms of the matrix extension of the imaginary-time $1D$ nonlinear Schrodinger equation which allows us to study its short-time large deviations through inverse scattering. The MSHE can be viewed as a continuum limit of the matrix log Gamma polymer on the square lattice introduced recently. We also show classical integrability of that discrete model, as well as of other extensions such as of the semi-discrete matrix O'Connell-Yor polymer and the matrix strict-weak polymer. For all these models, we obtain the Lax pairs of their weak-noise regime, as well as the invariant measure, using a fluctuation--dissipation transformation on the dynamical action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice (``Bloch electrons''), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Cyclic stratum of Frobenius manifolds, Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol\alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms, and integral representations of solutions of Quantum Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.08262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of "cyclic stratum" of a Frobenius manifold $M$. This is the set of points of the extended manifold $\mathbb C^*\times M$ at which the unit vector field is a cyclic vector for the isomonodromic system defined by the flatness condition of the extended deformed connection. The study of the geometry of the complement of the cyclic stratum is addressed. We show that at points of the cyclic stratum, the isomonodromic system attached to $M$ can be reduced to a scalar differential equation, called the "master differential equation" of $M$. In the case of Frobenius manifolds coming from Gromov-Witten theory, namely quantum cohomologies of smooth projective varieties, such a construction reproduces the notion of quantum differential equation.
  In the second part of the paper, we introduce two multilinear transforms, called "Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms", on spaces of Ribenboim formal power series with exponents and coefficients in an arbitrary finite dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra $A$. When $A$ is specialized to the cohomology of smooth projective varieties, the integral forms of the Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms are used in order to rephrase the Quantum Lefschetz Theorem. This leads to explicit Mellin-Barnes integral representations of solutions of the quantum differential equations for a wide class of smooth projective varieties, including Fano complete intersections in projective spaces.
  In the third and final part of the paper, as an application, we show how to use the new analytic tools, introduced in the previous parts, in order to study the quantum differential equations of Hirzebruch surfaces. This finally leads to the proof of Dubrovin Conjecture for all Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.04498v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we give a new analytical proof of a theorem of C. Sabbah on integrable deformations of meromorphic connections on $\mathbb P^1$ with coalescing irregular singularities of Poincar\'e rank 1, and generalizing a previous result of B. Malgrange. In the second part of this paper, as an application, we prove that any semisimple formal Frobenius manifold (over $\mathbb C$), with unit and Euler field, is the completion of an analytic pointed germ of a Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold. In other words, any formal power series, which provides a quasi-homogenous solution of WDVV equations and defines a semisimple Frobenius algebra at the origin, is actually convergent under no further tameness assumptions.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff inverse problem for semisimple flat $F$-manifolds, and convergence of oriented associativity potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of classification of quasi-homogeneous formal power series providing solutions of the oriented associativity equations. Such a classification is performed by introducing a system of monodromy local moduli on the space of formal germs of homogeneous semisimple flat $F$-manifolds. This system of local moduli is well-defined on the complement of the "strictly doubly resonant" locus, namely a locus of formal germs of flat $F$-manifolds manifesting both coalescences of canonical coordinates at the origin, and resonances of their "conformal dimensions". It is shown how the solutions of the oriented associativity equations can be reconstructed from the knowledge of the monodromy local moduli via a Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff boundary value problem. Furthermore, standing on results of B.Malgrange and C.Sabbah, it is proved that any formal homogeneous semisimple flat $F$-manifold, which is not strictly doubly resonant, is actually convergent. Our semisimplicity criterion for convergence is also reformulated in terms of solutions of Losev-Manin commutativity equations, growth estimates of correlators of $F$-cohomological field theories, and solutions of open Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations.</description>

      <title>On the universality of integrable deformations of solutions of degenerate Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the classification problem of integrable deformations of solutions of "degenerate" Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff (RHB) problems. These consist of those RHB problems whose initial datum has diagonal pole part with coalescing eigenvalues. On the one hand, according to theorems of B.Malgrange, M.Jimbo, T.Miwa, and K.Ueno, in the non-degenerate case, there exists a universal integrable deformation inducing (via a unique map) all other deformations. On the other hand, in the degenerate case, C.Sabbah proved (arXiv:1711.08514v4), under sharp conditions, the existence of an integrable deformation of solutions, sharing many properties of the one constructed by Malgrange-Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno. Albeit the integrable deformation constructed by Sabbah is not, stricto sensu, universal, we prove that it satisfies a $relative$ universal property. We show the existence and uniqueness of a maximal class of integrable deformations all induced (via a unique map) by Sabbah's integrable deformation. Furthermore, we show that such a class is large enough to include all generic integrable deformations whose pole and deformation parts are locally holomorphically diagonalizable. In itinere, we also obtain a characterization of holomorphic matrix-valued maps which are locally holomorphically Jordanizable. This extends, to the case of several complex variables, already known results independently obtained by Ph.G.A.Thijsse and W.Wasow.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich's star-product up to order 7 for affine Poisson brackets: where are the Riemann zeta values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kontsevich star-product admits a well-defined restriction to the class of affine -- in particular, linear -- Poisson brackets; its graph expansion consists only of Kontsevich's graphs with in-degree $\leqslant 1$ for aerial vertices. We obtain the formula $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with harmonic propagators for the graph weights (over $n\leqslant 7$ aerial vertices); we verify that all these weights satisfy the cyclic weight relations by Shoikhet--Felder--Willwacher, that they match the computations using the $\textsf{kontsevint}$ software by Panzer, and the resulting affine star-product is associative modulo $\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$.
  We discover that the Riemann zeta value $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$, which enters the harmonic graph weights (up to rationals), actually disappears from the analytic formula of $\star_{\text{aff}}\text{ mod }\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ \textit{because} all the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combinations of Kontsevich graphs near $\zeta(3)^2/\pi^6$ represent differential consequences of the Jacobi identity for the affine Poisson bracket, hence their contribution vanishes. We thus derive a ready-to-use shorter formula $\star_{\text{aff}}^{\text{red}}$ mod~$\bar{o}(\hbar^7)$ with only rational coefficients.</description>

      <title>Borel $(\alpha,\beta)$-multitransforms and Quantum Leray-Hirsch: integral representations of solutions of quantum differential equations for $\mathbb P^1$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the integration problem of the isomonodromic system of quantum differential equations ($qDE$s) associated with the quantum cohomology of $\mathbb P^1$-bundles on Fano varieties. It is shown that bases of solutions of the $qDE$ of the total space of the $\mathbb P^1$-bundle can be reconstructed from the datum of bases of solutions of the corresponding $qDE$ associated with the base space. This represents a quantum analog of the classical Leray-Hirsch theorem in the context of the isomonodromic approach to quantum cohomology. The reconstruction procedure of the solutions can be performed in terms of some integral transforms, introduced in arXiv:2005.08262, called $Borel$ $(\alpha,\beta)$-$multitransf\!orms$. We emphasize the emergence, in the explicit integral formulas, of an interesting sequence of special functions (closely related to iterated partial derivatives of the B\"ohmer-Tricomi incomplete Gamma function) as integral kernels. Remarkably, these integral kernels have a universal feature, being independent of the specifically chosen $\mathbb P^1$-bundle. When applied to projective bundles on products of projective spaces, our results give Mellin-Barnes integral representations of solutions of $qDE$s. As an example, we show how to integrate the $qDE$ of blow-up of $\mathbb P^2$ at one point via Borel multitransforms of solutions of the $qDE$ of $\mathbb P^1$.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions of the Koopman--von Neumann Equation on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman--von Neumann equation describes the evolution of a complex-valued wavefunction corresponding to the probability distribution given by an associated classical Liouville equation. Typically, it is defined on the whole Euclidean space. The investigation of bounded domains, particularly in practical scenarios involving quantum-based simulations of dynamical systems, has received little attention so far. We consider the Koopman--von Neumann equation associated with an ordinary differential equation on a bounded domain whose trajectories are contained in the set's closure. Our main results are the construction of a strongly continuous semigroup together with the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the associated initial value problem. To this end, a functional-analytic framework connected to Sobolev spaces is proposed and analyzed. Moreover, the connection of the Koopman--von Neumann framework to transport equations is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Atiyah sequences of braided Lie algebras and their splittings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Associated with an equivariant noncommutative principal bundle we give an Atiyah sequence of braided derivations whose splittings give connections on the bundle. Vertical braided derivations act as infinitesimal gauge transformations on connections. For the $SU(2)$-principal bundle over the sphere $S^{4}_\theta$ an equivariant splitting of the Atiyah sequence recovers the instanton connection. An infinitesimal action of the braided conformal Lie algebra $so_\theta(5,1)$ yields a five parameter family of splittings. On the principal $SO_\theta(2n,\mathbb{R})$-bundle of orthonormal frames over the sphere $S^{2n}_\theta$, the splitting of the sequence leads to the Levi-Civita connection for the `round' metric on the $S^{2n}_\theta$. The corresponding Riemannian geometry of $S^{2n}_\theta$ is worked out.</description>

Abstract: Wave equations for some curved spacetimes may involve functions that prevent a solution in a closed form. In some cases, these functions can be eliminated by transformations and the solutions can be found analytically. In the cases where such transformations are not available, the infinite series expansions of these functions can be convoluted with the power series solution ansatz. We study such an example where the solution is based on a special function.</description>

      <title>A No-Go Theorem of Analytical Mechanics for the Second Law Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We follow the Boltzmann-Clausius-Maxwell (BCM) proposal to solve a long-standing problem of identifying the underlying cause of the second law (SL) of spontaneous irreversibility, a stochastic universal principle, as the mechanical equilibrium (stable or unstable) principle (Mec-EQ-P) of analytical mechanics of an isolated nonequilibrium system of any size. The principle leads to nonnegative system intrinsic (SI) microwork and SI-average macrowork dW during any spontaneous process. In conjuction with the first law, Mec-EQ-P leads to a generalized second law (GSL) dQ=dW&gt;0, where dQ=TdS is the purely stochastic SI-macroheat that corresponds to dS&gt;0 for T&gt;0 and dS&lt;0 for T&lt;0, where T is the temperature. The GSL supercedes the conventional SL formulation that is valid only for a macroscopic system for positive temperatures temperatures, but reformulates it to dS&lt;0 for negative temperatures. It is quite surprising that GSL is not only a direct consequence of intertwined mechanical and stochastic macroquantities through the first law but also remains valid for any arbitrary irreversible process in a system of any size as an identity for positive and negative temperatures. It also becomes a no-go theorem for GSL-violation unless we abandon Mec-EQ-P of analytical mechanics used in the BCM proposal, which will be catastrophic for theoretical physics. In addition, Mec-EQ-P also provides new insights into the roles of spontaneity, nonspontaneity, negative temperatures, instability, and the significance of dS&lt;0 due to nonspontaneity and inserting internal constraints.</description>

Abstract: Pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy are generalizations of the entanglement entropy that involve post-selection. In this work we analyze their properties as measures on the spaces of quantum states and argue that their excess provides useful characterization of a difference between two (i.e. pre-selected and post-selected) states, which shares certain features and in certain cases can be identified as a metric. In particular, when applied to link complement states that are associated to topological links via Chern-Simons theory, these generalized entropies and their excess provide a novel quantification of a difference between corresponding links. We discuss the dependence of such entropy measures on the level of Chern-Simons theory and determine their asymptotic values for certain link states. We find that imaginary part of the pseudo-entropy is sensitive to, and can diagnose chirality of knots. We also consider properties of these entropy measures for simpler quantum mechanical systems, such as generalized SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states, and tripartite GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>On Marginal Stability in Low Temperature Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show marginal stability of near-ground states in spherical spin glasses is equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking at zero temperature near overlap $1$. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, and obtain geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for vector spin glass models. For generic models, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>
