      <title>Brewing Discontent: How U.S. Reciprocal Tariffs on Coffee Could Echo the Boston Tea Party</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research employs quantitative techniques interpreted through relevant economic theories to analyze a proposed U.S. "Discounted Reciprocal Tariff" structure. Statistical modeling (linear regression) quantifies the policy's consistent 'discounted reciprocity' pattern, which is interpreted using a Game Theory perspective on strategic interaction. Machine learning (K-Means clustering) identifies distinct country typologies based on tariff exposure and Economic Complexity Index (ECI), linking the policy to Economic Complexity theory. The study's primary application focuses on the major coffee exporting sector, utilizing simulation modeling grounded in principles of demand elasticity and substitution to project potential trade flow impacts. Specifically, for coffee, this simulation demonstrates how the proposed tariff differentials can induce significant substitution effects, projecting a potential shift in U.S. import demand away from high-tariff origins toward lower-tariff competitors. This disruption, stemming from the tariffs impacting exporting countries, is projected to ultimately increase coffee prices for consumers in the United States. Findings throughout are contextualized within Political Economy considerations. Overall, the study demonstrates how integrating regression, clustering, and simulation with economic theory exemplified through the coffee sector analysis provides a robust framework for assessing the potential systemic impacts, including consumer price effects, of strategic trade policies.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review on Women's Participation in Agricultural Work and Nutritional Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While agriculture is recognised as vital for improving nutrition, the evidence linking women's participation to sustained nutritional gains remains inconclusive. This review synthesizes studies published between 2000 and 2024 to reflect current agricultural practices and nutritional challenges. We examine how agricultural practices and time use affect nutritional outcomes among rural women through pathways such as income generation food preparation and intra-household labour allocation. A structured methodology with clear inclusion and exclusion criteria was used to assess gender-sensitive and nutrition-sensitive interventions. Using narrative synthesis the review categorizes findings around key themes and contextual factors including socio-economic status seasonality and labour intensity. The results show that while increased involvement in agriculture can boost household dietary diversity and income it also raises time burdens that affect food preparation childcare and self-care. Positive outcomes occur when interventions enhance women's decision-making power income access and use of time-saving technologies whereas negative outcomes emerge when excessive workloads compromise energy balance and limit rest. A conceptual framework is presented to map the dual pathways linking agriculture time use and nutrition capturing the roles of labour distribution social norms and resource access. The framework underscores the need to integrate gender equity time efficiency and nutritional objectives into agricultural policies. In conclusion agricultural interventions have potential for nutritional improvement if they are carefully designed to avoid unintended negative impacts on women.</description>

      <title>The building blocks of software work explain coding careers and language popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent waves of technological transformation have fueled debates about the changing nature of work. Yet to understand the future of work, we need to know more about what people actually do in their jobs, going beyond educational credentials or job descriptions. Here we analyze work in the global software industry using tens of millions of Question and Answer posts on Stack Overflow to create a fine-grained taxonomy of software tasks, the elementary building blocks of software development work. These tasks predict salaries and job requirements in real-world job ads. We also observe how individuals learn within tasks and diversify into new tasks. Tasks that people acquire tend to be related to their old ones, but of lower value, suggesting that they are easier. An exception is users of Python, an increasingly popular programming language known for its versatility. Python users enter tasks that tend to be higher-value, providing an explanation for the language's growing popularity based on the tasks Python enables its users to perform. In general, these insights demonstrate the value of task taxonomies extracted at scale from large datasets: they offer high resolution and near real-time descriptions of changing labor markets. In the case of software tasks, they map such changes for jobs at the forefront of a digitizing global economy.</description>

      <title>Meat-Free Day Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions but Poses Challenges for Customer Retention and Adherence to Dietary Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing meat consumption is crucial for achieving global environmental and nutritional targets. Meat-Free Day (MFD) is a widely adopted strategy to address this challenge by encouraging plant-based diets through the removal of animal-based meals. We assessed the environmental, behavioral, and nutritional impacts of MFD by implementing 67 MFDs over 18 months (once a week on a randomly chosen day) across 12 cafeterias on a large university campus, analyzing over 400,000 food purchases. MFD reduced on-campus food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on treated days by 52.9% and contributed to improved fiber (+26.9%) and cholesterol (-4.5%) consumption without altering caloric intake. These nutritional benefits were, however, accompanied by a 27.6% decrease in protein intake and a 34.2% increase in sugar consumption. Moreover, the increase in plant-based meals did not carry over to subsequent days, as evidenced by a 3.5% rebound in animal-based meal consumption on days immediately following treated days. MFD also led to a 16.8% drop in on-campus meal sales on treated days.Monte Carlo simulations suggest that if 8.7% of diners were to eat burgers off-campus on treated days, MFD's GHG savings would be fully negated. As our analysis identifies on-campus customer retention as the main challenge to MFD effectiveness, we recommend combining MFD with customer retention interventions to ensure environmental and nutritional benefits.</description>

      <title>Strategizing with AI: Insights from a Beauty Contest Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A beauty contest is a wide class of games of guessing the most popular strategy among other players. In particular, guessing a fraction of a mean of numbers chosen by all players is a classic behavioral experiment designed to test iterative reasoning patterns among various groups of people. The previous literature reveals that the level of sophistication of the opponents is an important factor affecting the outcome of the game. Smarter decision makers choose strategies that are closer to theoretical Nash equilibrium and demonstrate faster convergence to equilibrium in iterated contests with information revelation. We replicate a series of classic experiments by running virtual experiments with modern large language models (LLMs) who play against various groups of virtual players. We test how advanced the LLMs' behavior is compared to the behavior of human players. We show that LLMs typically take into account the opponents' level of sophistication and adapt by changing the strategy. In various settings, most LLMs (with the exception of Llama) are more sophisticated and play lower numbers compared to human players. Our results suggest that LLMs (except Llama) are rather successful in identifying the underlying strategic environment and adopting the strategies to the changing set of parameters of the game in the same way that human players do. All LLMs still fail to play dominant strategies in a two-player game. Our results contribute to the discussion on the accuracy of modeling human economic agents by artificial intelligence.</description>
