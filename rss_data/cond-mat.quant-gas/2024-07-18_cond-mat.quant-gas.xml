      <title>BCS-BEC crossover of the strongly interacting $^6$Li--$^{40}$K mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the properties of a two--component mass imbalanced Fermi gas, corresponding to the $^6$Li--$^{40}$K mixture. We compute the equation of state of the unpolarized system as a function of the scattering length with particular attention paid to the unitary limit, where the effect of the effective range of the interaction is explored. We have also computed the pair distribution function and the momentum distribution over a range of interaction strengths to provide information about the structure of the system. Finally, we have computed the heavy/light quasiparticle spectrum. Our theoretical predictions, based on Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, can be tested by future experiments with ultracold fermionic gases.</description>

      <title>Effect of strong confinement on the order parameter dynamics in fermionic superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic pairing and the superfluid order parameter change dramatically in low-dimensional systems such as high-T$_c$ superconductors. Here we show how the order parameter dynamics, which defines essential collective properties, is modified by strong confinement. Using a model system for strongly correlated superfluidity, an ultracold fermionic gas, we study the response to a weak modulation of the confinement. Surprisingly, we observe a well-defined collective mode throughout the entire crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of molecules. Starting in the BCS regime, the excitation energy follows twice the pairing gap, then drops below it in the strongly correlated regime, and finally approaches twice the harmonic level spacing imposed by the confinement in the BEC regime. Its spectral weight vanishes when approaching the superfluid critical temperature. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with an effective field theory, providing strong evidence that amplitude oscillations of the order parameter hybridize with and eventually transform into spatial excitations along the confined direction. The strong modification of the excitation spectrum highlights the relevance of confinement to fermionic superfluids and superconductors, and raises questions about its influence on other fundamental quantities.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. For repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments on the triangular lattice supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on explicitly calculated pair interactions for ${}^{87}$Rb and with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian States and How to Measure It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly growing capabilities of quantum simulators to probe quantum many-body phenomena require new methods to characterize increasingly complex states. We present a protocol that constrains quantum states by experimentally measured correlation functions which only scales polynomially with system size. This method enables measurement of a quantum state's entanglement structure, opening a new route to study entanglement-related phenomena. Our approach extends Gaussian state parameterizations by systematically incorporating higher-order correlations. We show the protocol's usefulness in conjunction with current and forthcoming experimental capabilities, focusing on weakly interacting fermions as a proof of concept. Here, the lowest non-trivial expansion quantitatively predicts early time thermalization dynamics, including signaling the on-set of quantum chaos indicated by the entanglement Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping through the Liouvillian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Liouvillian skin effect describes the boundary affinity of Liouvillian eignemodes that originates from the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of the Liouvillian superoperators. Dynamically, it manifests as directional flow in the transient dynamics, and the accumulation of population near open boundaries at long times. Intriguingly, similar dynamic phenomena exist in the well-known process of optical pumping, where the system is driven into a desired state (or a dark-state subspace) through the interplay of dissipation and optical drive. In this work, we show that typical optical pumping processes can indeed be understood in terms of the Liouvillian skin effect. By studying the Liouvillian spectra under different boundary conditions, we reveal that the Liouvillian spectra of the driven-dissipative pumping process sensitively depend on the boundary conditions in the state space, a signature that lies at the origin of the Liouvillian skin effect. Such a connection provides insights and practical means for designing efficient optical-pumping schemes through engineering Liouvillian gaps under the open-boundary condition. Based on these understandings, we show that the efficiency of a typical side-band cooling scheme for trapped ions can be dramatically enhanced by introducing counterintuitive dissipative channels. Our results provide a useful perspective for optical pumping, with interesting implications for state preparation and cooling.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effect in a one-dimensional open many-body quantum system with generalized boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), namely that eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonains are localized at one boundary in the open boundary condition, attracts great interest recently.In this paper, we investigate the skin effect in one-dimensional dissipative quantum many-body systems, which we call the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE). We rigorously identify the existence of LSE for generalized boundary conditions by solving the Liouvillian superoperator of an exactly solvable model with the advantage of Bethe ansatz. The LSE is sensitive to boundary conditions where the signature is reflected in eigenfunctions of the system. We confirm that the LSE is fragile to a tiny co-flow boundary hopping with non-Hermitian current but can survive for a counter-flow boundary hopping in the thermodynamic limit. Our work provides a prototypical example of exactly solvable dissipative quantum many-body lattice systems exhibiting LSE for generalized boundary conditions. It can be further extended to other integrable open quantum many-body models.</description>
