      <title>Space-Time Statistical Solutions of the Incompressible Euler Equations and Landau-Lifshitz Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rigorously the infinite Reynolds limit of the solutions of the Landau-Lifschitz equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for an incompressible fluid on a $d$-dimensional torus for $d\geq 2.$ These equations, which model the effects of thermal fluctuations in fluids, are given a standard physical interpretation as a low-wavenumber ``effective field theory'', rather than as stochastic partial differential equations. We study in particular solutions which enjoy some a priori Besov regularity in space, as expected for initial data chosen from a driven, turbulent steady-state ensemble. The empirical basis for this regularity hypothesis, uniform in Reynolds number, is carefully discussed, including evidence from numerical simulations of turbulent flows that incorporate thermal fluctuations. Considering the initial-value problem for the Landau-Lifschitz equations, our main result is that the infinite Reynolds number limit is a space-time statistical solution of the incompressible Euler equations in the sense of Vishik \&amp; Fursikov. Such solutions are described by a probability measure on space-time velocity fields whose realizations are weak or distributional solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, each with the same prescribed initial data. In conjunction with recent numerical evidence that these probability measures are non-trivial, our theorem shows that the mathematical non-uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for Euler, as revealed by convex integration studies, may be physically realized. In support of the theory of spontaneous stochasticity, any persistent randomness in the infinite-Reynolds limit is associated to a nontrivial probability distribution over non-unique solutions of the ideal Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Twisting vortex lines regularize Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid flows are intrinsically characterized via the topology and dynamics of underlying vortex lines. Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of Mandelbrot cascades -- in the context of vector-valued martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\mathbb{E}[W^t]&lt;\infty$ for all $t&gt;0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\delta}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.
  While the precise Fourier dimension formula seems to be a little magical in the realm of cascade theory, it turns out to be fairly natural in the context of vector-valued martingales. Indeed, the vector-valued martingales will play key roles in our new formalism of actions by multiplicative cascades on finitely additive vector measures, which is the major novelty of this paper.</description>

      <title>ASPINN: An asymptotic strategy for solving singularly perturbed differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations (SPDEs) presents challenges due to the rapid change of their solutions at the boundary layer. In this manuscript, We propose Asymptotic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (ASPINN), a generalization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and General-Kindred Physics-Informed Neural Networks (GKPINN) approaches. This is a decomposition method based on the idea of asymptotic analysis. Compared to PINN, the ASPINN method has a strong fitting ability for solving SPDEs due to the placement of exponential layers at the boundary layer. Unlike GKPINN, ASPINN lessens the number of fully connected layers, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. Moreover, ASPINN theoretically approximates the solution at the boundary layer more accurately, which accuracy is also improved compared to GKPINN. We demonstrate the effect of ASPINN by solving diverse classes of SPDEs, which clearly shows that the ASPINN method is promising in boundary layer problems. Furthermore, we introduce Chebyshev Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Chebyshev-KAN) instead of MLP, achieving better performance in various experiments.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebras via affinization of perm bialgebras and pre-Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the operads of perm algebras and pre-Lie algebras are the Koszul dual each other and hence there is a Lie algebra structure on the tensor product of a perm algebra and a pre-Lie algebra. Conversely, we construct a special perm algebra structure and a special pre-Lie algebra structure on the vector space of Laurent polynomials such that the tensor product with a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra being a Lie algebra structure characterizes the pre-Lie algebra and the perm algebra respectively. This is called the affinization of a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra respectively. Furthermore we extend such correspondences to the context of bialgebras, that is, there is a bialgebra structure for a perm algebra or a pre-Lie algebra which could be characterized by the fact that its affinization by a quadratic pre-Lie algebra or a quadratic perm algebra respectively gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra. In the case of perm algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is called a perm bialgebra, which can be independently characterized by a Manin triple of perm algebras as well as a matched pair of perm algebras. The notion of the perm Yang-Baxter equation is introduced, whose symmetric solutions give rise to perm bialgebras. There is a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the perm Yang-Baxter equation in perm algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras induced from the perm algebras. In the case of pre-Lie algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is a pre-Lie bialgebra which is well-constructed. The similar correspondences for the related structures are given.</description>

      <title>Petrov types, separability and generalized photon surfaces of supergravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum and electrovacuum Einstein equations for spacetimes with two commuting Killing vectors can be solved by indirect methods of integrable systems. But if, in addition, the spacetime admits an irreducible Killing tensor and the corresponding Klein-Gordon equation is separable, they can be integrated directly by separation of variables, as shown by Carter in 1968. We generalize this approach to supergravity and derive a metric ansatz that ensures the above properties for Petrov-type $I$. Our derivation is based on the Benenti-Francavilla ansatz for metrics admitting two commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. We find additional constraints that guarantee the existence of two shear-free null geodesic congruences and the separability of the Klein-Gordon equation. The resulting class of metrics belongs to a certain sector of Petrov type $I$, called $I_B$, whose algebraically special subsector contains only type $D$. For this class, a direct integration of the supergravity equations seems possible. We also show that these spacetimes admit a general description of the generalized photon and massive particle surfaces recently introduced in connection with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal variability and prediction of e-bike battery levels in bike-sharing systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bike Sharing Systems (BSSs) play a crucial role in promoting sustainable urban mobility by facilitating short-range trips and connecting with other transport modes. Traditionally, most BSS fleets have consisted of mechanical bikes (m-bikes), but electric bikes (e-bikes) are being progressively introduced due to their ability to cover longer distances and appeal to a wider range of users. However, the charging requirements of e-bikes often hinder their deployment and optimal functioning. This study examines the spatiotemporal variations in battery levels of Barcelona's BSS, revealing that bikes stationed near the city centre tend to have shorter rest periods and lower average battery levels. Additionally, to improve the management of e-bike fleets, a Markov-chain approach is developed to predict both bike availability and battery levels. This research offers a unique perspective on the dynamics of e-bike battery levels and provides a practical tool to overcome the main operational challenges in their implementation.</description>

      <title>Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Fourier dimension, $\dim_F\mu$, of Mandelbrot multiplicative cascade measures $\mu$ on the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We show that if $\mu$ is the cascade measure generated by a sub-Gaussian random variable then \[\dim_F\mu=\min\{2,\dim_2\mu\}\,,\] where $\dim_2\mu$ is the correlation dimension of $\mu$ and it has an explicit formula.
  For cascades on the circle $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, we obtain \[\dim_F\mu\ge\frac{\dim_2\mu}{2+\dim_2\mu}\,.\]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with general inhomogeneous Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. We propose a new approach to the local well-posedness problem based on conditional regularity estimates. By conditional regularity we mean that any strong solution belonging to a suitable class remains regular as long as its amplitude remains bounded. The result holds for general Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions provided the material derivative of the velocity field vanishes on the boundary of the physical domain. As a corollary of this result we obtain:
  Blow up criteria for strong solutions,
  Local existence of strong solutions in the optimal L^p-L^q framework,
  Alternative proof of the existing results on local well posedness.</description>

      <title>General relativistic Lagrangian continuum theories -- Part I: reduced variational principles and junction conditions for hydrodynamics and elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a Lagrangian variational framework for general relativistic continuum theories that permits the development of the process of Lagrangian reduction by symmetry in the relativistic context. Starting with a continuum version of the Hamilton principle for the relativistic particle, we deduce two classes of reduced variational principles that are associated to either spacetime covariance, which is an axiom of the continuum theory, or material covariance, which is related to particular properties of the system such as isotropy. The covariance hypotheses and the Lagrangian reduction process are efficiently formulated by making explicit the dependence of the theory on given material and spacetime tensor fields that are transported by the world-tube of the continuum via the push-forward and pull-back operations. It is shown that the variational formulation, when augmented with the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary terms, also yields the Israel-Darmois junction conditions between the solution at the interior of the relativistic continua and the solution describing the gravity field produced outside from it. The expression of the first variation of the GHY term with respect to the hypersurface involves some extensions of previous results that we also derive in the paper. We consider in details the application of the variational framework to relativistic fluids and relativistic elasticity. For the latter case, our setting also allows to clarify the relation between formulations of relativistic elasticity based on the relativistic right Cauchy-Green tensor or on the relativistic Cauchy deformation tensor. The setting developed here will be further exploited for modelling purpose in subsequent parts of the paper.</description>

Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions such that the time evolution of a mesoscopic tight-binding open system with a local Hartree-Fock non-linearity converges to a self-consistent non-equilibrium steady state, which is independent of the initial condition from the "small sample". We also show that the steady charge current intensities are given by Landauer-B\"uttiker-like formulas, and make the connection with the case of weakly self-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital Problems using Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the Two-Body and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems in the field of aerospace engineering and sciences is deeply important because they help describe the motion of both celestial and artificial satellites. With the growing demand for satellites and satellite formation flying, fast and efficient control of these systems is becoming ever more important. Global linearization of these systems allows engineers to employ methods of control in order to achieve these desired results. We propose a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of both the Two-Body Problem and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem via deep learning-based Koopman Theory, i.e., a framework that can identify the underlying dynamics and globally linearize it into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The linear Koopman operator is discovered through purely data-driven training of a Deep Neural Network with a custom architecture. This paper displays the ability of the Koopman operator to generalize to various other Two-Body systems without the need for retraining. We also demonstrate the capability of the same architecture to be utilized to accurately learn a Koopman operator that approximates the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem.</description>

      <title>Four dimensional Riemannian general relativity as a spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper $4$ dimensional Riemannian (or Euclidean) vacuum general relativity is recovered from a phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking within a quantum field theory (all in the sense of the operator algebraic approach to quantum field theory) provided by the unique ${\rm II}_1$ hyperfinite factor von Neumann algebra. The formal temperature of this phase transition is $T=\frac{1}{2}T_{\rm Planck}\approx7.06\times 10^{31}{\rm K}$. (For an extended abstract see the text.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey the application of Parisi-Wu's stochastic quantization to the construction of random fields under sublinear expectation framework. In particular, we derive the unique mild solution to the robust Langevin dynamics of bosonic free field -- a parabolic linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by cylindrical $G$-Brownian motions, using the infinite dimensional $G$-Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. Mimicking the linear expectation case, we show the equilibrium distribution of the solution is the sublinear expectation analog of the massive Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Optimal backward uniqueness and polynomial stability of second order equations with unbounded damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For general second order evolution equations, we prove an optimal condition on the degree of unboundedness of the damping, that rules out finite-time extinction. We show that control estimates give energy decay rates that explicitly depend on the degree of unboundedness, and establish a dilation method to turn existing control estimates for one propagator into those for another in the functional calculus. As corollaries, we prove Schr\"odinger observability gives decay for unbounded damping, weak monotonicity in damping, and quantitative unique continuation and optimal propagation for fractional Laplacians. As applications, we establish a variety of novel and explicit energy decay results to systems with unbounded damping, including singular damping, linearised gravity water waves and Euler--Bernoulli plates.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven flows in a non-linear stratified fluid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven flow is a boundary layer flow arising from the interplay of gravity and diffusion in density-stratified fluids when a gravitational field is non-parallel to an impermeable solid boundary. This study investigates diffusion-driven flow within a nonlinearly density-stratified fluid confined between two tilted parallel walls. We introduce an asymptotic expansion inspired by the center manifold theory, where quantities are expanded in terms of derivatives of the cross-sectional averaged stratified scalar (such as salinity or temperature). This technique provides accurate approximations for velocity, density, and pressure fields. Furthermore, we derive an evolution equation describing the cross-sectional averaged stratified scalar. This equation takes the form of the traditional diffusion equation but replaces the constant diffusion coefficient with a positive-definite function dependent on the solution's derivative. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of our approximations. Our investigation of the effective equation reveals that the density profile depends on a non-dimensional parameter denoted as $\gamma$ representing the flow strength. In the large $\gamma$ limit, the system is approximated by a diffusion process with an augmented diffusion coefficient of $1+\cot^{2}\theta$, where $\theta$ signifies the inclination angle of the channel domain. This parameter regime is where diffusion-driven flow exhibits its strongest mixing ability. Conversely, in the small $\gamma$ regime, the density field behaves like pure diffusion with distorted isopycnals. Lastly, we show that the classical thin film equation aligns with the results obtained using the proposed expansion in the small $\gamma$ regime but fails to accurately describe the dynamics of the density field for large $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric polynomials and algebro-combinatorial duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Broadcast Structures from von Neumann type interaction Hamiltonians with continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the mathematical foundations of the recently established theory of Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS). These are multipartite quantum states, encoding an operational notion of objectivity and exhibiting a more advanced form of decoherence. We study SBS and asymptotic convergence to SBS in the case of a central system interacting with N environments via the von Neumann-type measurement interactions, ubiquitous in the theory of open quantum systems. We will be focusing on the case where the system is modeled by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the operators associated with the system in the Hamiltonian have purely continuous spectrum. Such a setup yields mathematical complications that have hitherto not been addressed in the theory of SBS.</description>

      <title>Flat extensions of principal connections and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>
