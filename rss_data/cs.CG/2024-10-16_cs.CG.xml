      <title>Drawing Planar Graphs and 1-Planar Graphs Using Cubic B\'ezier Curves with Bounded Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algorithms for drawing planar graphs and 1-planar graphs using cubic B\'ezier curves with bounded curvature. We show that any n-vertex 1-planar graph has a 1-planar RAC drawing using a single cubic B\'ezier curve per edge, and this drawing can be computed in $O(n)$ time given a combinatorial 1-planar drawing. We also show that any n-vertex planar graph G can be drawn in $O(n)$ time with a single cubic B\'ezier curve per edge, in an $O(n)\times O(n)$ bounding box, such that the edges have ${\Theta}(1/degree(v))$ angular resolution, for each $v \in G$, and $O(\sqrt{n})$ curvature.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal Density-Equalizing Map for Genus-0 Closed Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface parameterization is a fundamental task in geometry processing and plays an important role in many science and engineering applications. In recent years, the density-equalizing map, a shape deformation technique based on the physical principle of density diffusion, has been utilized for the parameterization of simply connected and multiply connected open surfaces. More recently, a spherical density-equalizing mapping method has been developed for the parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces. However, for genus-0 closed surfaces with extreme geometry, using a spherical domain for the parameterization may induce large geometric distortion. In this work, we develop a novel method for computing density-equalizing maps of genus-0 closed surfaces onto an ellipsoidal domain. This allows us to achieve ellipsoidal area-preserving parameterizations and ellipsoidal parameterizations with controlled area change. We further propose an energy minimization approach that combines density-equalizing maps and quasi-conformal maps, which allows us to produce ellipsoidal density-equalizing quasi-conformal maps for achieving a balance between density-equalization and quasi-conformality. Using our proposed methods, we can significantly improve the performance of surface remeshing for genus-0 closed surfaces. Experimental results on a large variety of genus-0 closed surfaces are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Growing Collision-Free Convex Polytopes in Robot Configuration Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two novel algorithms for constructing convex collision-free polytopes in robot configuration space. Finding these polytopes enables the application of stronger motion-planning frameworks such as trajectory optimization with Graphs of Convex Sets [1] and is currently a major roadblock in the adoption of these approaches. In this paper, we build upon IRIS-NP (Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite &amp; Nonlinear Programming) [2] to significantly improve tunability, runtimes, and scaling to complex environments. IRIS-NP uses nonlinear programming paired with uniform random initialization to find configurations on the boundary of the free configuration space. Our key insight is that finding near-by configuration-space obstacles using sampling is inexpensive and greatly accelerates region generation. We propose two algorithms using such samples to either employ nonlinear programming more efficiently (IRIS-NP2 ) or circumvent it altogether using a massively-parallel zero-order optimization strategy (IRIS-ZO). We also propose a termination condition that controls the probability of exceeding a user-specified permissible fraction-in-collision, eliminating a significant source of tuning difficulty in IRIS-NP. We compare performance across eight robot environments, showing that IRIS-ZO achieves an order-of-magnitude speed advantage over IRIS-NP. IRISNP2, also significantly faster than IRIS-NP, builds larger polytopes using fewer hyperplanes, enabling faster downstream computation. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/fastiris</description>

      <title>Measure Theoretic Reeb Graphs and Reeb Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Reeb graph is a graphical representation of a scalar function on a topological space that encodes the topology of the level sets. A Reeb space is a generalization of the Reeb graph to a multiparameter function. In this paper, we propose novel constructions of Reeb graphs and Reeb spaces that incorporate the use of a measure. Specifically, we introduce measure-theoretic Reeb graphs and Reeb spaces when the domain or the range is modeled as a metric measure space (i.e.,~a metric space equipped with a measure). Our main goal is to enhance the robustness of the Reeb graph and Reeb space in representing the topological features of a scalar field while accounting for the distribution of the measure. We first introduce a Reeb graph with local smoothing and prove its stability with respect to the interleaving distance. We then prove the stability of a Reeb graph of a metric measure space with respect to the measure, defined using the distance to a measure or the kernel distance to a measure, respectively.</description>

      <title>Topological reconstruction of sampled surfaces via Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the perception problem for sampled surfaces (possibly with boundary) using tools from computational topology, specifically, how to identify their underlying topology starting from point-cloud samples in space, such as those obtained with 3D scanners. We present a reconstruction algorithm based on a careful topological study of the point sample that allows us to obtain a cellular decomposition of it using a Morse function. No triangulation or local implicit equations are used as intermediate steps, avoiding in this way reconstruction-induced artifices. The algorithm can be run without any prior knowledge of the surface topology, density or regularity of the point-sample. The results consist of a piece-wise decomposition of the given surface as a union of Morse cells (i.e. topological disks), suitable for tasks such as mesh-independent reparametrization or noise-filtering, and a small-rank cellular complex determining the topology of the surface. The algorithm, which we test with several real and synthetic surfaces, can be applied to smooth surfaces with or without boundary, embedded in an ambient space of any dimension.</description>
