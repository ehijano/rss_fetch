      <title>A Multi-line Analysis of the Distribution and Excitation of CS and H$_2$CS in the HD 163296 Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance and distribution of sulfur-bearing molecules in protoplanetary disks directly influences the composition and potential habitability of nascent planets in addition to providing powerful probes of the physical gas conditions in the disks themselves. Here, we present new and archival ALMA and SMA observations of CS and H$_2$CS, and their C$^{34}$S and H$_2$C$^{34}$S isotopologues, at high-angular resolution (${\approx}$0."2-0."4; 20-40 au) in the HD 163296 disk, which reveal a central cavity and multi-ringed emission structure. These observations comprise the most comprehensive, multi-line CS data in a planet-forming disk to date, spanning a wide range of excitation conditions from E$_{\rm{u}}$=7.1 K to 129.3 K, and include new detections of C$^{34}$S, H$_2$CS, and H$_2$C$^{34}$S in this system. Using these data, we derive spatially-resolved rotational temperature and column density profiles for all species. We find a column density ratio N(H$_2$CS)/N(CS) $\approx$ 0.5, which is comparable to that of the similar MWC 480 disk and suggests that organic sulfur compounds may constitute a large fraction of the volatile sulfur reservoir in disks around Herbig stars generally. We derive $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios of ${\approx}$5 (CS/C$^{34}$S) and ${\approx}$2 (H$_2$CS/H$_2$C$^{34}$S) based on disk-averaged and spatially-resolved analyses. Both values are consistent across these two pairs of optically-thin molecules and are well-below the expected ISM ratio of ${\approx}$22, suggesting significant sulfur fractionation. We also constrain the CS emitting layer ($z/r\lesssim 0.1$) using the vertical separations of the disk surfaces in the channel maps and based on the known 2D gas structure of the HD 163296 disk combined with our excitation analysis.</description>

      <title>Limits on the atmospheric metallicity and aerosols of the sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b from high-resolution CRIRES+ spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sub-Neptune planets have no solar system analogues, and their low bulk densities suggest thick atmospheres containing degenerate quantities of volatiles and H/He, surrounding cores of unknown sizes. Measurements of their atmospheric composition can help break these degeneracies, but many previous studies at low spectral resolution have largely been hindered by clouds or hazes, returning muted spectra. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of a short-period sub-Neptune using ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the cores of spectral lines that can extend above potential high altitude aerosol layers. We observe four CRIRES+ $\textit{K}$-band transits of the warm sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b (T$_{\text{eq}}$ = 693$\pm$18 K) which orbits an M2V host star. Despite the high quality data and sensitivity to CH$_4$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$, and H$_2$S, we detect no molecular species. Injection-recovery tests are consistent with two degenerate scenarios. First, GJ 3090 b may host a highly metal-enriched atmosphere with $&gt;\,$150 Z$_{\odot}$ and mean molecular weight $&gt;\,$7.1 g mol$^{-1}$, representing a volatile dominated envelope with a H/He mass fraction $x_{\text{H/He}} &lt; 33\%$, and an unconstrained aerosol layer. Second, the data are consistent with a high altitude cloud or haze layer at pressures $&lt;\,$3.3$\times$10$^{-5}~$bar, for any metallicity. GJ 3090 b joins the growing evidence to suggest that high metallicity atmospheres and high altitude aerosol layers are common within the warm (500$~&lt;T_{\text{eq}}&lt;~$800 K) sub-Neptune population. We discuss the observational challenges posed by the M-dwarf host star, and suggest observing strategies for transmission spectroscopy of challenging targets around M-dwarfs for existing and ELT instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). III. Retrieval of Planetary Masses in Binaries Using the N-body Model with RV and Astrometry Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that secular perturbations in a binary system not only excite high orbital eccentricities but also alter the planetary orbital inclination, the classical Keplerian orbital model is no longer applicable for orbital retrieval. The combination of a dynamical model and observational data is essential for characterizing the configuration and planetary mass in close binaries. We calculate the theoretical radial velocity (RV) signal in the N-body framework and observe a drift in the RV semi-amplitude, which leads to a reduction in the $m$sin$i$ detection threshold by 20 $M_{\oplus}$, with $\sim$ 100% detection probability in the $m_1$sin$i_1$-$a_1$ parameter space. High-precision RV data with an accuracy of 1 m/s can detect such dynamical effects. For four close-in binaries-GJ 86, GJ 3021, HD 196885, and HD 41004, the deviation between the minimum mass derived from the Keplerian and N-body models is found to be $&gt; 0.2 ~ M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. High-precision astrometric data are also necessary to resolve the 3D orbits and true masses exoplanets. We generate astrometric simulation data with accuracies corresponding to Gaia (57.8 $\mu$as) and the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) (1 $\mu$as), respectively. Joint orbit fitting is performed for RV + Gaia and RV + CHES synergy methods. Compared with the fitting results from the astrometry-only model, the synergy models more effectively constrain the range of orbital inclinations. Using simulation data, we derive precise uncertainties for the true planetary mass, which are critical for determining the evolution of planets around binary stars and multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Angular Momentum Phase Function for Rubble Pile Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the energetics of asteroid rubble piles in order to understand what asteroid morphologies should naturally arise from their formation and evolution process. In doing this, a phase diagram is developed that maps out the range of final minimum energy states that a collapsing gravitational aggregate can achieve as a function of total angular momentum and mass distribution. This is developed assuming properties associated with rubble pile asteroids, and can provide insight into the formation and subsequent evolution of contact binaries and orbital binaries in the solar system as an outcome of catastrophic disruptions. The system angular momentum is used as an independent parameter, combined with resulting minimum energy configurations as a simple function of mass morphology of the final system. The configuration of systems with an energy boosted above the minimum energy state are also considered. This paper considers an ideal case, but outlines general results that can be continued for more precise models of distributed granular media modeled using continuum models or using discrete element models.</description>

      <title>Celestial sunflowers -- Survival of rings around small planetary bodies under solar radiation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Rings around giant planets are a common feature of the solar system. Even though solar radiation pressure is known to destabilize rings by exciting the orbital eccentricity of its particles, the Centaur Chariklo (and possibly Chiron), the dwarf planet Haumea, and trans-Neptunian object Quaoar also host rings of solid material. Aims: We explore the dynamical evolution of rings around spherical Chariklo and Haumea analogs, assuming different particle sizes and tilt angles with respect to the planetary orbital plane of the ring. Methods: The ring dynamics were studied using a GPU-based N-body integrator with an 8th-order Hermite scheme for several thousand years, corresponding to 10 solar orbits. The simulations took into account the gravitational effects of the planet and the Sun, radiation pressure, and the shadow cast by the planet. Results: Two families of rings have been identified depending on the ring tilt angle. Slightly tilted rings (&lt;=40 deg) are unstable under a critical particle size. Highly tilted rings (&gt;=50 deg), however, show instability only for a range of particle sizes that spans 1-10 times the critical size. The planetary shadow reduces the critical size by a factor of five and extends the instability region to 0.1-10 times this newly identified critical size. Conclusions: The stabilization of highly inclined rings occurs because the plane of the ring is forced to be perpendicular to the Solar radiation. As a result, the plane of the ring rotates as the planetary bodies revolves: always facing the sun, like a celestial sunflower. Rings which are closely aligned to the orbital plane of the host planet, such as Haumea and Quaoar, presumably consist of particles with a size at least 1-4 um. However, particles in the rings which are highly tilted, like that around Chariklo and Chiron, should consist of particles &lt;=2.5-15 um or &gt;=60-300 um.</description>

      <title>Early solar wind and dynamo magnetic field topology predictions for (16) Psyche and other asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field, assuming it has such relicts that were magnetized after nebula dispersal via one of two distinct pathways: i. an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid and ii. a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. Field topology and orientation may thus reveal key details of the nature and history of (16) Psyche, and our framework is broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.</description>

      <title>Abundances of refractory ions in Beta Pictoris exocomets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta Pic is a young, A5V star, known for harbouring a large number of exocomets, which frequently transit the star and produce absorption signatures. The physical and chemical properties of these exocomets can be probed by the recently introduced curve of growth approach, which enables column densities measurements in exocomets using observations in numerous spectral lines. Using this approach, we present a new study of archival spectra of Beta Pic obtained with the HST, the HARPS spectrograph, and at the Mont John University Observatory, aimed at constraining the abundance of refractory ions in Beta Pic exocomets. 29 individual objects are studied, all observed in FeII lines (used as a reference ion) and at least one other species (Ni II, Ca II, Cr II...). We find that the refractory composition of exocomets is overall stable, especially for singly ionised species, and consistent with solar abundances. This validates the use of the curve of growth approach to study exocometary composition. We also show that some ions, such as Ca II, are significantly depleted compared to solar abundances, allowing us to constrain the ionisation state in Beta Pic exocomets. We find that most refractory elements (Mg, Ni, Fe...) are split in similar fractions between their first and second ionisation states, with the exception of Ca, mostly ionized twice. A strong correlation between the Al III/Fe II ratio and radial velocity is also found, showing that the most redshifted exocomets tend to be more ionised. These results open the way for further modelling, in order to better understand the physical processes that influence the composition and shape of exocometary tails.</description>

      <title>On the road to the radius valley: distinguishing between gas dwarfs and water worlds with young transiting exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of young transiting exoplanets represents a new frontier in our understanding of planet formation and evolution. For the population of observed close-in sub-Neptunes, two proposed formation pathways can reproduce their observed masses and radii at $\sim$Gyr ages: the "gas dwarf" hypothesis and the "water world" hypothesis. We show that a sub-Neptune's size at early ages $\lesssim 100$ Myrs is strongly dependent on the bulk mean molecular weight within its envelope. As a result, gas dwarfs and water worlds should diverge in size at early ages since the mean molecular weight of gas dwarf envelopes is predicted to be smaller than that of water worlds. We construct population models under both scenarios that reproduce Kepler demographics in the age range $\sim1-10$ Gyrs. We find tentative evidence that the gas dwarf model is more consistent with the small population of young exoplanets $&lt; 40$ Myrs from TESS. We show that planet radius is relatively insensitive to planet mass for young, puffy sub-Neptunes, meaning that well-characterised masses are not necessarily required to exploit the effects of mean molecular weight at the population level. We confirm the predicted difference in planet size between the models is also true under mixed-envelope scenarios, in which envelopes consist of mixtures of hydrogen and steam. We highlight that transit surveys of young exoplanets should target the youngest observable stellar clusters to exploit the effects of mean molecular weight.</description>

      <title>AREPO-IDORT: Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport for Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics on an Unstructured Moving Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation is crucial not only for observing astrophysical objects, but also for transporting energy and momentum. However, accurate on-the-fly radiation transport in astrophysical simulations is challenging and computationally expensive. Here we introduce AREPO-IDORT (Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport), a scheme coupled to the explicit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver in the 3D moving-mesh code AREPO. The discrete ordinates scheme means we directly solve for the specific intensities along discrete directions. We solve the time-dependent relativistic radiation transport equation via an implicit Jacobi-like iterative finite-volume solver, which overcomes the small radiation time-steps needed by explicit methods. Compared to commonly-used moment-based methods, e.g. flux-limited diffusion or M1 closure, this scheme has the advantage of correctly capturing the direction of radiation in both optically-thick and thin regions. It is based on the scheme by Jiang 2021 for the adaptive mesh refinement code ATHENA++, but we generalize the scheme to support (1) an unstructured moving-mesh, (2) local time-stepping, and (3) general equations of state. We show various test problems that commonly-used moment-based methods fail to reproduce accurately. To apply the scheme to a real astrophysics problem, we show the first global 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the entire convective envelope of a red supergiant star. (abridged) For this problem, the radiation module only takes less than half of the total computational cost. Our current scheme assumes grey radiation, is first-order accurate in both time and space (abridged). We expect our scheme will enable more accurate multi-scale radiation MHD simulations involving supersonic bulk motions, ranging from planet formation in protoplanetary disks, stars and associated transients, to accretion flows near black holes.</description>

      <title>Making the unmodulated pyramid wavefront sensor smart II. First on-sky demonstration of extreme adaptive optics with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However, this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation, which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough to run the control loop at &gt;2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions. Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on achieving even higher control loop frequencies (&gt;3 kHz), optimizing the calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated counterpart.</description>

      <title>A parameter scan of dark zone maintenance for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets using theoretical and experimental implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining wavefront stability while directly imaging exoplanets over long exposure times is an ongoing problem in the field of high-contrast imaging. Robust and efficient high-order wavefront sensing and control systems are required for maintaining wavefront stability to counteract mechanical and thermal instabilities. Dark zone maintenance (DZM) has been proposed to address quasi-static optical aberrations and maintain high levels of contrast for coronagraphic space telescopes. To further experimentally test this approach for future missions, such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, this paper quantifies the differences between the theoretical closed-loop contrast bounds and DZM performance on the High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes(HiCAT) testbed. The quantification of DZM is achieved by traversing important parameters of the system, specifically the total direct photon rate entering the aperture of the instrument, ranging from $1.85 \times 10^6$ to $1.85 \times 10^8$ photons per second, and the wavefront error drift rate, ranging from $\sigma_{drift}$ = 0.3 - 3 $nm/\sqrt{iteration}$, injected via the deformable mirror actuators. This is tested on the HiCAT testbed by injecting random walk drifts using two Boston Micromachines kilo deformable mirrors (DMs). The parameter scan is run on the HiCAT simulator and the HiCAT testbed where the corresponding results are compared to the model-based theoretical contrast bounds to analyze discrepancies. The results indicate an approximate one and a half order of magnitude difference between the theoretical bounds and testbed results.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter (S)pins the Planet</title>

Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.</description>

      <title>The Way To Circumbinary Planets</title>

Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) are planets that orbit around both stars of a binary system. This chapter traces the history of research on CBPs and provides an overview over the current knowledge about CBPs and their detection methods. After early speculations about CBPs, inspired by binary star systems and popularized by fictional works, their scientific exploration began with the identification of circumbinary dust disks and progressed to the detection and characterization of the current sample of CBPs. The major part of this review presents the detection methods for CBPs: eclipse timing variations from the light-travel-time effect and from dynamical interactions, transits, radial velocities, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing and astrometry. Each of these methods is described with its strengths and limitations and the main characeristics of the CBP systems found by them are outlined. The potential habitability of CBPs is considered, taking into account the unique environmental conditions created by orbiting a stellar binary. The importance of multi-method detection strategies is underscored, and future advancements from upcoming missions like PLATO are anticipated, promising to expand the understanding of these intriguing celestial bodies.</description>
