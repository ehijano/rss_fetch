      <title>Investigation of Genomic Effect of Zirconium Oxide Nanoparticles in Escherichia coli Bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the concerns of the society about the increase of antibiotic resistant infections, many studies and research have been done on nanoparticles and applications of nano-biotechnology. Zirconium Oxide ($\text{ZrO}_{2}$) in which called zirconia, is a white oxide of zirconium metal that its diameter is 20 nm. The colloidal size of these particles is often smaller than bacterial and eukaryotic cells. The main intention of this paper is to investigate the effect of different doses of $\text{ZrO}_{2}$ NPs on the sequences changes for the $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ ($\textit{E. coli}$) genome. At the first step, $\textit{E. coli}$ was cultured in eosin methylene blue agar and brain heart broth (BHB) mediums, respectively. Then, bacteria were treated with $\text{ZrO}_{2}$ NPs at concentrations of 100, 250, and 350 $\mu$g/ml. After treatment, the growth of bacteria was evaluated by utilizing spectrophotometry at 600 nm after incubation times including 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours at 37 $^{\circ}$C. At the second step, the extraction of DNA was performed by using control and treated samples. Then, the changes in the sequence of bacterial genome were investigated using RAPD markers. Finally, NTSYS-PC platform was employed in order to analyze of the results extracted by electrophoresis of products on agarose gel. In this paper, it was observed that $\text{ZrO}_{2}$ NPs can inhibit the growth of bacteria at concentrations of 250 and 350 $\mu$g/ml after 8 hours of treatment. It was also found that the $\text{ZrO}_{2}$ NPs at different concentrations have not changed the genome sequence of $\textit{E. coli}$. Furthermore, it was concluded that the $\text{ZrO}_{2}$ NPs with the concentration of 350 $\mu$g/ml had the highest inhibitory properties without significant changing in the genomic sequence of $\textit{E. coli}$.</description>

      <title>Bioinformatics and Biomedical Informatics with ChatGPT: Year One Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The year 2023 marked a significant surge in the exploration of applying large language model (LLM) chatbots, notably ChatGPT, across various disciplines. We surveyed the applications of ChatGPT in various sectors of bioinformatics and biomedical informatics throughout the year, covering omics, genetics, biomedical text mining, drug discovery, biomedical image understanding, bioinformatics programming, and bioinformatics education. Our survey delineates the current strengths and limitations of this chatbot in bioinformatics and offers insights into potential avenues for future development.</description>

      <title>Physics-based signal analysis of genome sequences: GenomeBits overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive overview of the recent physics-inspired genome analysis tool, GenomeBits, is presented. This is based on traditional signal processing methods such as Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). GenomeBits can be used to extract underlying genomics features from the distribution of nucleotides, and can be further used to analyze the mutation patterns in viral genomes. Examples of the main GenomeBits findings outlining the intrinsic signal organization of genomics sequences for different SARS-CoV-2 variants along the pandemic years 2020-2022 and Monkeypox cases in 2021 are presented to show the usefulness of GenomeBits. GenomeBits results for DFT of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in different geographical regions are discussed together with the GenomeBits analysis of complete genome sequences for the first coronavirus variants reported: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon and Eta. Interesting features of the Delta and Omicron variants in the form of a unique "order-disorder" transition are uncovered from these samples as well as from their cumulative distribution function and scatter plots. This class of transitions might reveal the cumulative outcome of mutations on the spike protein. A salient feature of GenomeBits is the mapping of the nucleotide bases (A,T,C,G) into an alternating spin-like numerical sequence via a series having binary (0,1) indicators for each A,T,C,G. This leads to derive a set of statistical distribution curves. Furthermore, the quantum-based extension of the GenomeBits model to an analogous probability measure is shown to identify properties of genome sequences as wavefunctions via a superposition of states. An association of the integral of the GenomeBits coding and a binding-like energy can in principle also be established. The relevance of these different results in Bioinformatics is analyzed.</description>
