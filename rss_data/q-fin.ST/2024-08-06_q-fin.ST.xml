      <title>NeuralFactors: A Novel Factor Learning Approach to Generative Modeling of Equities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning for statistical modeling (and thus, generative modeling) has grown in popularity with the proliferation of time series models, text-to-image models, and especially large language models. Fundamentally, the goal of classical factor modeling is statistical modeling of stock returns, and in this work, we explore using deep generative modeling to enhance classical factor models. Prior work has explored the use of deep generative models in order to model hundreds of stocks, leading to accurate risk forecasting and alpha portfolio construction; however, that specific model does not allow for easy factor modeling interpretation in that the factor exposures cannot be deduced. In this work, we introduce NeuralFactors, a novel machine-learning based approach to factor analysis where a neural network outputs factor exposures and factor returns, trained using the same methodology as variational autoencoders. We show that this model outperforms prior approaches both in terms of log-likelihood performance and computational efficiency. Further, we show that this method is competitive to prior work in generating realistic synthetic data, covariance estimation, risk analysis (e.g., value at risk, or VaR, of portfolios), and portfolio optimization. Finally, due to the connection to classical factor analysis, we analyze how the factors our model learns cluster together and show that the factor exposures could be used for embedding stocks.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Relative Valuation of Municipal Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trading ecosystem of the Municipal (muni) bond is complex and unique. With nearly 2\% of securities from over a million securities outstanding trading daily, determining the value or relative value of a bond among its peers is challenging. Traditionally, relative value calculation has been done using rule-based or heuristics-driven approaches, which may introduce human biases and often fail to account for complex relationships between the bond characteristics. We propose a data-driven model to develop a supervised similarity framework for the muni bond market based on CatBoost algorithm. This algorithm learns from a large-scale dataset to identify bonds that are similar to each other based on their risk profiles. This allows us to evaluate the price of a muni bond relative to a cohort of bonds with a similar risk profile. We propose and deploy a back-testing methodology to compare various benchmarks and the proposed methods and show that the similarity-based method outperforms both rule-based and heuristic-based methods.</description>

      <title>Quantile Regression using Random Forest Proximities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of financial markets, maintaining models that produce precise predictions over time is difficult. Often the goal isn't just point prediction but determining uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty, especially the aleatoric uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of market drivers, helps investors understand varying risk levels. Recently, quantile regression forests (QRF) have emerged as a promising solution: Unlike most basic quantile regression methods that need separate models for each quantile, quantile regression forests estimate the entire conditional distribution of the target variable with a single model, while retaining all the salient features of a typical random forest. We introduce a novel approach to compute quantile regressions from random forests that leverages the proximity (i.e., distance metric) learned by the model and infers the conditional distribution of the target variable. We evaluate the proposed methodology using publicly available datasets and then apply it towards the problem of forecasting the average daily volume of corporate bonds. We show that using quantile regression using Random Forest proximities demonstrates superior performance in approximating conditional target distributions and prediction intervals to the original version of QRF. We also demonstrate that the proposed framework is significantly more computationally efficient than traditional approaches to quantile regressions.</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach to Reveal Algorithmic Unfairness in Credit Approval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework, "peer-induced fairness", to scientifically audit algorithmic fairness. It addresses a critical but often overlooked issue: distinguishing between adverse outcomes due to algorithmic discrimination and those resulting from individuals' insufficient capabilities. By utilizing counterfactual fairness and advanced causal inference techniques, such as the Single World Intervention Graph, this model-agnostic approach evaluates fairness at the individual level through peer comparisons and hypothesis testing. It also tackles challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, offering a flexible, plug-and-play self-audit tool for stakeholders and an external audit tool for regulators, while providing explainable feedback for those affected by unfavorable decisions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Elastic String Models of Forward Interest Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twenty five years ago, several authors proposed to describe the forward interest rate curve (FRC) as an elastic string along which idiosyncratic shocks propagate, accounting for the peculiar structure of the return correlation across different maturities. In this paper, we revisit the specific "stiff'' elastic string field theory of Baaquie and Bouchaud (2004) in a way that makes its micro-foundation more transparent. Our model can be interpreted as capturing the effect of market forces that set the rates of nearby tenors in a self-referential fashion. The model is parsimonious and accurately reproduces the whole correlation structure of the FRC over the time period 1994-2023, with an error around 1% and with only one adjustable parameter, the value of which being very stable across the last three decades. The dependence of correlation on time resolution (also called the Epps effect) is also faithfully reproduced within the model and leads to a cross-tenor information propagation time on the order of 30 minutes. Finally, we confirm that the perceived time in interest rate markets is a strongly sub-linear function of real time, as surmised by Baaquie and Bouchaud (2004). In fact, our results are fully compatible with hyperbolic discounting, in line with the recent behavioral Finance literature (Farmer and Geanakoplos, 2009).</description>
