      <title>Spectral conditions for graphs to contain $k$-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. The spectral radius $\rho(G)$ of $G$ is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. For an integer $k\geq1$, a $k$-factor of $G$ is a $k$-regular spanning subgraph of $G$. Assume that $k$ and $n$ are integers satisfying $k\geq2,kn\equiv0~(\mod2)$ and $n\geq\max\left\{k^{2}+6k+7,20k+10\right\}$. Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ and with minimum degree at least $k$. In this paper, we give a sharp lower bound of $\rho(G)$ to guarantee that $G$ contains a $k$-factor.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity for generalized binomial coefficients and Jack positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binomial formulas for Schur polynomials and Jack polynomials were studied by Lascoux in 1978, and Kaneko, Okounkov--Olshanski and Lassalle in the 1990s. We prove that the associated binomial coefficients are monotone and derive some symmetric function inequalities, in particular, a Schur positivity and Jack positivity result. These inequalities are similar to those studied by Newton, Muirhead, Gantmacher, Cuttler--Greene--Skandera, Sra and Khare--Tao.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Spread of Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a directed graph $G$, the spread of $G$ is the largest distance between any two eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. In 2022, Breen, Riasanovsky, Tait, and Urschel asked what $n$-vertex directed graph maximizes spread, and whether this graph is undirected. We prove the more general result that the spread of any $n \times n$ non-negative matrix $A$ with $\|A\|_{\max} \le 1$ is at most $2n/\sqrt{3}$, which is tight up to an additive factor and exact when $n$ is a multiple of three. Furthermore, our results show that the matrix with maximum spread is always symmetric.</description>

      <title>The gonality of circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gonality of a graph measures how difficult it is to move chips around the entirety of a graph according to certain chip-firing rules without introducing debt. In this paper we study the gonality of circulant graphs, a class of vertex-transitive graphs that can be specified by their number of vertices together with a list of cyclic adjacency relations satisfied by all vertices. We provide a universal upper bound on the gonality of all circulant graphs with a fixed adjacency list, which holds irrespective of the number of vertices. We use this upper bound together with computational methods to determine that the gonality of the \(4\)-regular Harary graph on \(n\) vertices is \(10\) for \(n\geq 16\). As a special case, this gives the gonality of sufficiently large antiprism graphs to be \(10\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the strong metric dimension of the complement of the zero-divisor graph of the blow-up of a Boolean lattice. Using these results, we calculate the strong metric dimension of the total graph, the maximal graph, the intersection graph of ideals, the complement of the zero-divisor graph of a reduced ring, and the component graph of a vector space.</description>

      <title>Averages of hypergraphs and higher arity stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $k$-ary functions giving the measure of the intersection of multi-parametric families of sets in probability spaces, e.g. $(x,y,z) \in X \times Y \times Z \mapsto \mu(P_{x,y} \cap Q_{x,z} \cap R_{y,z})$, satisfy a particularly strong form of hypergraph regularity. More generally, this applies to the (integral) averages of continuous combinations of functions of smaller arity. This result is connected to higher arity stability in model theory, that we discuss in the second part of the paper. We demonstrate that all hypergraphs embedding both into the half-simplex and into $GS(\mathbb{F}_3)$, the two known sources of failure of ternary stability, do satisfy an analogous regularity lemma -- hence strong ternary stability cannot be characterized simply by excluded hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Clique complexes of strongly regular graphs, their eigenvalues, and cohomology groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that non-isomorphic strongly regular graphs with the same parameters must be cospectral (have the same eigenvalues). In this paper, we investigate whether the spectra of higher order Laplacians associated with these graphs can distinguish them. In this direction, we study the clique complexes of strongly regular graphs, and determine the spectra of the triangle complexes of several families of strongly regular graphs including Hamming graphs and Triangular graphs. In many cases, the spectrum of the triangle complex distinguishes between strongly regular graphs with the same parameters, but we find some examples where that is not the case. We also prove that if a graph has the property that for any induced cycle, there are four consecutive vertices on the cycle with a common neighbor, then the first cohomology group of the graph is trivial and we apply this result to several families of graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral extrema of graphs forbidding a fan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, its spectral radius is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. A fan $H_{\ell}$ is a graph obtained by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of a path of order $\ell\geq4$. Let ${\rm SPEX(n,H_{\ell})}$ be the set of all extremal graphs $G$ of order $n$ with the maximum spectral radius, where $G$ contains no $H_{\ell}$ as a subgraph. In this paper, we completely characterized the graphs in ${\rm SPEX(n,H_{\ell})}$ for any $\ell\geq4$ and sufficiently large $n$. An interesting phenomenon was revealed: ${\rm SPEX(n,H_{2k+2})}\subseteq {\rm SPEX(n,H_{2k+3})}$ for any $k\geq1$ and sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>A generalization of an ear decomposition and k-trees in highly connected star-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a generalized version of an ear decomposition, called a $j$-spider decomposition, for $j$-connected star-free graphs with $j \geq 2$. Its application enables us to improve a previousely known sufficient condition for the existence of a $k$-tree in highly connected star-free graphs, where a $k$-tree is a spanning tree in which every vertex is of degree at most $k$. More precisely, we show that every $j$-connected $K_{1,j(k-2)+2}$-free graph has a $k$-tree for $k\ge j$, thereby improving a classical result of Jackson and Wormald for $k\ge j$. Our approach differs from previous studies based on toughness-type arguments and instead relies on both a~$j$-spider decomposition and a factor theorem related to Hall's marriage theorem.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tur\'an results for disjoint copies of degenerate graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Tur\'{a}n number $\mathrm{ex}(n, H, F)$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. For an integer $t \geq 1$, let $tF$ be the vertex-disjoint union of $t$ copies of $F$. Gerbner, Methuku, and Vizer (2019) established an asymptotically sharp bound for $\mathrm{ex}(n,K_r,(t+1)K_{2,b})$. We extend their results in two directions by considering forbidden graphs $(t+1)K_{a,b}$ and $(t+1)C_{2k}$ and establish more precise matching upper and lower bounds of the same order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Proof of the Polynomial Version of van der Waerden's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polynomial version of van der Waerden's theorem, proved using dynamical systems by V. Bergelson and A. Leibman in 1996, \cite{Bergelson1996}, significantly highlighted the role of dynamical systems in addressing problems related to monochromatic configurations within algebraic structures. In this paper, by introducing symbolic polynomials, we aim to provide an alternative proof of the polynomial version of van der Waerden's theorem relying solely on Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of an infinite discrete semigroup.</description>

      <title>A refined twist on Hurwitz numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter refinement of the Jucys-Murphy theory, that we call the CJT-refinement, unifying Schur, zonal, and, conjecturally, Jack actions of the ring of symmetric functions on the Fock space. Applications of this formalism include a partial resolution of a recent conjecture of Coulter-Do, as well as cut-and-join recursion for $b$-Hurwitz numbers. The cut-and-join equations enable the derivation of the tropicalization of $b$--Hurwitz numbers. We also provide a first application of this tropical interpretation by answering an open problem of Chapuy-Do{\l}\k{e}ga on the polynomial structure of $b$-Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Induced Minors, Asymptotic Dimension, and Baker's Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic dimension is a large-scale invariant of metric spaces that was introduced by Gromov (1993). We prove that every hereditary class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as a fat minor has asymptotic dimension at most $2$, which is optimal. This makes substantial progress on a question of Bonamy, Bousquet, Esperet, Groenland, Liu, Pirot, and Scott (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 2023).
  The key to our proof is a notion inspired by Baker's technique (J. ACM 1994). We say that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded Baker-treewidth if there exists a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that, for every graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, there is a layering of $G$ such that the subgraph induced by the union of any $\ell$ consecutive layers has treewidth at most $f(\ell)$. We show that every class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as an induced minor has bounded Baker-treewidth. We discuss further applications of this result to clustered colouring and the design of linear-time approximate schemes.</description>

      <title>Round Aztec windows, a dual of the Aztec diamond theorem and a curious symmetry of the correlation of diagonal slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairly shortly after the publication of the Aztec diamond theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen and Propp in 1992, interest arose in finding the number of domino tilings of an Aztec diamond with an ``Aztec window,'' i.e.\ a hole in the shape of a smaller Aztec diamond at its center. Several intriguing patterns were discovered for the number of tilings of such regions, but the numbers themselves were not ``round'' -- they didn't seem to be given by a simple product formula. In this paper we consider a very closely related shape of holes (namely, odd Aztec rectangles), and prove that a large variety of regions obtained from Aztec rectangles by making such holes in them possess the sought-after property that the number of their domino tilings is given by a simple product formula. We find the same to be true for certain symmetric cruciform regions. We also consider graphs obtained from a toroidal Aztec diamond by making such holes in them, and prove a simple formula that governs the way the number of their perfect matchings changes under a natural evolution of the holes. This yields in particular a natural dual of the Aztec diamond theorem. Some implications for the correlation of such holes are also presented, including an unexpected symmetry for the correlation of diagonal slits on the square grid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subgraph number of a vertex in a graph is defined as the number of connected subgraphs containing that vertex. The graph and its vertex which correspond to the minimum subgraph number among all graphs on $n$ vertices and $k$ cut vertices have been characterised. Further, using this characterisation, the graphs with the minimum number of connected subgraphs among all graphs on $n$ vertices and $k$ cut vertices, with girth at least $k$, have been obtained. This turns out to characterise the graphs with the minimum number of connected subgraphs among all graphs on $n$ vertices and $k$ cut vertices for $0 \leq k \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Large Phylogenetic Mixtures for Many Phylogenetic Model Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifiability of phylogenetic models is a necessary condition to ensure that the model parameters can be uniquely determined from data. Mixture models are phylogenetic models where the probability distributions in the model are convex combinations of distributions in simpler phylogenetic models. Mixture models are used to model heterogeneity in the substitution process in DNA sequences. While many basic phylogenetic models are known to be identifiable, mixture models in generality have only been shown to be identifiable in certain cases. We expand the main theorem of [Rhodes, Sullivant 2012] to prove identifiability of mixture models in equivariant phylogenetic models, specifically the Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter model, Kimura 3-parameter model and the Strand Symmetric model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify all finite 2-groups that have a cyclic or dihedral maximal subgroup and determine their automorphism groups. Based on this result, we classify all pairs $ (G,\mathcal{M}) $, such that $ G $ is a finite 2-group and $ \mathcal{M} $ is a $ G $-arc-transitive map with Euler characteristic not being divisible by 4.</description>

      <title>A Structural Linear-Time Algorithm for Computing the Tutte Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The block-cut tree decomposes a connected graph along its cutvertices, displaying its 2-connected components. The Tutte-decomposition extends this idea to 2-separators in 2-connected graphs, yielding a canonical tree-decomposition that decomposes the graph into its triconnected components. In 1973, Hopcroft and Tarjan introduced a linear-time algorithm to compute the Tutte-decomposition. Cunningham and Edmonds later established a structural characterization of the Tutte-decomposition via totally-nested 2-separations. We present a conceptually simple algorithm based on this characterization, which computes the Tutte-decomposition in linear time. Our algorithm first computes all totally-nested 2-separations and then builds the Tutte-decomposition from them.
  Along the way, we derive new structural results on the structure of totally-nested 2-separations in 2-connected graphs using a novel notion of stability, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sandwich Monotonicity and the Recognition of Weighted Graph Classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-weighted graphs play an important role in the theory of Robinsonian matrices and similarity theory, particularly via the concept of level graphs, that is, graphs obtained from an edge-weighted graph by removing all sufficiently light edges. This suggest a natural way of associating to any class $\mathcal{G}$ of unweighted graphs a corresponding class of edge-weighted graphs, namely by requiring that all level graphs belong to $\mathcal{G}$. We show that weighted graphs for which all level graphs are split, threshold, or chain graphs can be recognized in linear time using special edge elimination orderings. We obtain these results by introducing the notion of degree sandwich monotone graph classes. A graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is sandwich monotone if every edge set which may be removed from a graph in $\mathcal{G}$ without leaving the class also contains a single edge that can be safely removed. Furthermore, if we require the safe edge to fulfill a certain degree property, then $\mathcal{G}$ is called degree sandwich monotone. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a linear-time recognition algorithm for any weighted graph class whose corresponding unweighted class is degree sandwich monotone and contains all edgeless graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this sequel paper, we continue the analysis of the prime order element graph $\Gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$, where vertices are elements of $G$ and edges connect distinct elements $x, y$ satisfying $\circ(xy) = p$ for some prime $p$. Our investigation focuses on the adjacency and Laplacian spectra, planarity, and clique number of this graph. We conclude by outlining open issues and potential directions for future investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structure (a countably infinite ultrahomogeneous structure). We call an embedding $f : A \to M$ extensive if each automorphism of its image extends to an automorphism of $M$, where the extension map respects composition. We consider which Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structures $M$ have the property that each substructure admits an extensive embedding into $M$. We also consider which Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structures have a stationary weak independence relation (SWIR) as defined by Li, and discuss the relationship between SWIRs and extensive embeddings.</description>

      <title>The Matching Ramsey Number of Hypergraphs, Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that a hypergraph ${\mathcal H}$ and an arbitrary nonempty (finite or infinite) set of available colors are given. Each color $x$ is associated with a frequency $\tau (x)$, where the set of all such frequencies is bounded. We define a new parameter called the {\it $\tau$-matching chromatic number}, denoted by $\chi_M(\tau, {\mathcal H})$, as the least possible number of colors required to color the edges of ${\mathcal H}$ in such a way that the size of each nonempty monochromatic matching does not exceed the frequency of the corresponding color associated to its edges. The well-known and extensively well-studied chromatic number of general Kneser hypergraph $\chi \left( {\rm KG}^r({\mathcal H}) \right)$ is a special case of $\chi_M(\tau, {\mathcal H})$ when all color frequencies are the fixed constant $r-1$.
  In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds for the parameter $\chi_M(\tau , {\mathcal H})$, utilizing the concepts of the alternation number and the equitable colorability defect.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory for the free left-regular band and a q-analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine from an invariant theory viewpoint the monoid algebras for two monoids having large symmetry groups. The first monoid is the free left-regular band on $n$ letters, defined on the set of all injective words, that is, the words with at most one occurrence of each letter. This monoid carries the action of the symmetric group. The second monoid is one of its $q$-analogues, considered by K. Brown, carrying an action of the finite general linear group. In both cases, we show that the invariant subalgebras are semisimple commutative algebras, and characterize them using Stirling and $q$-Stirling numbers.
  We then use results from the theory of random walks and random-to-top shuffling to decompose the entire monoid algebra into irreducibles, simultaneously as a module over the invariant ring and as a group representation. Our irreducible decompositions are described in terms of derangement symmetric functions introduced by D\'esarm\'enien and Wachs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of points $S$ in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called \textit{Ramsey} if any finite partition of $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ yields a monochromatic copy of $S$. While characterization of Ramsey set remains a major open problem in the area, a stronger ``density'' concept was considered in [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 3, 1--7, 1990]: If $S$ is a $d$-dimensional simplex, then for any $\mu&gt;0$ there is an integer $d:=d(S,\mu)$ and finite configuration $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ such that any subconfiguration $Y\subseteq X$ with $|Y|\geq \mu |X|$ contains a copy of $S$. Complementing this, here we show the existence of $\mu:=\mu(S)$ and of an infinite configuration $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ with the property that any finite coloring of $X$ yields a monochromatic copy of $S$, yet for any finite set of points $Y\subseteq X$ contains a subset $Z\subseteq Y$ of size $|Z|\geq \mu |Y|$ without a copy of $S$.</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration and Estimation of Related Constants of Grid Graphs and Their Variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We applied tensor network contraction algorithms to compute the hard-core lattice gas model, i.e., the enumeration of independent sets on grid graphs. We observed the influence of surface effect and parity effect on the enumeration (and entropy), and derived upper and lower bounds for both the combinatorics entropy and the coefficients of surface effect by numerical analysis.
  Additionally, we conducted corresponding calculations and analyses for triangular grid graphs, king graph, and cylindrical grid graph. We computed and analyzed their associated constants and compared how different adjacency and boundary conditions affect these constants.
  Our computational results have contributed substantial new terms to the OEIS sequence A089980, A027740, A219741, A226444, A245013 and A286513. In addition, we have provided fairly accurate estimates of the relevant constants through numerical analysis of the obtained results. Among them, our valuation of the hard square entropy constant is more accurate than existing results. And we conject that the surface effect of the periodic boundary of the cylindrical grid graph is $0$--its estimated value of coefficients is very close to $0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis makes the fundamental observation that any finite lattice $(L, \leq)$ is determined up to isomorphism by the restriction of the relation ${\leq} \subseteq L \times L$ to the set $J(L) \times M(L)$, where $J(L)$ is the set of join-irreducible elements of $L$ and $M(L)$ is the set of meet-irreducible elements of $L$.
  For any finite lattice $L$ equipped with the action of a finite group $G$, we explicitly describe this restricted relation for the lattice of transfer systems $\mathsf{Tr}(L)$ in terms of $L$ only. We apply this to give new computations of the number of transfer systems for certain finite groups, and to produce bounds on the number of transfer systems on certain families of abelian finite groups. We also provide computer code to enable other researchers' use of these techniques.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of graphs which we call average hereditary graphs. Many graphs that occur in the usual graph theory applications belong to this class of graphs. Many popular types of graphs fall under this class, such as regular graphs, trees and other popular classes of graphs. The paper aims to explore some interesting properties regarding colorings average hereditary graphs. We prove a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of its maximum average degree and show that this bound is an improvement on previous bounds. From this, we show a relationship between the average degree and the chromatic number of an average hereditary graph. We then show that even with new bound, the graph 3-coloring problem remains NP-hard when the input is restricted to average hereditary graphs. We provide an equivalent condition for a graph to be average hereditary, through which we show that we can decide if a given graph is average hereditary in polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree balance plays an important role in various research areas in phylogenetics and computer science. Typically, it is measured with the help of a balance index or imbalance index. There are more than 25 such indices available, recently surveyed in a book by Fischer et al. They are used to rank rooted binary trees on a scale from the most balanced to the least balanced. We show that a wide range of subtree-size based measures satisfying concavity and monotonicity conditions are minimized by the complete or greedy-from-the-bottom (GFB) tree and maximized by the caterpillar tree, yielding an infinitely large family of distinct new imbalance indices. Answering an open question from the literature, we show that one such established measure, the $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic, has the GFB tree as its unique minimizer. We also provide an alternative characterization of GFB trees, showing that they are equivalent to complete trees, which arise in different contexts. We give asymptotic bounds on the expected $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic under the uniform and Yule-Harding distributions of trees, and answer questions for the related $Q$-shape statistic as well.</description>

Abstract: We show coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. We further show the coordinate rings of (generalized) open Richardson varieties on the twisted product of flag varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. This includes, as special cases, reduced double Bruhat cells, Bott-Samelson varieties, braid varieties. Our results generalize various results by Casals--Gorsky--Gorsky--Le--Shen--Simental and Galashin--Lam--Sherman-Bennett--Speyer in finite types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the cohomology class of any curve on a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least 4 is an even multiple of the minimal class. The same holds for the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold. This disproves the integral Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties and shows that very general cubic threefolds are not stably rational. Our proof is motivated by tropical geometry; it relies on multivariable Mumford constructions, monodromy considerations, and the combinatorial theory of matroids.</description>

Abstract: In this note we connect Sobolev estimates in the context of polynomial averages e.g. \[ \| \int_0^1 \prod_{k=1}^m f_k(x-t^k) \|_{1} \leq \text{Const} \cdot 2^{-\text{const} \cdot l} \prod_{i=1}^m \| f_k \|_m \] whenever some $f_i$ vanishes on $\{ |\xi| \leq 2^l \}$ to the existence of polynomial progressions inside of sets of sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension, in analogy with work of Peluse in the discrete context. Our strongest (unconditional) result builds off deep work of Hu-Lie and is as follows: suppose that $\mathcal{P} = \{P_1,P_2,P_3\}$ vanish at the origin at different rates, and that $E \subset [0,1]$ has sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension, \[ 1 - \text{const}(\mathcal{P}) &lt; \text{dim}_H(E) &lt; 1 \] and Hausdorff content bounded away from zero, sufficiently large in terms of its dimension. Then $E$ contains a non-trivial polynomial progression of the form \[ \{ x , x - P_1(t), x - P_2(t), x - P_3(t) \} \subset E, \; \; \; t \neq 0. \] We also provide a short proof that whenever $E$ has sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension and Fourier dimension $&gt; 1/2$, it necessarily contains a non-trivial generalized three-term arithmetic progression of the form \[ \{ x, x - \theta_1 t, x- \theta_2 t\} \subset E, \; \; \; \theta_i \in \mathbb{Q},\ t \neq 0.\]</description>
