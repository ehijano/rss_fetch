      <title>Generative Market Equilibrium Models with Stable Adversarial Learning via Reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general computational framework for solving continuous-time financial market equilibria under minimal modeling assumptions while incorporating realistic financial frictions, such as trading costs, and supporting multiple interacting agents. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), our approach employs a novel generative deep reinforcement learning framework with a decoupling feedback system embedded in the adversarial training loop, which we term as the \emph{reinforcement link}. This architecture stabilizes the training dynamics by incorporating feedback from the discriminator. Our theoretically guided feedback mechanism enables the decoupling of the equilibrium system, overcoming challenges that hinder conventional numerical algorithms. Experimentally, our algorithm not only learns but also provides testable predictions on how asset returns and volatilities emerge from the endogenous trading behavior of market participants, where traditional analytical methods fall short. The design of our model is further supported by an approximation guarantee.</description>

      <title>A note on time-inconsistent stochastic control problems with higher-order moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the research on time-consistent stochastic control problems with higher-order moments, as formulated by [Y. Wang et al. SIAM J. Control. Optim., 63 (2025), in press]. We consider a linear controlled dynamic equation with state-dependent diffusion, and let the sum of a conventional mean-variance utility and a fairly general function of higher-order central moments be the objective functional. We obtain both the sufficiency and necessity of the equilibrium condition for an open-loop Nash equilibrium control (ONEC), under some continuity and integrability assumptions that are more relaxed and natural than those employed before. Notably, we derive an extended version of the stochastic Lebesgue differentiation theorem for necessity, because the equilibrium condition is represented by some diagonal processes generated by a flow of backward stochastic differential equations whose the data do not necessarily satisfy the usual square-integrability. Based on the derived equilibrium condition, we obtain the algebra equation for a deterministic ONEC. In particular, we find that the mean-variance equilibrium strategy is an ONEC for our higher-order moment problem if and only if the objective functional satisfies a homogeneity condition.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a macroscopic market making model \`a la Avellaneda-Stoikov, using continuous processes for orders instead of discrete point processes. The model intends to bridge the gap between market making and optimal execution problems, while shedding light on the influence of order flows on the optimal strategies. We demonstrate our model through three problems. The study provides a comprehensive analysis from Markovian to non-Markovian noises and from linear to non-linear intensity functions, encompassing both bounded and unbounded coefficients. Mathematically, the contribution lies in the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control, guaranteed by the well-posedness of the strong solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and the (non-)Lipschitz forward-backward stochastic differential equation. Finally, the model's applications to price impact and optimal execution are discussed.</description>

      <title>ajdmom: A Python Package for Deriving Moment Formulas of Affine Jump Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ajdmom, a Python package designed for automatically deriving moment formulae for the well-established affine jump diffusion processes with state-independent jump intensities. ajdmom can produce explicit closed-form expressions for conditional and unconditional moments of any order, significantly enhancing the usability of these models. Additionally, ajdmom can compute partial derivatives of these moments with respect to the model parameters, offering a valuable tool for sensitivity analysis. The package's modular architecture makes it easy for adaptation and extension by researchers. ajdmom is open-source and readily available for installation from GitHub or the Python package index (PyPI).</description>
