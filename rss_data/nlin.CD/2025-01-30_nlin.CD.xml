      <title>Controlling Transient Chaos in the Lorenz System with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sustain transient chaos in the Lorenz system through the estimation of safety functions using a transformer-based model. Unlike classical methods that rely on iterative computations, the proposed model directly predicts safety functions without requiring fine-tuning or extensive system knowledge. The results demonstrate that this approach effectively maintains chaotic trajectories within the desired phase space region, even in the presence of noise, making it a viable alternative to traditional methods. A detailed comparison of safety functions, safe sets, and their control performance highlights the strengths and trade-offs of the two approaches.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Fractal Basins Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network models have recently demonstrated impressive prediction performance in complex systems where chaos and unpredictability appear. In spite of the research efforts carried out on predicting future trajectories or improving their accuracy compared to numerical methods, not sufficient work has been done by using deep learning techniques in which they characterize the unpredictability of chaotic systems or give a general view of the global unpredictability of a system. In this work we propose a novel approach based on deep learning techniques to measure the fractal dimension of the basins of attraction of the Duffing oscillator for a variety of parameters. As a consequence, we provide an algorithm capable of predicting fractal dimension measures as accurately as the conventional algorithm, but with a computation speed about ten times faster.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Levy walks in the lifted Pomeau-Manneville map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and Trotter transitions in unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body dynamics where the evolution is governed by unitary circuits through the lens of `Krylov complexity', a recently proposed measure of complexity and quantum chaos. We extend the formalism of Krylov complexity to unitary circuit dynamics and focus on Floquet circuits arising as the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian dynamics. For short Trotter steps the results from Hamiltonian dynamics are recovered, whereas a large Trotter step results in different universal behavior characterized by the existence of local maximally ergodic operators: operators with vanishing autocorrelation functions, as exemplified in dual-unitary circuits. These operators exhibit maximal complexity growth, act as a memoryless bath for the dynamics, and can be directly probed in current quantum computing setups. These two regimes are separated by a crossover in chaotic systems. Conversely, we find that free integrable systems exhibit a nonanalytic transition between these different regimes, where maximally ergodic operators appear at a critical Trotter step.</description>

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>
