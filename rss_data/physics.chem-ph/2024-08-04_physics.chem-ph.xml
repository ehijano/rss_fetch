      <description>arXiv:2408.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, conventional chemistry techniques have faced significant challenges due to their inherent limitations, struggling to cope with the increasing complexity and volume of data generated in contemporary research endeavors. Computational methodologies represent robust tools in the field of chemistry, offering the capacity to harness potent machine-learning models to yield insightful analytical outcomes. This review delves into the spectrum of computational strategies available for natural product analysis and constructs a research framework for investigating both qualitative and quantitative chemistry problems. Our objective is to present a novel perspective on the symbiosis of machine learning and chemistry, with the potential to catalyze a transformation in the field of natural product analysis.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-containing Surface Ligands Lead to False Positives for Photofixation of N$_2$ on Metal Oxide Nanocrystals: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many ligands commonly used to prepare nanoparticle catalysts with precise nanoscale features contain nitrogen (e.g., oleylamine); here, we found that the use of nitrogen-containing ligands during the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticle catalysts substantially impacted product analysis during photocatalytic studies. We confirmed these experimental results via hybrid Density Functional Theory computations of the materials' electronic properties to evaluate their viability as photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction. This nitrogen ligand contamination, and subsequent interference in photocatalytic studies, is avoidable through the careful design of synthetic pathways that exclude nitrogen-containing constituents. This result highlights the urgent need for careful evaluation of catalyst synthesis protocols, as contamination by nitrogen-containing ligands may go unnoticed since the presence of nitrogen is often not detected or probed.</description>

      <title>Orientational order in liquid crystal surface induced by evaporation of water droplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaporation of a droplet induces variety of ordered patterns near the contact line between the droplet and a substrate. This pattern formation involves both the behavior of colloidal suspensions and interactions between a droplet and a substrate. Although studies on the effect of the behavior of colloidal suspensions on the deposition process have been actively conducted, studies on the effect of the interaction between a droplet and a substrate have not been actively conducted because the observation of the interaction is difficult owing to the lack of structural changes in the substrate by the interaction. In this study, we investigated the solvent-substrate interactions by using a water droplet and liquid crystals as a substrate, where the liquid crystals were placed on a glass slide. The orientation patterns of the liquid crystals were induced at the contact line between the water droplet and the liquid crystal and were observed using a polarized optical microscope. Pinning and depinning events were observed at a certain anchoring strength of the liquid crystal on the glass slide and formed linear patterns on the surface of the liquid crystal. Additionally, the interfacial tension between the water and liquid crystal slowly varied at this anchoring strength owing to the variation in the orientation of the liquid crystals. These results indicated that the evaporation-induced patterns appeared when the strength of the solvent-substrate interactions was neutral. The interaction between a droplet and a substrate is important for the fabrication of desired ordered patterns.</description>

      <title>Slow Voltage Relaxation of Silicon Nanoparticles with a Chemo-Mechanical Core-Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon presents itself as a high-capacity anode material for lithium-ion batteries with a promising future. The high ability for lithiation comes along with massive volume changes and a problematic voltage hysteresis, causing reduced efficiency, detrimental heat generation, and a complicated state-of-charge estimation. During slow cycling, amorphous silicon nanoparticles show a larger voltage hysteresis than after relaxation periods. Interestingly, the voltage relaxes for at least several days, which has not been physically explained so far. We apply a chemo-mechanical continuum model in a core-shell geometry interpreted as a silicon particle covered by the solid-electrolyte interphase to account for the hysteresis phenomena. The silicon core (de)lithiates during every cycle while the covering shell is chemically inactive. The visco-elastoplastic behavior of the shell explains the voltage hysteresis during cycling and after relaxation. We identify a logarithmic voltage relaxation, which fits with the established Garofalo law for viscosity. Our chemo-mechanical model describes the observed voltage hysteresis phenomena and outperforms the empirical Plett model. In addition to our full model, we present a reduced model to allow for easy voltage profile estimations. The presented results support the mechanical explanation of the silicon voltage hysteresis with a core-shell model and encourage further efforts into the investigation of the silicon anode mechanics.</description>

      <title>Molecular influence on nuclear-quadrupole-coupling effects in laser induced alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the effect of nuclear-quadrupole interactions on the field-free impulsive alignment of different asymmetric-top molecules. Our analysis is focused on the influence of the hyperfine- and rotational-energy-level structures. These depend on the number of nuclear spins, the rotational constants, and the symmetry of the tensors involved in the nuclear spin and external field interactions. Comparing the prototypical large-nuclear-spin molecules iodobenzene, 1,2-diiodobenzene, 1,3-diiodobenzene, and 2,5-diiodobenzonitrile, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the hyperfine splittings compared to the rotational-energy splittings plays a crucial role in the spin-rotational dynamics after the laser pulse. Moreover, we point out that the impact of the quadrupole coupling on the rotational dynamics decreases when highly excited rotational states dominate the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Accurate Analytic Model for the Energy Spectrum of the Anharmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work we have derived an analytic expression for the partition function of the quartic oscillator using a path integral formalism. Quite remarkably, the free energy was found to be accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and quartic coupling constant. In addition, the key features of the exact partition function were successfully reproduced. Accurate analytic expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies as function of $g$ were derived. In this work, we extend our results to the calculation of the full energy spectrum. We also generalize our study of the quartic oscillator to the case of the anharmonic oscillator with sextic and octic couplings. The energy levels found are accurate for all couplings and principal quantum numbers considered here (up to $n=8$), confirming this model partition function as a good and faithful approximation of the exact one.</description>

      <title>Free energy, rates, and mechanism of transmembrane dimerization in lipid bilayers from dynamically unbiased molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assembly of proteins in membranes plays a key role in many crucial cellular pathways. Despite their importance, characterizing transmembrane assembly remains challenging for experiments and simulations. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations do not cover the time scales required to sample the typical transmembrane assembly. Hence, most studies rely on enhanced sampling schemes that steer the dynamics of transmembrane proteins along a collective variable that should encode all slow degrees of freedom. However, given the complexity of the condensed-phase lipid environment, this is far from trivial, with the consequence that free energy profiles of dimerization can be poorly converged. Here, we introduce an alternative approach, which relies only on simulating short, dynamically unbiased trajectory segments, avoiding using collective variables or biasing forces. By merging all trajectories, we obtain free energy profiles, rates, and mechanisms of transmembrane dimerization with the same set of simulations. We showcase our algorithm by sampling the spontaneous association and dissociation of a transmembrane protein in a lipid bilayer, the popular coarse-grained Martini force field. Our algorithm represents a promising way to investigate assembly processes in biologically relevant membranes, overcoming some of the challenges of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Quantum Chemical Calculations with Improved Machine-Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Easy and effective usage of computational resources is crucial for scientific calculations. Following our recent work of machine-learning (ML) assisted scheduling optimization [Ref: J. Comput. Chem. 2023, 44, 1174], we further propose 1) the improve ML models for the better predictions of computational loads, and as such, more elaborate load-balancing calculations can be expected; 2) the idea of coded computation, i.e. the integration of gradient coding, in order to introduce fault tolerance during the distributed calculations; and 3) their applications together with re-normalized exciton model with time-dependent density functional theory (REM-TDDFT) for calculating the excited states. Illustrated benchmark calculations include P38 protein, and solvent model with one or several excitable centers. The results show that the improved ML-assisted coded calculations can further improve the load-balancing and cluster utilization, and owing primarily profit in fault tolerance that aiming at the automated quantum chemical calculations for both ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and quantum electrodynamics effects on NMR shielding tensors of Tl$X$ ($X$ = H, F, Cl, Br, I, At) molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results of relativistic calculations of nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensors ($\sigma$) for the thallium monocation (Tl$^+$), thallium hydride (TlH) and thallium halides (TlF, TlCl, TlBr, TlI, and TlAt) are presented as obtained within a four-component polarization propagator formalism and a two-component linear response approach within the zeroth-order regular approximation. Additionally, some quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects on those NMR shieldings are estimated. A strong dependence of $\sigma$(Tl) on the bonding partner is found, together with a very weak dependence of QED effects with them. In order to explain the trends observed, the excitation patterns associated with relativistic $ee$ (or paramagnetic-like) and $pp$ (or diamagnetic-like) contributions to $\sigma$ are analyzed. For this purpose, also the electronic spin-free and spin-dependent contributions are separated within the two-component zeroth-order regular approximation, and the influence of spin-orbit coupling on involved molecular orbitals is studied, which allows for a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum state tracking and control of a single molecular ion in a thermal environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecular state evolution is central to many disciplines, including molecular dynamics, precision measurement, and molecule-based quantum technology. Details of the evolution are obscured when observing a statistical ensemble of molecules. Here, we reported real-time observations of thermal radiation-driven transitions between individual states ("jumps") of a single molecule. We reversed these "jumps" through microwave-driven transitions, resulting in a twentyfold improvement in the time the molecule dwells in a chosen state. The measured transition rates showed anisotropy in the thermal environment, pointing to the possibility of using single molecules as in-situ probes for the strengths of ambient fields. Our approaches for state detection and manipulation could apply to a wide range of species, facilitating their uses in fields including quantum science, molecular physics, and ion-neutral chemistry.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes escape transitions.</description>
