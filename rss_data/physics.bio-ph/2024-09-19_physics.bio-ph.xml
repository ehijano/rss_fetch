      <title>Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasi-species concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called ``Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the ``Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalise this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to changes in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering that the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution are an order parameter.</description>

      <title>The structure of inter-reaction times in reaction-diffusion processes and consequences for counting statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are quantified by counts of observable events, from the annihilation of quasiparticles in a lattice to predator-prey encounters on a landscape to spikes in a neural network. These events are triggered at random intervals when an underlying dynamical system occupies a set of reactive states in its phase space. We derive a general expression for the distribution of times between events in such counting processes assuming the underlying triggering dynamics is a stochastic process that converges to a stationary distribution. Our results contribute to resolving a long-standing dichotomy in the study of reaction-diffusion processes, showing the inter-reaction point process interpolates between a reaction- and a diffusion-limited regime. At low reaction rates, the inter-reaction process is Poisson with a rate depending on stationary properties of the event-triggering stochastic process. At high reaction rates, inter-reaction times are dominated by the hitting times to the reactive states. To further illustrate the power of this approach we apply our framework to obtain the counting statistics of two counting processes appearing in several biophysical scenarios. First, we study the common situation of estimating an animal's activity level by how often it crosses a detector, showing that the mean number of crossing events can decrease monotonically with the hitting rate, a seemingly 'paradoxical' result that could possibly lead to misinterpretation of experimental count data. Second, we derive the ensemble statistics for the detection of many particles, recovering and generalizing known results in the biophysics of chemosensation. Overall, we develop a unifying theoretical framework to quantify inter-event time distributions in reaction-diffusion systems that clarifies existing debates in the literature and provide examples of application to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A weather-driven mathematical model of Culex population abundance and the impact of vector control interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even as the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile Virus (WNV) in North America has risen over the past decade, effectively modelling mosquito population density or, the abundance has proven to be a persistent challenge. It is critical to capture the fluctuations in mosquito abundance across seasons in order to forecast the varying risk of disease transmission from one year to the next. We develop a process-based mechanistic weather-driven Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model to study the population biology of both aqueous and terrestrial stages of mosquito population. The progression of mosquito lifecycle through these stages is influenced by different factors, including temperature, daylight hours, intra-species competition and the availability of aquatic habitats. Weather-driven parameters are utilised in our work, are a combination of laboratory research and literature data. In our model, we include precipitation data as a substitute for evaluating additional mortality in the mosquito population. We compute the \textit{Basic offspring number} of the associated model and perform sensitivity analysis. Finally, we employ our model to assess the effectiveness of various adulticides strategies to predict the reduction in mosquito population. This enhancement in modelling of mosquito abundance can be instrumental in guiding interventions aimed at reducing mosquito populations and mitigating mosquito-borne diseases such as the WNV.</description>

      <title>Optical Label-Free Microscopy Characterization of Dielectric Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to relate nanoparticle properties to function, fast and detailed particle characterization, is needed. The ability to characterize nanoparticle samples using optical microscopy techniques has drastically improved over the past few decades; consequently, there are now numerous microscopy methods available for detailed characterization of particles with nanometric size. However, there is currently no ``one size fits all'' solution to the problem of nanoparticle characterization. Instead, since the available techniques have different detection limits and deliver related but different quantitative information, the measurement and analysis approaches need to be selected and adapted for the sample at hand. In this tutorial, we review the optical theory of single particle scattering and how it relates to the differences and similarities in the quantitative particle information obtained from commonly used microscopy techniques, with an emphasis on nanometric (submicron) sized dielectric particles. Particular emphasis is placed on how the optical signal relates to mass, size, structure, and material properties of the detected particles and to its combination with diffusivity-based particle sizing. We also discuss emerging opportunities in the wake of new technology development, with the ambition to guide the choice of measurement strategy based on various challenges related to different types of nanoparticle samples and associated analytical demands.</description>
