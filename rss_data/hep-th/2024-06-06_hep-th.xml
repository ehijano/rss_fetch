      <title>On equivalence of gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several approaches to formulate gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin field in $d$ dimensions including the following: (i) in terms of symmetric tensor fields $\phi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, with $k = s, s-1, \dots , 0$, restricted to be double traceless for $k\geq 4$; and (ii) in terms of a quartet of $traceful$ symmetric tensor fields $\psi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, of rank $k=s,s-1,s-2, s-3$. We demonstrate that these formulations in Minkowski space ${\mathbb M}^d$ are equivalent to the gauge-invariant theory for a massive integer-spin field proposed in 1989 by Pashnev. We also make use of the Klishevich-Zinoviev theory in ${\mathbb M}^d$ to derive a generalisation of the Singh-Hagen model for a massive integer-spin field in $d&gt;4 $ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalised symmetries and state-operator correspondence for nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a one-to-one correspondence between line operators and states in four-dimensional CFTs with continuous 1-form symmetries. In analogy with 0-form symmetries in two dimensions, such CFTs have a free photon realisation and enjoy an infinite-dimensional current algebra that generalises the familiar Kac-Moody algebras. We construct the representation theory of this current algebra, which allows for a full description of the space of states on an arbitrary closed spatial slice. On $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^1$, we rederive the spectrum by performing a path integral on $\mathbb{B}^3\times\mathbb{S}^1$ with insertions of line operators. This leads to a direct and explicit correspondence between the line operators of the theory and the states on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^1$. Interestingly, we find that the vacuum state is not prepared by the empty path integral but by a squeezing operator. Additionally, we generalise some of our results in two directions. Firstly, we construct current algebras in $(2p+2)$-dimensional CFTs, that are universal whenever the theory has a $p$-form symmetry, and secondly we provide a non-invertible generalisation of those higher-dimensional current algebras.</description>

      <title>A Bootstrap Principle for the Spectrum and Scattering of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Veneziano amplitude of string theory is the unique solution to an analytically solvable bootstrap problem. Uniqueness follows from two assumptions: faster than power-law falloff in high-energy scattering and the existence of some infinite sequence in momentum transfer at which higher-spin exchanges cancel. The string amplitude$\unicode{x2013}$including the mass spectrum$\unicode{x2013}$is an output of this bootstrap. If the amplitude merely vanishes at high energies, the solution is a three-parameter family containing the Veneziano, Coon, and hypergeometric amplitudes, and more.</description>

      <title>The Higgs Branch of 6d (1,0) SCFTs &amp; LSTs with DE-type SUSY Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail the Higgs branches of 6d $(1,0)$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) and little string theories (LSTs) that exhibit supersymmetry-enhancing Higgs branch renormalization group flows to the 6d $(2,0)$ SCFTs and LSTs of type DE. Generically, such theories are geometrically engineered in F-theory via a configuration of $(-2)$-curves, arranged in an (affine) DE-type Dynkin diagram, and supporting special unitary gauge algebras; this describes the effective field theory on the tensor branch of the SCFT. For the Higgsable to D-type $(2,0)$ SCFTs/LSTs, there generically also exists a Type IIA brane description, involving a Neveu--Schwarz orientifold plane, which allows for the derivation of a magnetic quiver for the Higgs branch. These are 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ unitary-orthosymplectic quivers whose Coulomb branch is isomorphic to the Higgs branch of the 6d theories. From this magnetic quiver, together with an extended quiver subtraction algorithm that we explain, the foliation structure of the Higgs branch as a symplectic singularity is unveiled. For this class of 6d SCFTs, we observe a simple rule, which we refer to as "slice subtraction," to read off the transverse slice in the foliation from the tensor branch. Based on this slice subtraction observation, we conjecture the transverse slices in the Higgsable to E-type $(2,0)$ Hasse diagram, where the SCFTs lack any known magnetic quiver for their Higgs branches.</description>

      <title>Discrete torsion in gauging non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explain that there exist two complementary generalizations of discrete torsion for non-invertible symmetries in 2d QFT's. Both characterizations are counted by $H^2(G,U(1))$ when one specializes to ordinary finite groups $G$. However, the counting is different for more general fusion categories. Furthermore, only one generalizes the picture of discrete torsion as differences in choices of gauge actions on $B$-fields. We also explain how this same generalization of discrete torsion gives rise to physically-sensible twists on gaugeable algebras and fiber functors.</description>

      <title>Moduli Spaces in CFT: Bootstrap Equation in a Perturbative Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal field theories that exhibit spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry (a moduli space of vacua) must satisfy a set of bootstrap constraints, involving the usual data (scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients) as well as new data such as the spectrum of asymptotic states in the broken vacuum and form factors. The simplest bootstrap equation arises by expanding a two-point function of local operators in two channels, at short distance using the OPE and at large distance using the EFT in the broken vacuum. We illustrate this equation in what is arguably the simplest perturbative model that exhibits conformal symmetry breaking, namely the real $ABC$ model in $d = 4 -\epsilon$ dimensions. We investigate the convergence properties of the bootstrap equation and check explicitly many of the non-trivial relations that it imposes on theory data.</description>

      <title>The Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory on a circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02680v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we bootstrapped the 4-point correlators on the 1D celestial circle using 3D symmetries in the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory as constraints. We find that the dual inversion property is strong enough to replace the crossing symmetry condition when bootstrapping. We also give some results about the conformal block expansion coefficients which contain the spectrum and the leading multi-OPE of this celestial CFT. Finally, we find a non-local 2-particle operator from the multi-OPE at the leading OPE. Although we studied a specific theory, the methods used are valid for general cases.</description>

      <title>Holographic motivations and observational evidence for decreasing dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative lambda gravitational effective field theories dual to holographic CFTs have potentially realistic cosmological solutions. Generic cosmological solutions of these effective field theories have scalar field evolution that can lead to a period of accelerated expansion when the scalar field is at positive values of its potential (Fig. 1). If such a model describes our universe, significant evolution of dark energy is expected over a Hubble time as the scalar descends from positive to negative values of its potential towards the AdS extremum. Our recent observational study 2305.04946 based on supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations suggests that significant evolution of dark energy associated with a descending scalar field may be preferred by data (Fig. 2). Taking a linear approximation to the scalar potential around the present value, a standard likelihood analysis gives an $e^{- \chi^2/2}$ distribution in which $dV/dt$ is presently negative in $99.99 \%$ of the distribution, with a mean fractional variation of the potential of $36 \%$ over the period $z \lessapprox 2$ over which supernova data is available. In this note, we review these theoretical and observational results and provide an update on the question of how the physics of these cosmological solutions can be related to the physics of the underlying CFT.</description>

      <title>New Approach to Strongly Coupled N = 4 SYM via Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02698v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a systematic expansion of the spectrum of free superstrings on AdS${}_5\times $S${}^5$, or equivalently strongly coupled N = 4 SYM in the planar limit, remains an outstanding challenge. No first principle string theory methods are readily available, instead the sole tool at our disposal is the integrability-based Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC). For example, through the QSC the first five orders in the strong coupling expansion of the conformal dimension of an infinite family of short operators have been obtained. However, when using the QSC at strong coupling one must often rely on numerics, and the existing methods for solving the QSC rapidly lose precision as we approach the strong coupling regime.
  In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilises a novel set of QSC variables with a regular strong coupling expansion. We demonstrate how to use this approach to construct a new numerical algorithm that remains stable even at a 't Hooft coupling as large as $10^6$ (or g ~ 100). Employing this approach, we derive new analytic results for some states in the sl(2) sector and beyond. We present a new analytic prediction for a coefficient in the strong coupling expansion of the conformal dimension for the lowest trajectory at a given twist L. For non-lowest trajectories, we uncover a novel feature of mixing with operators outside the sl(2) sector, which manifests as a new type of analytic dependence on the twist.</description>

      <title>KPZ scaling from the Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a superdiffusion exhibiting the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling in late-time correlators and autocorrelators of certain interacting many-body systems has been reported. Inspired by these results, we explore the KPZ scaling in correlation functions using their realization in the Krylov operator basis. We focus on the Heisenberg time scale, which approximately corresponds to the ramp--plateau transition for the Krylov complexity in systems with a large but finite number degrees of freedom. Two frameworks are under consideration: i) the system with growing Lanczos coefficients and an artificial cut-off, and ii) the system with the finite Hilbert space. In both cases via numerical analysis, we observe the transition from Gaussian to KPZ-like scaling at the critical Euclidean time $t_{E}^*=c_{cr}K$, for the Krylov chain of finite length $K$, and $c_{cr}=O(1)$. In particular, we find a scaling $\sim K^{1/3}$ for fluctuations in the one-point correlation function and a dynamical scaling $\sim K^{-2/3}$ associated with the return probability (Loschmidt echo) corresponding to autocorrelators in physical space. In the first case, the transition is of the 3rd order and can be considered as an example of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), while in the second, it is a crossover. For case ii), utilizing the relationship between the spectrum of tridiagonal matrices at the spectral edge and the spectrum of the stochastic Airy operator, we demonstrate analytically the origin of the KPZ scaling for the particular Krylov chain using the results of the probability theory. We argue that there is some outcome of our study for the double scaling limit of matrix models. For the case of topological gravity, the white noise $O(\frac{1}{N})$ term is identified, which should be taken into account in the controversial issue of ensemble averaging in 2D/1D holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first analytical calculation that shows that perturbations with angular dependence can lead to an instability in gauged Q-balls. We find an explicit condition on the parameters for the Q-ball to become unstable. We compare our predictions to the numerical calculation in Kinach et al., and show agreement, including a correct prediction of the instability/stability of the two parameter points analyzed in that paper.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Thermal Transitions from Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic entanglement entropy and revisit thermodynamics and confinement in the dilaton-gravity system. Our analysis focuses on a solvable class of backgrounds that includes AdS and linear dilaton spacetimes as particular cases, with some results extended to general warped metrics. A general lesson is that the behavior of the holographic theory is tied to the bulk curvature singularities. We find that a singular background is confining if and only if i) the singularity coincides with a boundary or ii) it is the linear dilaton. In the former case, for which the singularity cuts off spacetime, we demonstrate that both entanglement entropy and thermodynamics exhibit a first order phase transition. In the linear dilaton case we find instead that both entanglement entropy and thermal phase transitions are of second order. Additionally, along the process we thoroughly derive the radion effective action at quadratic order.</description>

Abstract: Lagrangian formulation for perfect fluid equations which hold invariant under the $\ell$-conformal Galilei group with half-integer $\ell$ is proposed. It is based on a Clebsch-type parametrization and reproduces Lagrangian description of the Euler fluid equations for $\ell=\frac12$.

      <title>Six-Derivative Yang-Mills Couplings in Heterotic String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the structure of six-derivative bosonic couplings in heterotic string theory. First, we determine the maximal covariant and Yang-Mills gauge invariant basis, which consists of 801 independent coupling constants. By imposing T-duality constraints on the circular reduction of these terms, we obtain 468 relations between the coupling constants at the six-derivative order and the known couplings at lower derivative orders. Through the use of field redefinitions, we are able to eliminate the remaining 333 coupling constants. Remarkably, we find that the Yang-Mills field strength only appears through the trace of two field strengths or their derivatives. Finally, we perform further field redefinition to rewrite the remaining couplings in a canonical form characterized by 85 independent couplings.</description>

      <title>Towards tree Yang-Mills and Yang-Mills-scalar amplitudes with higher-derivative interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent works, a new approach for constructing tree amplitudes, based on exploiting soft behaviors, was proposed. In this paper, we extend this approach to effective theories for gluons which incorporate higher-derivative interactions. By applying our method, we construct tree Yang-Mills (YM) and Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) amplitudes with the single insertion of $F^3$ local operator, as well as the YM amplitudes those receive contributions from both $F^3$ and $F^4$ operators. All results are represented as universal expansions to appropriate basis. We also conjecture a compact general formula for tree YM amplitudes with higher mass dimension, which allows us to generate them from ordinary YM amplitudes, and discuss the consistent factorizations of the conjectured formula.</description>

      <title>Holographic image features of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic image of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity. The AdS boundary hosts a Gaussian oscillation source, which induces a lensed response on the opposite side of the boundary during propagation through bulk spacetime. The optical system assists observers at the north pole to continuously capture holographic images that show an axisymmetric bright ring known as the Einstein ring. As the observation position shifted, the bright ring gradually transformed into a luminous arc and eventually transitioned into a light point. Simultaneously, we examine the impact of variations in relevant physical quantity on the ring, and present the corresponding brightness curve. The results indicate that as the temperature $T$ and nonlinear Yang Mills charge parameter $q$ increase, the ring radius also increases, while an increase in the chemical potential $u$ leads to a decrease. However, the peak brightness curve of the ring invariably decreases as the values of $T$, $u$, and $q$ increase, albeit to varying degrees. Upon comparing the outcomes of geometric optics, it can be observed that the position of the ring in holography images is consistent with that of the photon sphere.</description>

      <title>A dynamical implementation of canonical second quantization on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop theoretical methods for the implementation of creation and destruction operators in separate registers of a quantum computer, allowing for a transparent and dynamical creation and destruction of particle modes in second quantization in problems with variable particle number. We establish theorems for the commutation (anticommutation) relations on a finite memory bank and provide the needed symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing operators. Finally, we provide formulae in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify $n$ particles with $N_p$ modes each is of order $n\log_2 N_p$. Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires $O(N_p)$ qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each). And although less efficient, it is also less cumbersome than compact encoding.</description>

      <title>Effective short distance interaction in Calogero-Sutherland quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effective conformal field theory with symmetry W-infinity x W-infinity that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model. In the repulsive regime of the free fermion formulation, we identify an attractive interaction between opposite moving particle-hole pairs that dominates the short distance behavior and that is proposed as responsible for the destabilization of the ground state, leading to a new one of bosonic nature. The process is described by a Bogoliubov transformation of the free fermion bilinear operators into bosonic ones, preserving the form of the W-infinity algebra but decoupling the opposite chirality terms in the hamiltonian, as expected in the low energy limit. In coordinate space this interaction has a short range component that arises due to the quantum regularization of the theory. The described dynamical process may be considered as a mechanism of the emergence of the known charge and quantum statistics fractionalization of the low lying excitations of the theory, as predicted in both first and second quantization studies.</description>

      <title>Matter coupled to 3d Quantum Gravity: One-loop Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expect quantum field theories for matter to acquire intricate corrections due to their coupling to quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. This can be precisely worked out in 3d quantum gravity: after integrating out quantum gravity, matter fields are effectively described as noncommutative quantum field theories, with quantum-deformed Lorentz symmetries. An open question remains: Are such theories unitary or not? On the one hand, since these are effective field theories obtained after integrating out high energy degrees of freedom, we may expect the loss of unitarity. On the other hand, as rigorously defined field theories built with Lorentz symmetries and standing on their own, we naturally expect the conservation of unitarity. In an effort to settle this issue, we explicitly check unitarity for a scalar field at one-loop level in both Euclidean and Lorentzian space-time signatures. We find that unitarity requires adding an extra-term to the propagator of the noncommutative theory, corresponding to a massless mode and given by a representation with vanishing Plancherel measure, thus usually ignored in spinfoam path integrals for quantum gravity. This indicates that the inclusion of matter in spinfoam models, and more generally in quantum gravity, might be more subtle than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Holographic drag force with translational symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to investigate how the drag force is affected by translational symmetry breaking (TSB), we utilize a holographic model in which the background metric remains translational symmetric while a graviton mass or other fields in the theory break this symmetry. We calculate analytically the drag force, considering an asymptotic AdS$_5$ in which parameter $\alpha$ arises from TSB. This parameter can be intuitively understood as a measure of TSB strength and we anticipate that non-zero values of it will affect the drag force. In this asymptotic AdS$_5$ background, we will demonstrate that a decrease in $\alpha$ results in a reduction of the drag force. Moreover, we study the diffusion constant, which falls with increasing $\alpha$. It will eventually be shown that at lower values of $\alpha$ or $\mu$ (chemical potential), the transverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal one, and the speed of the heavy quark has minimal impact on the ratio.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing massless fields with fluxes in Landau-Ginzburg models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on flux compactifications suggests that the tadpole constraint generically allows only a limited number of complex structure moduli to become massive, i.e., be stabilized at quadratic order in the spacetime superpotential. We study the effects of higher-order terms systematically around the Fermat point in the $1^9$ Landau-Ginzburg model. This model lives at strong coupling and features no K\"ahler moduli. We show that, depending on the flux, several massless fields can indeed be stabilized in this fashion, and argue that this paves the way to explicit ${\mathcal N}=1$ Minkowski vacua without flat directions. Along the way, we complete the classification of integral flux vectors with small tadpole contribution. Thereby we are closing in on a future complete understanding of all possible flux configurations in the $1^9$ Landau-Ginzburg model.</description>

Abstract: We study topological defect lines in the symmetric-product orbifolds $\mathrm{Sym}^N(X)$ for a generic seed CFT $X$. We focus on the defects which preserve the maximum of the $S_N$ symmetry. When $X$ is taken to describe the free theory of four fermions and four bosons on a $\mathbb{T}^4$, we construct holographically dual backgrounds describing propagation of tensionless closed strings in the presence of spacetime defects wrapping the conformal boundary. We find a precise match between the spectra of local on-shell closed-string vertex operators in the bulk and the spectra of non-local disorder fields in the spacetime theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the action of the free quantum Hamiltonian in the Schr\"odinger representation on functional spaces generated by Gaussian states with boundary conditions set by localized external sources. It turns out that inspite of very general initial assumptions the proposed scheme requires at least two sources at a distance limited by non-zero constant of the model. In this way we provide example of quntum field evolved by the action of the free Hamiltonian confining external sources which set boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasi-fragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function (FF) where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan (DLY) result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics (QCD2) in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>Higher-order corrections to phase-transition parameters in dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of phase transitions (PT) in quantum field theories at finite temperature is most accurately described within the framework of dimensional reduction. In this framework, thermodynamic quantities are computed within the 3-dimensional effective field theory (EFT) that results from integrating out the high-temperature Matsubara modes. However, strong-enough PTs, observable in gravitational wave (GW) detectors, occur often nearby the limit of validity of the EFT, where effective operators can no longer be neglected. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of these interactions on the determination of PT parameters. We find that they allow for strong PTs in a wider region of parameter space, and that both the peak frequency and the amplitude of the resulting GW power spectrum can change by more than one order of magnitude when they are included. As a byproduct of this work, we derive equations for computing the bounce solution in the presence of higher-derivative terms, consistently with the EFT power counting.</description>

Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective Lagrangian of itinerant electron system of finite density at finite magnetic field is found to include Chern-Simons term of electromagnetic potentials of lower scale dimension than those studied before. This term has an origin in many-body wave function and unique topological property that is independent of a spin degree of freedom. The coupling strength is proportional to $\frac{\rho}{eB}$, which is singular at $B=0$ for a constant charge density. The effective Lagrangian at a finite $B$ represents physical effects at $ B \neq 0$ properly. A universal shift of the magnetic field known as Slater-Pauling curve is derived from the effective Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in a Polymer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the presence of an area gap, different than zero, affects the gravitational collapse of a dust ball. The implementation of such discreteness is achieved through the framework of polymer quantization, a scheme inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG). We study the collapse using variables which represent the area, in order to impose the non-zero area gap condition. The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical Oppenheimer-Snyder models. In both scenarios the formation of the singularity is avoided, due to the inversion of the velocity at finite values of the sphere surface. This happens due to the presence of a negative pressure, with origins at a quantum level. When the inversion happens inside the black hole event horizon, we achieve a geometry transition to a white hole. When the inversion happens outside the event horizon, we find a new possible astrophysical object. A characterization of such hypothetical object is done. Some constraints on the value for the area gap are also imposed in order to maintain the link with our already established physical theories.</description>

Abstract: We derive a systematic construction for form factors of relevant fields in the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising model, an integrable model with scattering amplitudes described by the $E_7$ bootstrap. We find a new type of recursive structure encoding the information in the bound state fusion structure, which fully determines the form factors of the perturbing field and the order/disorder fields, for which we present a mathematical proof. Knowledge of these form factors enables the systematic computation of correlation functions and dynamical structure factors in systems whose dynamics is governed by the vicinity of a fixed point in the tricritical Ising universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work a rotating SU(2) gluon system have been studied with the dyon ensemble in dilute limit. By solving the rotation-modified Yang-Mills equation we have obtained rotational corrections to the so-called dyon solutions with arbitrary centers to $\mathcal{O}(\omega^2)$ order and the corresponding semi-classical potential. The radial position dependent deconfinement temperature have been obtained by minimizing the semi-classical potential in both real and imaginary angular velocity cases. Although without the $\omega$-dependent coupling constant the critical temperature behaves different from the lattice simulation at each radial position as the rotation goes faster, its radial dependence is qualitatively the same as the lattice. That is in the real velocity case the outer layer will deconfine more difficult while the reverse is true in the imaginary velocity case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analytical investigation of the bound and unbound motion of magnetized particles orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, which includes all conceivable types of bounded and unbounded orbits. In particular, for planetary orbits, we perform a comparative analysis of our findings with the observed position of the S2 star carrying magnetic dipole moment around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We found maximum and minimum values for the parameter of magnetic interaction between the magnetic dipole of the star and the external magnetic field, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the S2 star. As a result, we obtain estimations of the magnetic dipole of the star in order of $10^6 \rm \ G\cdot cm^{3}$. Additionally, we explore deflecting trajectories akin to gravitational Rutherford scattering. In obtaining the solutions for the orbital equations, we articulate the elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions, and our study is augmented by illustrative figures and simulations.</description>

Abstract: Anti-de Sitter vacuum, which correspond to a negative cosmological constant (CC), is theoretically important and well-motivated. It is interesting to see whether current data can allow the existence of a negative CC not. In this paper, we perform the MCMC analysis for the $w_0w_a$CDM+CC model using recent DESI BAO measurements combined with Planck CMB and Pantheon Plus dataset. The results reveal that the bestfit energy density of CC is $\Omega_\Lambda\sim -0.3$ and the fitting to DESI is slightly improved, while $\Omega_\Lambda=0$ is also $1\sigma$ consistent.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks readily learn a subset of the modular arithmetic tasks, while failing to generalize on the rest. This limitation remains unmoved by the choice of architecture and training strategies. On the other hand, an analytical solution for the weights of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) networks that generalize on the modular addition task is known in the literature. In this work, we (i) extend the class of analytical solutions to include modular multiplication as well as modular addition with many terms. Additionally, we show that real networks trained on these datasets learn similar solutions upon generalization (grokking). (ii) We combine these "expert" solutions to construct networks that generalize on arbitrary modular polynomials. (iii) We hypothesize a classification of modular polynomials into learnable and non-learnable via neural networks training; and provide experimental evidence supporting our claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum states of black hole responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are given by a thin shell of Bell particles located at the region just underneath the horizon. We argue that the configuration can be stabilized by a new kind of degeneracy pressure which is suggested by a noncommutative geometry in the interior of the black hole. Black hole singularity is avoided. We utilize the work of Parikh and Wilczek \cite{Parikh:1999mf} to include the effect of tunneling on the Bell particles. We show that partially tunneled Bell particles give the Page curve of Hawking radiation, and the entirety of information initially stored in the black hole is returned to the outside via the Hawking radiation. In view of entropic force, the location of these Bell states is naturally related to the island and the quantum extremal surface.</description>

Abstract: Feynman integrals are solutions to linear partial differential equations with polynomial coefficients. Using a triangle integral with general exponents as a case in point, we compare $D$-module methods to dedicated methods developed for solving differential equations appearing in the context of Feynman integrals, and provide a dictionary of the relevant concepts. In particular, we implement an algorithm due to Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama to derive canonical series solutions of regular holonomic $D$-ideals, and compare them to asymptotic series derived by the respective Fuchsian systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we calculate matrix of modular transformations of the one-point toric conformal blocks in the Neveu-Schwarz sector of $N=1$ super Liouville field theory. For this purpose we use explicit expression for this matrix as integral of product of certain elements of fusion matrix. This integral is computed using the chain of integral identities for supersymmetric hyperbolic gamma functions derived by the degeneration of the integrals of parafermionic elliptic gamma functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac self-force of point-like particles is generalized within an effective field theory setup to include linear spin and susceptibility effects described perturbatively, in that setup, by effective couplings in the action. Electromagnetic self-interactions of the point-like particle are integrated out using the in-in supersymmetric worldline quantum field theory formalism. Divergences are regularized with dimensional regularization and the resulting equations of motion are in terms only of an external electromagnetic field and the particle degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature for metric spaces: Defining curvature for Quantum Gravity without coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrical properties of spacetime are difficult to study in nonperturbative approaches to quantum gravity like Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT), where one uses simplicial manifolds to define the gravitational path integral, instead of Riemannian manifolds. In particular, in CDT one only relies on two mathematical tools, a distance measure and a volume measure. In this paper, we define a notion of scalar curvature, for metric spaces endowed with a volume measure or a random walk, without assuming nor using notions of tensor calculus. Furthermore, we directly define the Ricci scalar, without the need of defining and computing the Riemann or the Ricci tensor a priori. For this, we make use of quantities, like the surface of a geodesic sphere, or the return probability of scalar diffusion processes, that can be computed in these metric spaces, as in a Riemannian manifold, where they receive scalar curvature contributions. Our definitions recover the classical results of scalar curvature when the sets are Riemannian manifolds. We propose seven methods to compute the scalar curvature in these spaces, and we compare their features in natural implementations in discrete spaces. The defined generalized scalar curvatures are easily implemented on discrete spaces, like graphs. We present the results of our definitions on random triangulations of a 2D sphere and plane. Additionally, we show the results of our generalized scalar curvatures on the quantum geometries of 2D CDT, where we find that all our definitions indicate a flat ground state of the gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet Formalism for Decoupling Limits in String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bosonic sector of a decoupling limit of type IIA superstring theory, where a background Ramond-Ramond one-form is fined tuned to its critical value, such that it cancels the associated background D0-brane tension. The light excitations in this critical limit are D0-branes, whose dynamics is described by the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) Matrix theory that corresponds to M-theory in the Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ). We develop the worldsheet formalism for the fundamental string in the same critical limit of type IIA superstring theory. We show that the fundamental string develops singularities on its worldsheet, whose topology is described by nodal Riemann spheres as in ambitwistor string theory. We study the T-duality transformations of this string sigma model and provide a worldsheet derivation for the recently revived and expanded duality web that unifies a zoo of decoupling limits in type II superstring theories. By matching the string worldsheet actions, we demonstrate how some of these decoupling limits are related to tensionless (and ambitwistor) string theory, Carrollian string theory, the Spin Matrix limits of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the adiabatic tidal contributions to the radiation reacted momentum impulse $\Delta p_i^\mu$ and scattering angle $\theta$ between two scattered massive bodies (neutron stars) at next-to-next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order. The state-of-the-art three-loop (4PM) worldline quantum field theory toolkit using dimensional regularization is employed to establish the classical observables. We encounter divergent terms in the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic quadrupolar sectors necessitating the addition of post-adiabatic counterterms in this classical theory. This leads us to include also the leading post-adiabatic tidal contributions to the observables. The resulting renormalization group flow of the associated post-adiabatic Love numbers is established and shown to agree with a recent gravito-electric third post-Newtonian analysis in the non-relativistic limit.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $T\bar{T}$ deformation on non-Hermitian coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the holographic picture. The relationship between ground state and thermofield double state is preserved under the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We prove that $T\bar{T}$ deformed theory provides a reparameterization in large $N$ limit. These deformation effects is calculated numerically with green functions and free energy. The thermodynamic phase structures show the equivalence of the wormhole-black hole picture between non-Hermitian model and Hermitian model still holds under $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We also study the correlation function in Lorentz time and revival dynamic.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Veneziano and Shapiro-Virasoro amplitudes to four arbitrarily excited states in bosonic string theory. We use the formalism of coherent string states based on the Di Vecchia-Del Giudice-Fubini construction. Within the same formalism, we also analyze the three string scattering finding the covariant version of the three reggeon interaction. Then studying the factorization properties of the extended four string scattering amplitudes we identify the covariant version of the three string interaction. Finally we obtain generalized Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations connecting the scattering of four open and closed arbitrarily excited states.</description>

Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the causal structure of the bulk AdS spacetime is tied to entanglement in the dual CFT. This relationship is captured by the connected wedge theorem, which states that a bulk scattering process implies the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ entanglement between associated boundary subregions. In this paper, we study the connected wedge theorem in two asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes: the conical defect and BTZ black hole geometries. In these settings, we find that bulk scattering processes require not just large entanglement, but also additional restrictions related to candidate RT surfaces which are non-minimal. We argue these extra relationships imply a certain CFT entanglement structure involving internal degrees of freedom. Because bulk scattering relies on sub-AdS scale physics, this supports the idea that sub-AdS scale locality emerges from internal degrees of freedom. While the new restriction that we identify on non-minimal surfaces is stronger than the initial statement of the connected wedge theorem, we find that it is necessary but still not sufficient to imply bulk scattering in mixed states.</description>

Abstract: We construct the generalized $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed partition functions through $W$ representations, where the expansions are respectively with respect to the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials labeled by $N$-tuple of Young diagrams. We find that there are the profound interrelations between our deformed partition functions and the $4d$ and $5d$ Nekrasov partition functions. Since the corresponding Nekrasov partition functions can be given by vertex operators, the remarkable connection between our $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed $W$-operators and vertex operators is revealed in this paper. In addition, we investigate the higher Hamiltonians for the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes and Entanglement Islands in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Karch-Randall braneworld provides a natural set-up to study the Hawking radiation from a black hole using holographic tools. Such a black hole lives on a brane and is highly quantum yet has a holographic dual as a higher dimensional classical theory that lives in the ambient space. Moreover, such a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath which is absorbing its Hawking radiation. This allows us to compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation by studying the bath using the quantum extremal surface prescription. The quantum extremal surface geometrizes into a Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the ambient space. The topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in time from connecting different portions of the bath to the one connecting the bath and the brane gives the Page curve of the Hawking radiation that is consistent with unitarity. Nevertheless, there doesn't exit a derivation of the quantum extremal surface prescription and its geometrization in the Karch-Randall braneworld. In this paper, we fill this gap. We mainly focus on the case that the ambient space is (2+1)-dimensional for which explicit computations can be done in each description of the set-up. We show that the topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponds to the formation of the replica wormhole on the Karch-Randall brane as the dominate contribution to the replica path integral. For higher dimensional situations, we show that the geometry of the brane satisfies Einstein's equation coupled with conformal matter. We comment on possible implications to the general rule of gravitational path integral from this equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the holographic method, we investigate correlation functions of boundary and defect conformal field theories. To describe boundary conformal field theory, we consider an end of the world brane in an asymptotic AdS space which behaves as a boundary in the dual conformal field theory. In this holographic setup, we calculate correlation functions involving the reflection effect at the boundary. We show that, when the end of the world brane has no degrees of freedom, the holographic calculation reproduces the correlation functions known in the boundary conformal field theory. When the boundary has nontrivial boundary entropy, we calculate one- and two-point functions nontrivially relying on the boundary entropy. We further study correlation functions of defect conformal field theory after introducing a $p$-brane. We directly derive a bulk-to-defect two-point function without introducing an image operator and determine the coefficient of the two-point function exactly in the holographic setup.</description>

Abstract: We study the (ambi-)twistor model for spinning particles interacting via electromagnetic field, as a toy model for studying classical dynamics of gravitating bodies including effects of both spins to all orders. We compute the momentum kick and spin kick up to one-loop order and show precisely how they are encoded in the classical eikonal. The all-orders-in-spin effects are encoded as a dynamical implementation of the Newman-Janis shift, and we find that the expansion in both spins can be resummed to simple expressions in special kinematic configurations, at least up to one-loop order. We confirm that the classical eikonal can be understood as the generator of canonical transformations that map the in-states of a scattering process to the out-states. We also remark that cut contributions for converting worldline propagators from time-symmetric to retarded amount to the iterated action of the leading eikonal at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Branch Operator Algebras and Universal Selection Rules for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb branches of vacua are the most universal moduli spaces that arise in local unitary interacting 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs). In these theories, $1/2$-BPS primaries parameterize the Coulomb branches and form (anti-)chiral rings. We define the notion of a Coulomb branch operator algebra, $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{C}}$, that contains these chiral and anti-chiral rings along with infinitely many more operators and products that are less protected by supersymmetry. Using a universal symmetry, $\mathcal{I}\cong\mathbb{Z}_2$, that arises from studying the superconformal group, we give $\mathcal{I}$ selection rules for $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{C}}$ and, more generally, for arbitrary products in the local operator algebra of any 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT. Defining the notion of a "Coulombic" SCFT, we propose explanations for certain phenomena in a 4d/2d correspondence involving 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and 2d vertex operator algebras. Finally, by considering deformations of $\mathcal{I}$, we explore the case of $\mathcal{N}&gt;2$ SCFTs.</description>

Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in semiclassical quantum gravity for cosmological backgrounds, focusing on two key examples: slow-roll inflation and evaporating Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes. In both cases, we demonstrate the existence of a nontrivial algebra of diffeomorphism-invariant observables \emph{without} the introduction of an external clock system or the presence of any asymptotic gravitational charges. Instead, the rolling inflaton field and the evaporating black hole act as physical clocks that allow a definition of gauge-invariant observables at $G = 0$. The resulting algebras are both Type II$_\infty$ factors, but neither is manifestly a crossed product algebra. We establish a connection between the Type II entropy of these algebras and generalized entropies for appropriate states. Our work extends previous results on Type II gravitational algebras and highlights the crucial role of out-of-equilibrium dynamics for defining gauge-invariant observables in semiclassical canonically quantised gravity. We also briefly discuss the construction of gauge-invariant algebras for compact wedges bounded by extremal surfaces in generic spacetimes (i.e. in the absence of any Killing symmetry). In contrast to the inflaton and black hole cases, this algebra does end up being a simple crossed product. No clock or asymptotic charges are required because of the absence of any symmetry in the classical background.</description>

Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

Abstract: A discrete formulation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a functional of paths with respect to a complex probability on a sample space of discrete valued paths is explored. The formulation in terms of complex probabilities is motivated by a recent reinterpretation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a potential functional with respect to a complex probability distribution on cylinder sets of paths. The discrete formulation in this work is based on a discrete version of Weyl algebra that can be applied to any observable with a finite number of outcomes. The origin of the complex probability in this work is the completeness relation. In the discrete formulation the complex probability exactly factors into products of conditional probabilities and exact unitarity is maintained at each level of approximation. The approximation of infinite dimensional quantum systems by discrete systems is discussed. Applications to scattering theory and quantum field theory are illustrated.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>

Abstract: Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.</description>

      <title>Energy conditions in the $f(R,L,T)$ theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the energy conditions for the recently proposed $f(R,L,T)$ gravity theory, for which $f$ is a generic function of the Ricci scalar $R$, matter lagrangian density $L$ and trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We analyse two different forms for the $f(R,L,T)$ function within the framework of the Friedmann-Lem\^aitre-Robertson-Walker universe. We constrain the model parameters from the energy conditions. This approach allows us to assess the feasibility of specific forms of the $f(R,L,T)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Massive Scalar Field Perturbations of Black Holes Immersed in Chaplygin-Like Dark Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider massive scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), and we analyze the photon sphere modes, the de Sitter modes as well as the near extremal modes and discuss their dominance, by using the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We also discuss the impact of the parameter representing the intensity of the CDF on the families of quasinormal modes. Mainly, we find that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background, and it is characterized by quasinormal frequencies with a smaller oscillation frequency and a longer decay time compared to the propagation of the same massive scalar field within the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics in Krylov Space: Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide a compact and computationally efficient description of quantum evolution, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dynamics of a charged spinning body in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the motion of the spinning body (in the pole-dipole approximation) in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon-Souriau equations. First, we define a novel spin supplementary condition for the electromagnetic interactions which generalizes the one proposed by Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\'ak for gravity. As a result, we get the whole family of charged spinning particle models in the curved spacetime with remarkably simple dynamics (momentum and velocity are parallel). Applying the reparametrization procedure, for a specific dipole moment, we obtain equations of motion with constant mass and gyromagnetic factor. Next, we show that these equations follows from an effective Hamiltonian formalism, previously interpreted as a classical model of the charged Dirac particle.</description>
