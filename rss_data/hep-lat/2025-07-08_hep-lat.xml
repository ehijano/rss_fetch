      <title>An Enthalpy-Based Unified Lattice Boltzmann Flux Solver for Liquid Solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enthalpy-based uniform lattice Boltzmann flux solver (EULBFS) is proposed in this paper for simulating liquid solidification, incorporating the effects of volume expansion and shrinkage caused by density differences between liquid and solid phases. The proposed solver first establishes the relationships between the macroscopic governing equations and mesoscopic formal equations that describe the temperature, flow, and phase fields. The macroscopic governing equations are then discretized by the finite volume method (FVM), with the corresponding fluxes calculated based on the established relationships. In this way, it enables a unified and coherent solution framework for all fields. In contrast to the conventional lattice Boltzmann methods, the present approach handles additional terms directly via finite volume discretization, offering a more straightforward and flexible formulation. Furthermore, the use of the total enthalpy equation to couple the temperature field with the phase fraction allows for efficient modeling of phase change processes, significantly reducing the computational complexity associated with interface tracking. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed solver are demonstrated by a series of benchmark tests, including the conductive freezing problem, the three-phase Stefan problem, the freezing of a liquid film in a two-dimensional container, the solidification of a static droplet on a cold surface, and the freezing of a droplet upon impact with a cold surface.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ Form Factors with the Heavy Quark Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent publications by three lattice QCD collaborations have provided an unprecedented wealth of theoretical predictions for the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors, for spectator flavours $q=u/d$ and $q=s$. We analyse these predictions within the framework of the heavy-quark expansion (HQE) to order $\alpha_s$, $1/m_b$, and $1/m_c^2$. For the first time, our analysis imposes unitarity bounds for all of the $\bar{B}_q^{(*)} \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors; this includes newly identified tensor form factors arising in $\bar{B}_q^*\to D_q^{(*)}$. This enables us to treat all form factors in the same fashion. At the level of our present analysis, the inclusion of the tensor bounds is not yet constraining the HQE parameter space. We find the lattice QCD results to be well compatible with each other in a joint HQE fit as well as with QCD sum rule estimates that were used in previous HQE analyses. This is in contrast to the strong variability of the posterior predictions, in particular of the form factors ratios $R_0$ and $R_2$. Using the posterior distributions of our HQE analysis, we provide predictions for angular observables and LFU ratios in the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}\ell^-\bar{\nu}$ decays.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ from lattice QCD: Long-distance and full light-quark connected contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for the dominant light-quark connected contribution to the long-distance window (LD) of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution (HVP) to the muon $g-2$ from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, with a new determination of the lattice scale on MILC's physical-mass HISQ ensembles, using the $\Omega^-$ baryon mass, we obtain a result of $400.2(2.3)_{\mathrm{stat}}(3.7)_{\mathrm{syst}}[4.3]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. Summing this result with our recent determinations of the light-quark connected contributions to the short- (SD) and intermediate-distance (W) windows, we obtain a sub-percent precision determination of the light-quark-connected contribution to HVP of $655.5(2.3)_{\mathrm{stat}}(3.9)_{\mathrm{syst}}[4.5]_{\mathrm{total}} \times 10^{-10}$. Finally, as a consistency check, we verify that an independent analysis of the full contribution is in agreement with the sum of individual windows. We discuss our future plans for improvements of our HVP calculations to meet the target precision of the Fermilab $g-2$ experiment.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term $\chi$ is not zero, although largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ($\tau$) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also much suppressed. The bosonic definition of the topological charge $Q_t$ and its Abelian counterpart $Q_a\equiv (g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4x \Tr(f_{\mu\nu}f_{\mu\nu}^*)$ written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When $\chi$ is zero, $Q_a$=3$Q_t$ is expected theoretically, but a simple lattice definition of $Q_a$ is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG, when $Q_t$ is around -1.</description>

      <title>QCD predictions for physical multimeson scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>$\Xi_c \to \Xi$ form factors from lattice QCD with domain-wall quarks: A new piece in the puzzle of $\Xi_c^0$ decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD determination of the vector and axial-vector form factors that describe the charm-baryon semileptonic decays $\Xi_c\to \Xi \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. The calculation uses a domain-wall action for the up, down, and strange quarks, and an anisotropic clover action for the charm quark. We use four ensembles of gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, with lattice spacings between 0.111 and 0.073 fm and pion masses ranging from 420 to 230 MeV. We present Standard-Model predictions for the decay rates and branching fractions of $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi_c^-\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ and $\Xi_c^+\to\Xi_c^0\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ for $\ell=e,\mu$. In particular, we obtain $\Gamma(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e)/|V_{cs}|^2 = 0.2515(73)\text{ ps}^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e) = 3.58(12)\:\%$. These values are higher than those predicted by a previous lattice calculation and substantially higher than the experimentally measured values, but consistent with expectations from approximate $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization using a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, R\'enyi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Determination of Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Being closely connected to the origin of the nucleon mass, the gravitational form factors of the nucleon have attracted significant attention in recent years. We present the first model-independent determinations of the gravitational form factors of the pion and nucleon at the physical pion mass, using a data-driven dispersive approach. The so-called "last global unknown property" of the nucleon, the $D$-term, is determined to be $-3.38^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$. The root mean square radius of the scalar trace density inside the nucleon is determined to be $(0.97 \pm0.03)~\text{fm}$. Notably, this value is larger than the proton charge radius, suggesting a modern structural view of the nucleon where gluons, responsible for most of the nucleon mass, are distributed over a larger spatial region than quarks, which dominate the charge distribution, indicating that the radius of the trace density may be regarded as a confinement radius. We also predict the nucleon angular momentum and mechanical radii, providing further insights into the intricate internal structure of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>$K$-theoretic computation of the Atiyah(-Patodi)-Singer index of lattice Dirac operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory can be identified as a mathematical object in $K$-theory and that its associated spectral flow is equal to the index. In comparison to the standard lattice Dirac operator index, our formulation does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and has broader applicability to systems with boundaries and to the mod-two version of the indices in general dimensions. We numerically verify that the $K$ and $KO$ group formulas reproduce the known index theorems in continuum theory. We examine the Atiyah-Singer index on a flat two-dimensional torus and, for the first time, demonstrate that the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index with nontrivial curved boundaries, as well as the mod-two versions, can be computed on a lattice.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>
