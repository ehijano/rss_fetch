      <title>Verifying The Radiosonde Humidity Sensor Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17335v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the performance of humidity sensors has become particularly relevant due to the lack of in-house production of humidity sensors in the Russian Federation and the logistical problems that have arisen. Humidity is subject to high spatial variability, therefore, standard methods for monitoring data quality based on the difference with the field of the first approximation are not applicable for its control. It is proposed to carry out monitoring by comparing readings on the surface and at altitude with a pressure of 850 hPa, where humidity is less than 60% in the absence of low clouds, and more than 70% in its presence. The fact of the presence/absence of low clouds is determined by the readings of a vertically oriented pyrometer. The difference between the air temperature at the surface and the temperature from the pyrometer of more than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the absence of low clouds, and less than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the presence of low clouds. Accordingly, a serviceable humidity sensor should show the appropriate values.</description>

      <title>Wave-induced biases in ADCP measurements from quasi-Lagrangian platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact autonomous marine vehicles, both surface and submersible, are now commonly used to conduct observations of ocean velocities using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs). However, in the inevitable presence of surface waves, ADCP measurements conducted by these platforms are susceptible to biases stemming from wave-coherent orbital motion and platform tilting. In typical ocean conditions, the magnitude of the bias can reach tens of centimeters per second. This paper presents analytical derivation of the depth-dependent bias formulas in the small-amplitude linear wave approximation. A variety of scenarios are considered, encompassing surface and subsurface platforms, upward- and downward-looking ADCPs, free-drifting and self-propelled vehicles. The bias is shown to be a function of the wave field properties, platform response dynamics, and the ADCP configuration (particularly, orientation and beam angle). In all cases, the wave-induced biases show parametric scaling similar to that of the Stokes drift, albeit with a number of critical nuances. Analytical derivations are validated with a semi-analytical model, which can also be used to estimate the biases for more complex measurement configurations and fully nonlinear waves. Further analysis reveals unexpected fundamental differences between the upward- and downward-looking ADCP configurations, offering insights for experimental design aimed at minimizing and mitigating wave-induced biases in autonomous oceanographic observations.</description>

      <title>Earth ECS Upper Limit using Modified Energy Budget Methods and Trend Analyses v.3b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11869v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth global and regional effective thermal "conductance" G(eff) (in (W/m^2)/C and often labeled lambda in climate research) and the related Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) are evaluated by applying a modified version of the Energy Budget method, and using data only after 1970. By removing Periodic Interfering temperature components (using a novel PIR process) and applying high frequency filtering, an extraordinarily near linear temperature response is revealed, enhancing accurate G(eff) calculation and avoiding the pre-1970 aerosol forcing and ocean energy per area (E*) absorption uncertainties. A formal/empirical method is used to determine more reliable values of Q(t)=d[E*(Ocean.energy)]/dt . Using NOAA data, and after PIR, it is shown that: 1) The Energy Budget Method can be realistically applied to the Ocean and Land regions independently, 2) the effective volcanic forcing is &lt;= 1/5 the IPCC AR5 estimate, 3) the "historical" 1980-2020 ECS(eff) values for Global, global Ocean, and global Land regions values are &lt;= 2.16, 1.69, 2.96 C/2xCO2 respectively; where the updated IPCC AR5 orthodox independent global Forcing value of 0.4 (W/m^2)/Decade and F/2xCO2= 3.7 W/m^2 were used. Uncertainty is about 10%. The Global average ECS(true) value of &lt;= 2.10 C is 70% of the IPCC AR6 ECS estimate of 3.0 C, but 127% of the ECS(eff) value reported by Lewis (1.66 C). The estimated oceans average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.71 and the global average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.83, and ECS(land)/ECS(Ocean) = 1.78 . [Results using HADCRUT temperature data instead are similar, but 6% "cooler" over land, and 8% "warmer" over oceans.] A simplified physically realistic formal/empirical Coarse 2-D Global Climate Model is derived wherein variation of Geff(t) until equilibrium (i.e. "pattern effects") are proven to be negligible or "cooling", using these Methods. And so it is likely ECS(true)&lt;= ECS(eff).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I describe in this paper how the shallow water waves of Airy, produced by submarine earthquake, gentle on a deep open sea traveling by the cruising speed, get instantaneous $ +\infty$ or $-\infty$ traveling speed in approaching the shallow water near the coasts at the points of the surface on x=X, near the crest or the trough, where the tangent of itself and the tangent of the seabed coincide, rushing as inland tunamis ( near the crest) or as offshore tunamis (near the trough).</description>

      <title>AI-based climate model evaluation through the lens of heatwave storylines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based weather and climate models are emerging as accurate and computationally efficient tools. Beyond weather forecasting, they also show promise to accelerate storyline analyses. We rigorously evaluate NeuralGCM's ability to reproduce an extreme heatwave against physics-based climate model. NeuralGCM accurately replicates the targeted event, and generates stable and realistic mid-century projections. However, due to the absence of land feedbacks, NeuralGCM underestimates the projected warming amplitude compared to physics-based model benchmarks.</description>
