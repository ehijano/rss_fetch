      <title>Energy Efficient Transmission Parameters Selection Method Using Reinforcement Learning in Distributed LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increase in demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the number of IoT devices has drastically grown, making spectrum resources seriously insufficient. Transmission collisions and retransmissions increase power consumption. Therefore, even in long-range (LoRa) networks, selecting appropriate transmission parameters, such as channel and transmission power, is essential to improve energy efficiency. However, due to the limited computational ability and memory, traditional transmission parameter selection methods for LoRa networks are challenging to implement on LoRa devices. To solve this problem, a distributed reinforcement learning-based channel and transmission power selection method is proposed, which can be implemented on the LoRa devices to improve energy efficiency in this paper. Specifically, the channel and transmission power selection problem in LoRa networks is first mapped to the multi-armed-bandit (MAB) problem. Then, an MAB-based method is introduced to solve the formulated transmission parameter selection problem based on the acknowledgment (ACK) packet and the power consumption for data transmission of the LoRa device. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the constructed actual LoRa network. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than fixed assignment, adaptive data rate low-complexity (ADR-Lite), and $\epsilon$-greedy-based methods in terms of both transmission success rate and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Demo: Testing AI-driven MAC Learning in Autonomic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G networks will be highly dynamic, re-configurable, and resilient. To enable and support such features, employing AI has been suggested. Integrating AIin networks will likely require distributed AI deployments with resilient connectivity, e.g., for communication between RL agents and environment. Such approaches need to be validated in realistic network environments. In this demo, we use ContainerNet to emulate AI-capable and autonomic networks that employ the routing protocol KIRA to provide resilient connectivity and service discovery. As an example AI application, we train and infer deep RL agents learning medium access control (MAC) policies for a wireless network environment in the emulated network.</description>

      <title>Exploring Content Concealment in Email</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The never-ending barrage of malicious emails, such as spam and phishing, is of constant concern for users, who rely on countermeasures such as email filters to keep the intended recipient safe. Modern email filters, one of our few defence mechanisms against malicious emails, are often circumvented by sophisticated attackers. This study focuses on how attackers exploit HTML and CSS in emails to conceal arbitrary content, allowing for multiple permutations of a malicious email, some of which may evade detection by email filters. This concealed content remains undetected by the recipient, presenting a serious security risk. Our research involved developing and applying an email sampling and analysis procedure to a large-scale dataset of unsolicited emails. We then identify the sub-types of concealment attackers use to conceal content and the HTML and CSS tricks employed.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Version Innovation Age for Monitoring Markovian Source in Energy-Harvesting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time remote tracking of a two-state Markov process by an energy harvesting source. The source decides whether to transmit over an unreliable channel based on the state. We formulate this scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP) to determine the optimal transmission policy that minimizes the average Version Innovation Age (VIA) as a performance metric. We demonstrate that the optimal transmission policy is threshold-based, determined by the battery level, source state, and VIA value. We numerically verify the analytical structure of the optimal policy and compare the performance of our proposed policy against two baseline policies across various system parameters, establishing the superior performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning framework for LoRaWAN-enabled IIoT communication: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of intelligent Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems promises to revolutionize operational and maintenance practices, driving improvements in operational efficiency. Anomaly detection within IIoT architectures plays a crucial role in preventive maintenance and spotting irregularities in industrial components. However, due to limited message and processing capacity, traditional Machine Learning (ML) faces challenges in deploying anomaly detection models in resource-constrained environments like LoRaWAN. On the other hand, Federated Learning (FL) solves this problem by enabling distributed model training, addressing privacy concerns, and minimizing data transmission. This study explores using FL for anomaly detection in industrial and civil construction machinery architectures that use IIoT prototypes with LoRaWAN communication. The process leverages an optimized autoencoder neural network structure and compares federated models with centralized ones. Despite uneven data distribution among machine clients, FL demonstrates effectiveness, with a mean F1 score (of 94.77), accuracy (of 92.30), TNR (of 90.65), and TPR (92.93), comparable to centralized models, considering airtime of trainning messages of 52.8 min. Local model evaluations on each machine highlight adaptability. At the same time, the performed analysis identifies message requirements, minimum training hours, and optimal round/epoch configurations for FL in LoRaWAN, guiding future implementations in constrained industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Socialized Learning: A Survey of the Paradigm Shift for Edge Intelligence in Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amidst the robust impetus from artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged as a nascent computing paradigm, synthesizing AI with edge computing (EC) to become an exemplary solution for unleashing the full potential of AI services. Nonetheless, challenges in communication costs, resource allocation, privacy, and security continue to constrain its proficiency in supporting services with diverse requirements. In response to these issues, this paper introduces socialized learning (SL) as a promising solution, further propelling the advancement of EI. SL is a learning paradigm predicated on social principles and behaviors, aimed at amplifying the collaborative capacity and collective intelligence of agents within the EI system. SL not only enhances the system's adaptability but also optimizes communication, and networking processes, essential for distributed intelligence across diverse devices and platforms. Therefore, a combination of SL and EI may greatly facilitate the development of collaborative intelligence in the future network. This paper presents the findings of a literature review on the integration of EI and SL, summarizing the latest achievements in existing research on EI and SL. Subsequently, we delve comprehensively into the limitations of EI and how it could benefit from SL. Special emphasis is placed on the communication challenges and networking strategies and other aspects within these systems, underlining the role of optimized network solutions in improving system efficiency. Based on these discussions, we elaborate in detail on three integrated components: socialized architecture, socialized training, and socialized inference, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we identify some possible future applications of combining SL and EI, discuss open problems and suggest some future research.</description>

      <title>Automatic Retrieval-augmented Generation of 6G Network Specifications for Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6G Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) promises to open data interfaces to enable plug-and-play service Apps, many of which are consumer and business-facing. Opening up 6G access lowers the barrier to innovation but raises the challenge that the required communication specifications are not fully known to all service designers. As such, business innovators must either be familiar with 6G standards or consult with experts. Enabling consistent, unbiased, rapid, and low-cost requirement assessment and specification generation is crucial to the O-RAN innovation ecosystem.
  Here, we discuss our initiative to bridge service specification gaps between network service providers and business innovators leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). We first review the state-of-the-art and motivation in 6G plug-and-play services, capabilities, potential use cases and LLMs. We identify an ample innovation space for hybrid use cases that may require diverse and variational wireless functionalities across its operating time. We show that the network specification can be automated and present the first automatic retrieval-augmented network service specification framework for 6G use cases. To enable public acceptance and feedback, a website interface is published for the research and industrial community to experiment with the framework. We hope this review highlights the need for emerging foundation models for this area and motivates researcher engagement and contribution to the community through our framework.</description>

      <title>JingZhao: A Framework for Rapid NIC Prototyping in the Domain-Specific-Network Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The network is becoming Domain-Specific, which requires on-demand design of the network protocols, as well as the microarchitecture of the NIC. However, to develop such a NIC is not that easy. Since the scissor gap between network speed and the growth of CPU frequency is expanding, most of the protocols need to be offloaded to hardware. The process of designing, verifying and optimizing a domain-specific NIC usually takes great effort, which hinders the rapid iteration of new protocols and algorithms. In this paper, we propose JingZhao, an open-sourced framework for NIC prototyping, which could be leveraged to rapidly implement a domain-specific NIC. JingZhao provides several building blocks, as well as a full-fledged RDMA NIC, to help rapidly prototype a high-performance NIC. Our evaluation results show that new network functions can be easily integrated into the framework, and achieve line-rate packet processing.</description>

      <title>Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>
