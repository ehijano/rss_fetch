      <title>Predictive Digital Twins with Quantified Uncertainty for Patient-Specific Decision Making in Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in predictive models is critical for establishing trust and enabling risk-informed decision making for personalized medicine. In contrast to one-size-fits-all approaches that seek to mitigate risk at the population level, digital twins enable personalized modeling thereby potentially improving individual patient outcomes. Realizing digital twins in biomedicine requires scalable and efficient methods to integrate patient data with mechanistic models of disease progression. This study develops an end-to-end data-to-decisions methodology that combines longitudinal non-invasive imaging data with mechanistic models to estimate and predict spatiotemporal tumor progression accounting for patient-specific anatomy. Through the solution of a statistical inverse problem, imaging data inform the spatially varying parameters of a reaction-diffusion model of tumor progression. An efficient parallel implementation of the forward model coupled with a scalable approximation of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables rigorous, but tractable, quantification of uncertainty due to the sparse, noisy measurements. The methodology is verified on a virtual patient with synthetic data to control for model inadequacy, noise level, and the frequency of data collection. The application to decision-making is illustrated by evaluating the importance of imaging frequency and formulating an optimal experimental design question. The clinical relevance is demonstrated through a model validation study on a cohort of patients with publicly available longitudinal imaging data.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the initial post-buckling response of trusses and frames by an asymptotic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic post-buckling theory is applied to sizing and topology optimization of trusses and frames, exploring its potential and current computational difficulties. We show that a designs' post-buckling response can be controlled by including the lowest two asymptotic coefficients, representing the initial post-buckling slope and curvature, in the optimization formulation. This also reduces the imperfection sensitivity of the optimized design. The asymptotic expansion can further be used to approximate the structural nonlinear response, and then to optimize for a given measure of the nonlinear mechanical performance such as, for example, end-compliance or complementary work. Examples of linear and nonlinear compliance minimization of trusses and frames show the effective use of the asymptotic method for including post-buckling constraints in structural optimization.</description>

      <title>Radon Exposure Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure to elevated radon levels in the home is one of the leading causes of lung cancer in the world. The following study describes the creation of a comprehensive, state-level dataset designed to enable the modeling and prediction of household radon concentrations at Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) and sub-kilometer scales. Details include the data collection and processing involved in compiling physical and demographic factors for Pennsylvania and Utah. Attempting to mitigate this risk requires identifying the underlying geological causes and the populations that might be at risk. This work focuses on identifying at-risk populations throughout Pennsylvania and Utah, where radon levels are some of the highest in the country. The resulting dataset harmonizes geological and demographic factors from various sources and spatial resolutions, including temperature, geochemistry, and soil characteristics. Demographic variables such as the household heating fuel used, the age of building, and the housing type provide further insight into which populations could be most susceptible in areas with potentially high radon levels. This dataset also serves as a foundational resource for two other studies conducted by the authors. The resolution of the data provides a novel approach to predicting potential radon exposure, and the data processing conducted for these states can be scaled up to larger spatial resolutions (e.g., the Contiguous United States [CONUS]) and allow for a broad reclassification of radon exposure potential in the United States.</description>

      <title>Deep-MacroFin: Informed Equilibrium Neural Network for Continuous Time Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Deep-MacroFin, a comprehensive framework designed to solve partial differential equations, with a particular focus on models in continuous time economics. This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and coupled algebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to other numerical methods. This framework can be readily adapted for systems of partial differential equations in high dimensions. Importantly, it offers a more efficient (5$\times$ less CUDA memory and 40$\times$ fewer FLOPs in 100D problems) and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries. We also incorporate a time-stepping scheme to enhance training stability for nonlinear HJB equations, enabling the solution of 50D economic models.</description>

      <title>Decoding Futures Price Dynamics: A Regularized Sparse Autoencoder for Interpretable Multi-Horizon Forecasting and Factor Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commodity price volatility creates economic challenges, necessitating accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices for commodities like copper and crude oil is complicated by diverse interacting factors (macroeconomic, supply/demand, geopolitical, etc.). Current models often lack transparency, limiting strategic use. This paper presents a Regularized Sparse Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework for simultaneous multi-horizon commodity price prediction and discovery of interpretable latent market drivers. The RSAE forecasts prices at multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week, 1-month) using multivariate time series. Crucially, L1 regularization ($\|\mathbf{z}\|_1$) on its latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ enforces sparsity, promoting parsimonious explanations of market dynamics through learned factors representing underlying drivers (e.g., demand, supply shocks). Drawing from energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE optimizes predictive accuracy while learning sparse representations. Evaluated on historical Copper and Crude Oil data with numerous indicators, our findings indicate the RSAE offers competitive multi-horizon forecasting accuracy and data-driven insights into price dynamics via its interpretable latent space, a key advantage over traditional black-box approaches.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 100 trillion grid points via information geometric regularization and the MFC flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a method and optimized implementation for exascale simulations of high-speed compressible fluid flows, enabling the simulation of multi-engine rocket craft at an unprecedented scale. We significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and memory footprint through a carefully crafted implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization, which eliminates the need for numerical shock capturing. Unified addressing on tightly coupled CPU--GPU platforms increases the total problem size with negligible performance hit. Despite linear stencil algorithms being memory-bound, we achieve wall clock times that are four times faster than optimized baseline numerics. This enables the execution of CFD simulations at more than 100 trillion grid points, surpassing the largest state-of-the-art publicly available simulations by an order of magnitude. Ideal weak scaling is demonstrated on OLCF Frontier and CSCS Alps using the full system, entailing 37.8K AMD MI250X GPUs (Frontier) or 9.2K NVIDIA GH200 superchips (Alps).</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators for Forward and Inverse Problems in Parametric Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametric differential equations of the form du/dt = f(u, x, t, p) are fundamental in science and engineering. While deep learning frameworks such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) can efficiently approximate solutions, they struggle with inverse problems, sensitivity estimation (du/dp), and concept drift. We address these limitations by introducing a sensitivity-based regularization strategy, called Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators (SC-FNO). SC-FNO achieves high accuracy in predicting solution paths and consistently outperforms standard FNO and FNO with physics-informed regularization. It improves performance in parameter inversion tasks, scales to high-dimensional parameter spaces (tested with up to 82 parameters), and reduces both data and training requirements. These gains are achieved with a modest increase in training time (30% to 130% per epoch) and generalize across various types of differential equations and neural operators.
