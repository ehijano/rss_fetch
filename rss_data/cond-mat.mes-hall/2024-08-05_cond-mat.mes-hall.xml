      <title>Analog Unruh effect of inhomogeneous one-dimensional Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional Dirac fermions in the presence of a spatially-varying Dirac velocity $v(x)$, that can form an approximate lab-based Rindler Hamiltonian describing an observer accelerating in Minkowski spacetime. A sudden switch from a spatially homogeneous velocity ($v(x)$ constant) to a spatially-verying velocity ($v(x)$ inhomogeneous) leads to the phenomenon of particle creation, i.e., an analog Unruh effect. We study the dependence of the analog Unruh effect on the precise form of the velocity profile, finding that while the ideal Unruh effect occurs for $v(x) \propto |x|$, a modified Unruh effect still occurs for more realistic velocity profiles that are linear for $|x|$ smaller than a length scale $\lambda$ and constant for $|x|\gg \lambda$ (such as $v(x)\propto \tanh \big(|x|/\lambda \big)$). We show that the associated particle creation is localized to $|x|\ll \lambda$.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated Hofstadter subbands in minimally twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene has been proven to be a versatile platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. Extensive investigations have been invoked focusing on the zero-magnetic-field phase diagram at the magic twist angle around $\theta=1.1\degree$, which has been indicated to be an exclusive regime for exhibiting flat band with the interplay of strong electronic correlation and untrivial topology in the experiment so far. In contrast, electronic bands in non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene host dominant electronic kinetic energy compared to Coulomb interaction. By quenching the kinetic energy and enhancing Coulomb exchange interactions by means of an applied perpendicular magnetic field, here we unveil gapped flat Hofstadter subbands at large magnetic flux that yield correlated insulating states in minimally twisted bilayer graphene at $\theta=0.41\degree$. These states appear with isospin symmetry breaking due to strong Coulomb interactions. Our work provides a platform for studying the phase transition of the strongly correlated Hofstadter spectrum.</description>

      <title>Optimization of submicron Ni/Au/Ge contacts to an AlGaAs/GaAs two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on fabrication and performance of submicron Ni/Au/Ge contacts to a two-dimensional electron gas in an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. Utilizing scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and low temperature electrical measurements we investigate the relationship between contact performance and the mechanical and chemical properties of the annealed metal stack. Contact geometry and crystallographic orientation significantly impact performance. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of germanium in the annealed contact plays a central role in the creation of high transmission contacts. We characterize the transmission of our contacts at high magnetic fields in the quantum Hall regime. Our work establishes that contacts with area 0.5 square microns and resistance less than 400 Ohms can be fabricated with high yield.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Ferro-Valleytricity in Penta-Layer Rhombohedral Graphene for Memory and Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with multiple degrees of freedom, including spin, valleys, and orbitals, open up an exciting avenue for engineering multifunctional devices. Beyond spintronics, these degrees of freedom can lead to novel quantum effects such as valley-dependent Hall effects and orbital magnetism, which could revolutionize next-generation electronics. However, achieving independent control over valley polarization and orbital magnetism has been a challenge due to the need for large electric fields. A recent breakthrough involving penta-layer rhombohedral graphene has demonstrated the ability to individually manipulate anomalous Hall signals and orbital magnetic hysteresis, forming what is known as a valley-magnetic quartet. Here, we leverage the electrically tunable Ferro-valleytricity of penta-layer rhombohedral graphene to develop non-volatile memory and in-memory computation applications. We propose an architecture for a dense, scalable, and selector-less non-volatile memory array that harnesses the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity. In our designed array architecture, non-destructive read and write operations are conducted by sensing the valley state through two different pairs of terminals, allowing for independent optimization of read/write peripheral circuits. The power consumption of our PRG-based array is remarkably low, with only ~ 6 nW required per write operation and ~ 2.3 nW per read operation per cell. This consumption is orders of magnitude lower than that of the majority of state-of-the-art cryogenic memories. Additionally, we engineer in-memory computation by implementing majority logic operations within our proposed non-volatile memory array without modifying the peripheral circuitry. Our framework presents a promising pathway toward achieving ultra-dense cryogenic memory and in-memory computation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Single photon emitters in monolayer semiconductors coupled to transition metal dichalcogenide nanoantennas on silica and gold substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single photon emitters (SPEs) offer numerous advantages to quantum information applications, such as high single photon purity and deterministic positioning. Strain in the host monolayer, induced by underlying dielectric Mie resonators, is known to localize their formation to positions co-located with near-field photonic hotspots providing further control over their optical properties. However, traditional materials used for the fabrication of nanoresonators, such as silicon or gallium phosphide (GaP), often require a high refractive index substrate resulting in losses of the emitted light and limited photonic enhancement. Here, we use nanoantennas (NAs) fabricated from multilayer TMDs, which allow complete flexibility with the choice of substrate due to the adhesive van der Waals forces, enabling high refractive index contrast or the use of highly reflective metallic surfaces. We demonstrate the localized formation of SPEs in WSe$_2$ monolayers transferred onto WS$_2$ NAs on both SiO$_2$ and Au substrates, enabling strong photonic enhancements and increased single photon collection. We provide evidence for enhanced quantum efficiencies (QE) reaching an average value of 43% (7%) for SPEs on WS$_2$ NAs on a SiO$_2$ (Au) substrate. We further combine the advantages offered by both dielectric and metallic substrates to numerically simulate an optimized NA geometry for maximum WSe$_2$ single photon excitation, emission, collection. Thus, the fluorescence is enhanced by a factor of over 4 orders of magnitude compared to vacuum and 5 orders of magnitude compared to a flat SiO$_2$/Si surface. Our work showcases the advantages offered by employing TMD material nanoresonators on various substrates for SPE formation and photonic enhancement.</description>

      <title>Ultra-steep slope cryogenic FETs based on bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic field-effect transistors (FETs) offer great potential for a wide range of applications, the most notable example being classical control electronics for quantum information processors. In the latter context, on-chip FETs with low power consumption are a crucial requirement. This, in turn, requires operating voltages in the millivolt range, which are only achievable in devices with ultra-steep subthreshold slopes. However, in conventional cryogenic metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)FETs based on bulk material, the experimentally achieved inverse subthreshold slopes saturate around a few mV/dec due to disorder and charged defects at the MOS interface. FETs based on two-dimensional materials offer a promising alternative. Here, we show that FETs based on Bernal stacked bilayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride and graphite gates exhibit inverse subthreshold slopes of down to 250 ${\mu}$V/dec at 0.1 K, approaching the Boltzmann limit. This result indicates an effective suppression of band tailing in van-der-Waals heterostructures without bulk interfaces, leading to superior device performance at cryogenic temperature.</description>

      <title>Machine learning topological energy braiding of non-Bloch bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been used to identify phase transitions in a variety of physical systems. However, there is still a lack of relevant research on non-Bloch energy braiding in non-Hermitian systems. In this work, we study non-Bloch energy braiding in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems using unsupervised and supervised methods. In unsupervised learning, we use diffusion maps to successfully identify non-Bloch energy braiding without any prior knowledge and combine it with k-means to cluster different topological elements into clusters, such as Unlink and Hopf link. In supervised learning, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Bloch energy data to predict not only Bloch energy braiding but also non-Bloch energy braiding with an accuracy approaching 100%. By analysing the CNN, we can ascertain that the network has successfully acquired the ability to recognise the braiding topology of the energy bands. The present study demonstrates the considerable potential of machine learning in the identification of non-Hermitian topological phases and energy braiding.</description>

      <title>Spin parallel transport and holonomy on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum conductance of flat (Euclidean) circuits subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling shows a symmetric response to the inversion of the spin-orbit field in Aharonov-Casher interference patterns. Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) circuits defined on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset. We discuss triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.</description>

      <title>Dipole orientation reveals single-molecule interactions and dynamics on 2D crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct observation of single-molecule interactions and dynamic configurations in situ is a demanding challenge but crucial for both chemical and biological systems. However, optical microscopy that relies on bulk measurements cannot meet these requirements due to rapid molecular diffusion in solutions and the complexity of reaction systems. In this work, we leveraged the fluorescence activation of pristine hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in organic solvents as a molecular sensing platform, confining the molecules to a two-dimensional (2D) interface and slowing down their motion. Conformational recognition and dynamic tracking were achieved simultaneously by measuring the 3D orientation of fluorescent emitters through polarized single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We found that the orientation of in-plane emitters aligns with the symmetry of the h-BN lattice, and their conformation is influenced by both the local conditions of h-BN and the regulation of the electrochemical environment. Additionally, lateral diffusion of fluorescent emitters at the solid-liquid interface displays more abundant dynamics compared to solid-state emitters. This study opens the door for the simultaneous molecular conformation and photophysics measurement, contributing to the understanding of interactions at the single-molecule level and real-time sensing through 2D materials.</description>

      <title>An ambipolar single-charge pump in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism of single-charge pumping using a dynamic quantum dot needs to be precisely understood for high-accuracy and universal operation toward applications to quantum current standards and quantum information devices. The type of charge carrier (electron or hole) is an important factor for determining the pumping accuracy, but it has been so far compared just using different devices that could have different potential landscapes. Here, we report measurements of a silicon ambipolar single-charge pump. It allows a comparison between the single-electron and single-hole pumps that share the entrance tunnel barrier, which is a critical part of the pumping operation. By changing the frequency and temperature, we reveal that the entrance barrier has a better energy selectivity in the single-hole pumping, leading to a pumping error rate better than that in the single-electron pumping up to 400 MHz. This result implies that the heavy effective mass of holes is related to the superior characteristics in the single-hole pumping, which would be an important finding for stably realizing accurate single-charge pumping operation.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection for MnTe altermagnet candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study electron transport across a single planar junction between the indium electrode and MnTe altermagnet candidate. We confirm standard Ohmic behavior with strictly linear current-voltage curves above the indium critical field or temperature, although with high, about 100~kOhm, junction resistance. At low temperatures and in zero magnetic field, we observe a well-developed Andreev curve with the pronounced coherence peaks, which cannot be normally expected for these high values of normal junction resistance. The conclusion on the Andreev reflection is also supported by suppression in magnetic field, as well as by universality of the observed behavior for all of the investigated samples. The experimental results can be explained by specifics of Andreev transport through the disordered region at the superconductor-altermagnet interface. Due to a different set of restrictions on the possibility of Andreev reflection, an altermagnet suffers from the presence of disorder less than a normal spin-degenerate metal, so the conductance enhancement is retained throughout the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Artificially built Kondo chains with organic radicals on metallic surfaces: new model system of heavy fermion quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy fermion quantum criticality is an extremely rich domain of research which represents a framework to understand strange metals as a consequence of a Kondo breakdown transition. Here we provide an experimental realization of such systems in terms of organic radicals on a metallic surface. The ground state of organic radicals is a Kramer's doublet that can be modeled by a spin 1/2 degree of freedom. Using on-surface synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip manipulation, one can controllably engineer and characterize chains of organic radicals on a Au(111) surface. The spatial-resolved differential conductance reveals site-dependent low-energy excitations, which support the picture of emergent many-body Kondo physics. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a Kondo lattice model of spin chains on a metallic surface reproduces accurately the experimental results. This allows us to interpret the experimental results in terms of a heavy fermion metal, below the coherence temperature. We foresee that the tunability of these systems will pave the way to realize quantum simulators of heavy fermion criticality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most intriguing properties of magnonic systems is their reconfigurability, where an external magnetic field alters the static magnetic configuration to influence magnetization dynamics. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to tunable magnonic systems. We studied a magnonic crystal induced within a uniform magnetic layer by a periodic magnetic field pattern created by the array of superconducting strips. We showed that the spin-wave spectrum can be tuned by the inhomogeneous stray field of the superconductor in response to a small uniform external magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrated that modifying the width of superconducting strips and separation between them leads to the changes in the internal field which are unprecedented in conventional magnonic structures. The paper presents the results of semi-analytical calculations for realistic structures, which are verified by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Exchange control in a MOS double quantum dot made using a 300 mm wafer process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the advanced manufacturing capabilities of the semiconductor industry promises to help scale up silicon-based quantum processors by increasing yield, uniformity and integration. Recent studies of quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes have shown control and readout of individual spin qubits, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm wafer MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, forming the basis of an entangling gate such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of 10. We further extend the coherence by up to an order of magnitude using an echo sequence. For readout, we introduce a dispersive readout technique, the radiofrequency electron cascade, that amplifies the signal while retaining the spin-projective nature of dispersive measurements. Our results demonstrate an industrial grade platform for two-qubit operations, alongside integration with dispersive sensing techniques.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum conductors attached to metallic reservoirs have been demonstrated to overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), a trade-off relation between the amount of dissipation and the absence of charge and heat current fluctuations. Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting reservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport processes, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their retro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal quasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns. The large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative and highly stable quantum thermal machines.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental advancements in dissipation control have yielded significant insights into non-hermitian Hamiltonians for open quantum systems. Of particular interest are the topological characteristics exhibited by these non-hermitian systems, that arise from exceptional points - distinct degeneracies unique to such systems. In this study, we focus on Andreev bound states in multiterminal Josephson junctions with non-hermiticity induced by normal metal or ferromagnetic leads. By investigating several systems of different synthetic dimensions and symmetries, we predict fragile and stable non-hermitian topological phases in these engineered superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Transverse magnetic field effects on metastable states of magnetic island chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-dimensional chain of elongated anisotropic magnetic islands on a nonmagnetic substrate with dipolar interactions and an applied magnetic field transverse to the chain is considered. With the long axes of the islands perpendicular to the chain, the system allows for three uniform metastable states: (1) tilted dipoles with magnetization at an oblique angle to the chain, (2) transverse dipoles with magnetization perpendicular to the chain, and (3) alternating transverse dipoles with no net magnetization. The uniform magnetic field controls their stabilities and is analyzed for its ability to cause transitions among the states. The energy and frequency eigenvalues are determined for small-amplitude traveling wave deviations of the dipoles. The results are summarized in a phase diagram in the field/anisotropy plane, that highlights the multistable properties of this type of system.</description>

      <title>Deep sub-wavelength scale focusing of heat flux radiated by magneto-optical nanoemitters in the presence of an external magnetic-field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework to describe the heat flux radiated in the near-field regime by a set of magneto-optical thermal nanoemitters close to a substrate in the presence of an external magnetic field. Then, we investigate the particular case of a single emitter and we demonstrate that the external field can induce both an amplification of the heat exchanged between emittter and substrate and a focusing of the Poynting field at the substrate interface at deep sub-wavelength scale. These effects open up promising perspectives for the development of heat-assisted magnetic-recording technology.</description>

      <title>Linear response in planar Hall and thermal Hall setups for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., non-quantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. We have also considered the response arising from internode scatterings. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Luttinger Liquids from sublattice dependent interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how Exceptional Points (EPs) naturally occur in the Luttinger Liquid (LL) theory describing the low-energy excitations of a microscopic lattice model with sublattice dependent electron-electron interaction. Upon bosonization, this sublattice dependence directly translates to a non-standard sine-Gordon-type term responsible for the non-Hermitian matrix structure of the single-particle Green Function (GF). As the structure in the lifetime of excitations does not commute with the underlying free Bloch Hamiltonian, non-Hermitian topological properties of the single-particle GF emerge -- despite our Hermitian model Hamiltonian. Both finite temperature and a non-trivial Luttinger parameter $K\neq 1$ are required for the formation of EPs, and their topological stability in one spatial dimension is guaranteed by the chiral symmetry of our model. In the presence of the aforementioned sine-Gordon-term, we resort to leading order Perturbation Theory (PT) to compute the single-particle GF. All qualitative findings derived within LL theory are corroborated by comparison to both numerical simulations within the conserving second Born approximation, and, for weak interactions and high temperatures, by fermionic plain PT. In certain parameter regimes, quantitative agreement can be reached by a suitable parameter choice in the effective bosonized model.</description>

Abstract: Projected wave functions offer a means for incorporating local correlation effects in gapless electronic phases of matter like metals. Although such wave functions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their associated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern numerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a constructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like fermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for one-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against exact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller projection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a correlation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density modulation in the system.</description>

      <title>Proposal for unambiguous measurement of braid statistics in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasiparticles (QPs) or quasiholes (QHs) of fractional quantum Hall states have been predicted to obey fractional braid statistics, which refers to the Berry phase (in addition to the usual Aharonov-Bohm phase) associated with an exchange of two QPs or two QHs, or equivalently, to half of the phase associated with a QP / QH going around another. Certain phase slips in interference experiments in the fractional quantum Hall regime have been interpreted as arising from the statistics associated with a QP moving along the edge of the sample around another QP in the interior. A conceptual difficulty with this interpretation is that the edge, being compressible, does not support a QP or a QH with a sharply quantized fractional charge or fractional statistics. We analyze the experiment in terms of composite fermions (CFs) obeying integral braid statistics and suggest that the observed phase slips can be naturally understood as a measure of the relative braid statistics of a CF in the ground state at the edge and a fractionally charged QP / QH in the interior; in contrast to fractionally charged excitations, the CFs are known to remain sharply defined even in compressible regions such as the edge or the CF Fermi liquid state at half filled Landau level. We further propose that transport through a closed $\textit{tunneling}$ loop confined entirely in the bulk can, in principle, allow an unambiguous measurement of the relative braid statistics of a fractionally charged QP / QH braiding around another fractionally charged QP / QH. Optimal parameters for this experimental geometry are determined from quantitative calculations.</description>

      <title>Phonon screening of excitons in atomically thin semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin semiconductors, encompassing both 2D materials and quantum wells, exhibit a pronounced enhancement of excitonic effects due to geometric confinement. Consequently, these materials have become foundational platforms for the exploration and utilization of excitons. Recent ab initio studies have demonstrated that phonons can substantially screen electron-hole interactions in bulk semiconductors and strongly modify the properties of excitons. While excitonic properties of atomically thin semiconductors have been the subject of extensive theoretical investigations, the role of phonon screening on excitons in atomically thin structures remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate via ab initio GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations that phonon screening can have a significant impact on optical excitations in atomically thin semiconductors. We further show that the degree of phonon screening can be tuned by structural engineering. We focus on atomically thin GaN quantum wells embedded in AlN and identify specific phonons in the surrounding material, AlN, that dramatically alter the lowest-lying exciton in monolayer GaN via screening. Our studies provide new intuition beyond standard models into the interplay among structural properties, phonon characteristics, and exciton properties in atomically thin semiconductors, and have implications for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Fast Growth of High-Quality Atomically Thin and Atomically Flat Bi$_2$O$_2$Se Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a novel and promising 2D material, bismuth oxyselenide (Bi$_2$O$_2$Se) has demonstrated significant potential to overcome existing technical barriers in various electronic device applications, due to its unique physical properties like high symmetry, adjustable electronic structure, ultra-high electron mobility. However, the rapid growth of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se films down to a few atomic layers with precise control remains a significant challenge. In this work, the growth of two-dimensional (2D) Bi$_2$O$_2$Se thin films by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method is systematically investigated. By controlling temperature, oxygen pressure, laser energy density and laser emission frequency, we successfully prepare atomically thin and flat Bi$_2$O$_2$Se (001) thin films on the (001) surface of SrTiO3. Importantly, we provide a fundamental and unique perspective toward understanding the growth process of atomically thin and flat Bi$_2$O$_2$Se films, and the growth process can be primarily summarized into four steps: i) anisotropic non-spontaneous nucleation preferentially along the step roots; ii) monolayer Bi$_2$O$_2$Se nanosheets expanding across the surrounding area, and eventually covering the entire STO substrate step; iii) vertical growth of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se monolayer in a 2D Frank-van der Merwe (FM) epitaxial growth, and iv) with a layer-by-layer 2D FM growth mode, ultimately producing an atomically flat and epitaxially aligned thin film. Moreover, the combined results of the crystallinity quality, surface morphology and the chemical states manifest the successful PLD-growth of high-quality Bi$_2$O$_2$Se films in a controllable and fast mode.</description>

      <title>Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth and Doping Modulation of Topological Semimetal NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, high-quality thin films of the topological semimetal phase NiTe$_2$ were prepared using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique, confirmed through X-ray diffraction with pronounced Laue oscillations. Electrical transport experiments reveal that thick films have properties similar to bulk materials. By employing co-deposition, we introduced either magnetic or non-magnetic elements during the growth of thinner films, significantly altering their electrical properties. Notably, magnetic element Cr induces long-range ferromagnetic ordering, leading to the observation of significant anomalous Hall effect in NiTe2 thin films. The Hall conductivity remains nearly constant well below the Curie temperature, indicating the correlation with the intrinsic topological nature of the band structure. Theoretical first principles band calculations support the generation of the Weyl semimetal state in the material through magnetic doping. These findings pave the way for exploring more magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and related low-dimensional quantum devices based on topological semimetal materials.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with an impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under both open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. This exact solution is thoroughly validated by numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the impurity-induced counter skin-effect. These findings offer unprecedented insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. Furthermore, our results suggest potential applications in quantum sensing, where the unique characteristics of the impurity-induced counter skin-effect could be harnessed for enhanced sensitivity and precision.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin and orbital angular momentum of light in twisted photonic bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical response of twisted photonic bilayers is sensitive to both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. Due to the transfer of the angular momenta between the light and the bilayer, optical beams with zero SAM and OAM acquire SAM upon transmission and OAM upon reflection. Our numerical calculations and the developed analytical theory show that the values of the emergent SAM and OAM depend differently on the interlayer distance and can be controlled by tuning the twist angle. The predicted phenomena do not require light absorption and are caused by the helicity-dependent light diffraction on the moir\'e pattern, which inevitably occurs in the twisted structure, and SAM-OAM conversion. We also reveal strong SAM and OAM in the moir\'e-diffracted beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unveil the key-role of dimensionality in describing chiroptical properties of molecules embedded inside an optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity. For a 2D-layer configuration, we show that the interplay between molecular chirality and spatial dispersion of the cavity-modes, results in a gyrotropic coupling $\chi$ at the origin of a differential shift in polaritonic energy-spectra. This differential shift is proportional to $\chi$, while for 3D bulk-aggregate configurations it is shown to vanish. We interpret physically the former 2D-chiral effect by analogy with the classical Newtonian motion of a fictive particle in presence of 3D restoring force, and static magnetic field. The gyrotropic coupling is shown to directly perturbate the anholonomy angle of the classical trajectories, and the fictive particle undergoes cyclotron gyrations upon entering the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mobile impurity immersed in a non-interacting Fermi sea is dressed by the gapless particle-hole excitations of the fermionic medium. This conventional Fermi-polaron setting is well described by the so-called ladder approximation, which consists in neglecting impurity-hole scattering processes. In this work, we analyze polaron formation in the context of insulating states of matter, considering increasing levels of correlation in the medium:~band insulators originating from external periodic potentials, spontaneously-formed charge density waves, and a Fermi-Hubbard system undergoing a metal-Mott insulator transition. The polaron spectral function is shown to exhibit striking signatures of the underlying fermionic background, such as the single-particle band gap, particle-hole symmetry and the transition to the Mott state. These signatures are identified within the framework of the Chevy ansatz, i.e. upon restricting the Hilbert space to single particle-hole excitations. Interestingly, we find that the ladder approximation is inaccurate in these band systems, due to the fact that the particle and hole scattering phase spaces are comparable. Our results provide a step forward in the understanding of polaron formation in correlated many-body media, which are relevant to both cold-atom and semiconductor experiments.</description>

Abstract: Strain in two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted particular attention owing to the remarkable modification of electronic and optical properties. However, emergent electromechanical phenomena and hidden mechanisms, such as strain-superlattice-induced topological states or flexoelectricity under strain gradient, remain under debate. Here, using scanning photocurrent microscopy, we observe significant photocurrent enhancement in hybrid vertical junction devices made of strained few-layer graphene and InGaN quantum dots. Optoelectronic response and photoluminescence measurements demonstrate a possible mechanism closely tied to the flexoelectric effect in few-layer graphene, where the strain can induce a lateral built-in electric field and assist the separation of electron-hole pairs. Photocurrent mapping reveals an unprecedentedly ordered hexagonal network, suggesting the potential to create a superlattice by strain engineering. Our work provides insights into optoelectronic phenomena in the presence of strain and paves the way for practical applications associated with strained 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: We report on experimental observation of next-nearest-neighbour coupling between ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton condensates in a planar semiconductor microcavity. All-optical control over the coupling strength between neighbouring condensates is demonstrated through distance-periodic pseudospin screening of their ballistic particle outflow due to the inherent splitting of the planar cavity transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes. By screening the nearest-neighbour coupling we overcome the conventional spatial coupling hierarchy between condensates. This offers a promising route towards creating unconventional non-planar many-body Hamiltonians using networks of ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton condensates.</description>

      <title>Thermal signature of helical molecule: Beyond nearest-neighbor electron hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate, for the first time, the thermal signature of a single-stranded helical molecule that is described beyond usual nearest-neighbor electron hopping, by analyzing electronic specific heat. Depending on the hopping of electrons, two different kinds of helical systems are considered. In one case the hopping is confined within a few neighboring lattice sites which is referred to as short-range hopping helix, while in the other case, electrons can hop in all possible sites making the system a long-range hopping one. These two helices accurately emulate the structures of single-stranded DNA and protein molecules, respectively. Each helix geometry is exposed to a transverse electric field applied perpendicular to the helix axis. The interplay among the helicity, higher-order hopping, and the electric field has significant impact on thermal response. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis reveals that, under low-temperature conditions, the short-range hopping helix exhibits greater sensitivity to temperature compared to the long-range hopping helix system. Conversely, the scenario reverses in the high-temperature limit. The thermal response of the helices can be modified selectively by means of the electric field, and the difference between the specific heats of the two helices gradually decreases with increasing the field strength. The molecular handedness, on the other hand, does not have any appreciable effect on the thermal signature. In addition, we also explore a significant application of electronic specific heat (ESH). Finally, we discuss the results of ESH by considering the spin degree of freedom and in the context of real biological helical systems.</description>

      <title>Coupling Dynamics and Linear Polarization Phenomena in Codirectional Polariton Waveguide Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the potential of spin-based integrated devices using polariton waveguides that form codirectional couplers. For suitable coupler parameters, a transfer of condensates between the arms of the coupler, occurs leading to the observation of Josephson-like oscillations. The ability to tune the periodicity of these oscillations opens the way to the design of polaritonic circuits in which the directionality of the signal towards the output terminals can be controlled. We also investigate the response of the devices to linearly polarized excitation, delving into the dynamics of linear polarization at the output terminals of long couplers, providing valuable insights into the potential applications of spin-based polariton devices, including polariton switches and logic gates with efficient operation. Our results are supported by numerical simulations based on generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing the dynamics of coherent polaritons in spatially non-uniform system. We show, how the coupling and the controllable spin degree of freedom in polariton couplers opens avenues for innovative optical architectures and functionalities.</description>

      <title>Disordered Majorana nanowires: Studying disorder without any disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of disorder and short finite wire length is the crucial physics hindering progress in the semiconductor-superconductor nanowire platform for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZM). Disorder effectively segments the nanowire into isolated patches of quantum dots (QD) which act as subgap Andreev bound states often mimicking MZMs. In this work, we propose and develop a new theoretical approach to model disorder, effectively a spatially varying effective mass model, which does not rely on incorporating unknown microscopic details of disorder into the Hamiltonian. This model effectively segments the wire into multiple QDs, characterized by highly enhanced effective mass at impurity sites leading to the segmentation of the wire into effective random QDs. We find that this model can reproduce disorder physics, providing a crystal clear way to understand the effects of disorder by comparing the mean free path to the superconducting coherence length. In addition, this model allows precise control over the disorder regime, enabling us to evaluate the reliability of topological invariants (TI) in predicting MZMs. We find that TIs alone may yield a significant false positive rate as indicators for topology in the actual wire with increasing disorder strength. Therefore, we propose new indicators to characterize the spatial distribution of the zero-energy state, emphasizing the key necessity for isolated MZMs localized at wire ends. Employing this set of new indicators for stringent characterizations, we explore their experimental relevance to the measured differential conductance spectra. Our findings highlight the critical role of isolated localized states, beyond the TI, in identifying topological MZMs. We believe that this approach is a powerful tool for studying realistic Majorana nanowires where disorder and short wire length obfuscate the underlying topological physics.</description>

      <title>QDsim: A user-friendly toolbox for simulating large-scale quantum dot devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce QDsim, a python package tailored for the rapid generation of charge stability diagrams in large-scale quantum dot devices, extending beyond traditional double or triple dots. QDsim is founded on the constant interaction model from which we rephrase the task of finding the lowest energy charge configuration as a convex optimization problem. Therefore, we can leverage the existing package CVXPY, in combination with an appropriate powerful solver, for the convex optimization which streamlines the creation of stability diagrams and polytopes. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate how QDsim enables the generation of large-scale dataset that can serve a basis for the training of machine-learning models for automated tuning algorithms. While the package currently does not support quantum effects beyond the constant interaction model, QDsim is a tool that directly addresses the critical need for cost-effective and expeditious data acquisition for better tuning algorithms in order to accelerate the development of semiconductor quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Path integral approach to bosonisation and nonlinearities in exciton-polariton systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large exciton-polariton optical nonlinearities present a key mechanism for photonics-based communication, ultimately in the quantum regime. Enhanced nonlinear response from various materials hosting excitons and allowing for their strong coupling with light is therefore the topic of intense studies, both in theoretical and experimental domains. Reports on the scattering rates arising due to various system's nonlinearities, such as the exciton-exciton Coulomb interaction and the Pauli blocking that leads to the saturation of the exciton oscillator strength, however, are contradictory. In this work, we develop a formalism allowing to track the exciton nonlinearities appearing in the regime of strong coupling with photons, that includes finite temperatures, mixing of the exciton excited states, and the dark exciton contributions to saturation self-consistently. The equilibrium path integration approach employed here to address the polariton composite nature, leads to a transparent hierarchy of various contributions to nonlinearity. At the same time, by taking the simplest limit of zero temperature and so-called "rigid" excitons, through our framework we retrieve the expressions derived in conventional approaches for exciton interaction constants. In particular, our theory allows to clearly show that such interaction constants cannot be used as fitting parameters tunable in a wide range of values, as they are strictly defined by the material properties, and that other explanations are due for large optical nonlinearities recently reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that two formulas of the orbital magnetic susceptibility, namely, Koshino-Ando's formula and G\'{o}mez-Santos and Stauber's formula, are equivalent for the tight-binding models. The difference between these two formulas can be written in a form containing the surface terms arising from the momentum-space integration, and we show that the surface terms are exactly vanishing although the primitive functions are seemingly non-periodic with respect to the translation by the reciprocal lattice vector.</description>

Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. This approach is employed to obtain a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system. We apply the transfer matrix method to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnet heterostructures have emerged as new platforms to explore exotic magnetic orders and quantum phenomena. Here, we study heterostructures of layered antiferromagnets, CrI3 and CrCl3, with perpendicular and in-plane magnetic anisotropy, respectively. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy, we demonstrate out-of-plane magnetic order in the CrCl3 layer proximal to CrI3, with ferromagnetic interfacial coupling between the two. Such an interlayer exchange field leads to higher critical temperature than that of either CrI3 or CrCl3 alone. We further demonstrate significant electric-field control of the coercivity, attributed to the naturally broken structural inversion symmetry of the heterostructure allowing unprecedented direct coupling between electric field and interfacial magnetism. These findings illustrate the opportunity to explore exotic magnetic phases and engineer spintronic devices in vdW heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

Abstract: We predict a general local spin-flip transition mechanism caused by magnetic quantum impurities in (partially) polarized phases of quantum magnets in the absence of conservation laws. This transition arises when a magnon bound state crosses zero energy as function of the magnetic field. As application, we study 2D van der Waals magnets described by the Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb model which applies to the transition metal trihalides CrI$_3$ and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We consider adatom and substitutional impurity positions, and show how spin-flip transitions can be detected in scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where cells nonlinearly compete for neuronal firing while supressing neighbouring cells.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>
