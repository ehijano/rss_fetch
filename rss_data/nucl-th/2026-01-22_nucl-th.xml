      <title>Possible Existence of $^3_\phi$H, $^4_\phi$H, $^4_\phi$He, and $^5_\phi$He Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent HAL QCD simulations of the $\phi N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel and its modification in the $^2S_{1/2}$ channel, we develop a first-principles few-body framework that embeds these potentials into configuration-space Faddeev--Yakubovsky equations. We predict bound $^4_\phi\mathrm{H}$, $^4_\phi\mathrm{He}$, and $^5_\phi\mathrm{He}$ nuclei by performing calculations for $\phi$-mesic $\phi NNN$ and $\phi NNNN$ systems. Both spin-dependent and spin-independent $\phi N$ interactions are considered, leading to deeply and moderately bound states, respectively. The deeply bound states originate from the strong attraction in the $^2S_{1/2}$ $\phi N$ channel. Coulomb shifts of the binding energies are evaluated. Our findings provide the binding mechanism and demonstrate the importance of short-range $\phi N$ attraction.</description>

      <title>How Threshold Effects in Spectroscopic Factors Influence Heavy-Ion Knockout Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-decade-old puzzle in heavy-ion one-nucleon knockout reactions is the strong correlation between the reduction factor $R_s=\sigma_{\rm exp}/\sigma_{\rm th}$ and the Fermi surface asymmetry $\Delta S$. Theoretical cross sections typically rely on spectroscopic factors (SFs) from shell model (SM) calculations, which neglect continuum coupling effects. Here, we employ the Gamow shell model (GSM), which explicitly incorporates continuum coupling, to compute SFs for $p$-shell nuclei and predict corresponding theoretical cross sections. Systematic calculations demonstrate that using GSM-derived SFs substantially reduces discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results. This improvement is particularly significant for deeply bound nucleon knockout in nuclei near the dripline, where traditional SM-based calculations fall short. As a result, using GSM SFs, the ratio $R_s$ exhibits no pronounced dependence on $\Delta S$. Furthermore, both the ratio of GSM SFs to SM SFs and their corresponding reaction cross sections ratios exhibit a strong $\Delta S$ dependence. We have also compared GSM SFs and cross sections with those from the no-core shell model calculations, giving a similar pronounced sensitivity to $\Delta S$. Detailed analysis attributes these correlations to threshold effects for SFs in weakly bound systems. Overall, incorporating continuum coupling via GSM enhances the reliability of SF predictions for exotic, weakly bound nuclei and provides key insights toward resolving the enduring puzzle in heavy-ion knockout reactions from a nuclear structure perspective.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} study of spectroscopic factors in $^{48}$K and neighboring $N=28$ isotones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent \(^{47}\text{K}(d,p\gamma)^{48}\text{K}\) transfer reaction measurement has identified new excited states in \(^{48}\text{K}\) and extracted the corresponding spectroscopic factors (SFs)[\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.162504}{C. J. Paxman, \textit{et al.} PhysRevLett.134.162504 (2025)}], but they exposed sizeable discrepancies with large-scale shell-model (LSSM) calculations-especially for the low-lying states-suggesting shortcomings in the proton-neutron interaction employed by the LSSM. In this work, we revisit the low-lying states and SFs of \(^{48}\text{K}\) using the \textit{ab initio} valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) approach based on the chiral two- and three-nucleon forces. The calculated excitation energies reproduce the experimental data for \(^{48}\text{K}\), whereas computed SFs systematically exceed experimental values. We trace this overestimation to missing reduction factors that account for non-idealities of the transfer reaction. After introducing a phenomenological reduction factor, our VS-IMSRG results and the LSSM calculations achieve agreement with experiment. We also perform the same analysis for the neutron SFs of $^{47}$Ar. Furthermore, we extend the \textit{ab initio} calculations across the $N=28$ isotones, computing excitation energies and single-neutron transfer SFs from $N=29$ isotones ranging from $^{48}$K to $^{45}$S. By systematically removing protons from \(^{48}\text{K}\) to \(^{45}\text{S}\), we trace the evolution of the \(N=28\) shell strength via theoretical SFs values. Our results provide a microscopic pathway to quantify the weakening of the \(N=28\) shell closure.</description>

      <title>$H$ dibaryon and its cousins from SU(6)-constrained baryon-baryon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the $S$-wave baryon-baryon interaction using SU(6) symmetry within a nonrelativistic effective field theory. The most general leading-order Lagrangian contains two independent parameters, which we determine using physical $NN$ and lattice QCD $\Omega\Omega$ scattering lengths. This framework allows for parameter-free predictions in the strangeness $S=-2$ sector relevant to the $H$ dibaryon. Solving the coupled-channel scattering problem, we identify two bound states below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, one deeply bound and one shallow, along with resonances near the $\Sigma\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^*\Sigma^*$ thresholds. We demonstrate that these poles result in distinct enhancements in $\Lambda\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions, suggesting that the $H$ dibaryon exists as a multichannel bound state and providing clear signatures for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of angular momentum projected nuclear wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular momentum projection is a basic technique in constructing nuclear wave functions with good spins. Traditionally, a projected nuclear wave function is expressed in terms of the bases built by performing the angular momentum projection directly on reference states for the whole nuclear system. Alternatively, one can construct nuclear wave function with another kind of projected bases, called as the coupled projected bases, which are generated by first performing the angular momentum projections on the reference states for neutrons and protons, respectively, then coupling the neutron projected states with the proton ones via Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. In the present work, we derive a new identity, which provides a decomposition of the conventional angular momentum projected nuclear wave function in terms of the coupled projected bases. This decomposition offers direct insight into the underlying structure of nuclear states. To show this point, we present the decompositions of variation after projection shell model (VAPSM) wave functions for the ground states in some $sd$ shell nuclei. It is interesting to see that even for the ground states in even-even nuclei, the nucleons are not fully paired. Finally, we demonstrate that the VAPSM wave function can be further improved by adopting the coupled projected bases.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of ideal spin fluids and pseudo-gauge ambiguity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conserved currents of relativistic spin fluids derived from microscopic models are known to violate local thermodynamic relations. We present a systematic analysis of pseudo-gauge improvements in ideal spin hydrodynamics and identify a family of pseudo-gauges where standard thermodynamic relations are satisfied. We quantify pseudo-gauge ambiguities in the spin equation of state and derive universal thermodynamic relations that apply to conserved currents in any pseudo-gauge. As an application, we extract the thermodynamic variables and equations of state for free Dirac fermions and scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Elastic lepton-proton two-photon exchange scattering: An exact HB$\chi$PT analysis including hadronic effects at NNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical evaluation of the two-photon exchange (TPE) correction to the elastic lepton-proton differential scattering cross section at low-energies within the framework of heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory. Our analysis focuses on the kinematic regime relevant to the ongoing MUSE experiment, and we therefore restrict the intermediate states to the dominant elastic channel. All loop integrals are evaluated analytically without approximations. Radiative and chiral recoil contributions of the proton are included, retaining kinematical and dynamical TPE corrections to the cross section through next-to-next-to-leading order [i.e., ${\mathcal O}(\alpha/M^2)$] accuracy in the recoil expansion where $M$ is the proton mass. At this chiral order, pion-loop contributions demonstrate that structure-dependent TPE effects arise through the proton form factors. Our analytical results for the scattering cross section reveal non-vanishing residual proton structure effects of ${\mathcal O}(\alpha/M^2)$, despite substantial cancellations between TPE box and crossed-box contributions. Such effects were entirely absent at this accuracy in our earlier analysis based on the soft-photon approximation. Although the next-to-leading-order contributions are numerically sizable, the next-to-next-to-leading-order TPE corrections are found to be small, thereby indicating that the chiral expansion exhibits reasonably good perturbative convergence.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>

      <title>Probing Late-Stage Hadronic Interactions at High Baryon Density via $K^{*0}$ Production in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the $K^{*0}$ meson yield is reported in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7,\; 11.5,\; 14.6,\; 19.6,$ and $27~\mathrm{GeV}$ using the high-statistics data sample collected by the STAR experiment during the Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program at RHIC. The transeverse momentum ($p_{T}$)-integrated yield ratios $(K^{*0} + \overline{K^{*0}})/(K^{+} + K^{-})$ in central collisions show a suppression relative to peripheral collisions at the $(1.7\text{-}3.6)\,\sigma$ level, while a thermal model without final-stage rescattering overpredicts this ratio with a deviation of $(6.9\text{-}8.2)\,\sigma$. These results indicate a loss of the measured $K^{*0}$ signal in central collisions due to re-scattering of its hadronic decay products in the hadronic phase. The $p_{T}$-integrated yield of charged kaons exhibits an approximate scaling with charged-particle multiplicity, independent of collision energy and system size. A similar trend is observed for the short-lived $K^{*0}$ resonance, although significant deviations emerge at lower energies. At BES energies, the $K^{*0}/K$ ratio shows stronger suppression than at the highest RHIC and LHC energies within a given multiplicity bin, particularly in central and mid-central collisions. This behavior is consistent with changes in the effective hadronic interaction cross section and is supported by transport model calculations, which indicate dominant meson-baryon interactions at lower energies and meson-meson interactions at higher energies.</description>

      <title>Carroll hydrodynamics with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate Carroll hydrodynamics with the inclusion of a spin current. Our strategy relies on the fact that the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics yields the equations of Carroll hydrodynamics. Starting with the pre-ultralocal parametrization of the background geometry and the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom for a relativistic fluid endowed with a spin current, the $c\to 0$ limit produces Carroll hydrodynamics with spin. It is known that boost-invariant hydrodynamic models for ultrarelativistic fluids relevant for the physics of quark-gluon plasma, such as Bjorken and Gubser flow, are manifestations of Carroll hydrodynamics under appropriate geometric choices for the underlying Carrollian structure. In this work, we further this mapping between such boost-invariant models and Carroll hydrodynamics, now with the inclusion of a spin current.</description>

      <title>Combined constraints on dark photons from high-energy collisions, cosmology, and astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) through a kinetically mixed dark photon $U$ associated with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing $\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_\chi$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\!\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($\pi^0,\eta,\eta',\omega$), Delta-resonances ($\Delta\!\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($\rho,\omega,\phi\!\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\bar q\!\to U$ annihilation. Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_\chi,\alpha_\chi)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U&lt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U&gt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to\chi\bar\chi$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $\sigma/m_\chi$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $\Omega_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_\chi,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.</description>

      <title>Complex-scaled no-core shell model calculations of bound and unbound nuclear states in light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex scaling method is commonly used to describe decaying states, but its applications are limited because the Hamiltonian operator must contain only relative coordinates. This has hindered the use of complex scaling in models defined with laboratory single-particle coordinates, and in particular one of the most important model in low-energy nuclear physics, the no-core shell model. We will then present a straightforward procedure for introducing complex scaling in the no-core shell model in order to calculate nuclear resonance states. For that matter, the complex-scaled two-body matrix elements must firstly be determined, and the resulting many-body Hamiltonian complex symmetric matrix must be diagonalized afterwards. Applications pertain to the bound ground states of the lightest nuclei $^2{\rm H}$, $^3{\rm H}$, $^3{\rm He}$, and $^4{\rm He}$, as well as the resonance ground states of $^5$He and $^5$Li, whereby the realistic interaction Daejeon16 is utilized.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ Exact Calculation of Strongly-Correlated Nucleonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense nucleonic matter is of vital importance for understanding compact stars and inferring the transition into deconfined quark phase. We present the $\textit{ab initio}$ exact calculations of infinite nucleonic matter with the state-of-the-art full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, enabling us to rigorously benchmark many-body methods and assess the degree to which the nucleonic matter is correlated. This method has been numerically validated by exact diagonalization within a small model space. Calculations of nucleonic matter using chiral nuclear forces reveal that the symmetric nuclear matter is strikingly strongly correlated, raising questions on previous $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of nuclear matter with many-body expansion truncations and offering insights into simultaneous descriptions of finite nuclei and infinite nucleonic matter from first principles.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Nuclear Structure: Atomic Nuclei on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing a gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) in strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location, and the conventional scaling relations can be violated in the presence of strong magnetic fields. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the jet angular broadening with photon-tagged jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The medium modification of jet substructure in hot and dense nuclear matter has garnered significant interest from the heavy-ion physics community in recent years. Measurements of inclusive jets show an angular narrowing in nucleus-nucleus collisions, while recent CMS results for photon-tagged jets ($\gamma$+jets) suggest evidence of broadening. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the angular structure of inclusive jets and $\gamma$+jets using a transport approach that accounts for jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We examine the girth modification of $\gamma$+jets in $0-30\%$ PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, achieving satisfactory agreement with recent CMS measurements. We explore the relationship between selection bias and jet kinematics by varying the threshold for $x_{j\gamma} = p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^{\gamma}$. Notably, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\gamma$+jets significantly reduce selection bias and can effectively select jets that have been sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions, which is crucial for capture the jet angular broadening. Additionally, we estimate the contributions of medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure. Lastly, we analyze the modification patterns of jet $R_g$ and $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ in PbPb collisions, which indicate slight broadening for $\gamma$+jets and noticeable narrowing for inclusive jets compared to pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the medium separation scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

      <title>Perfect spin hydrodynamics at all orders in spin polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two recently developed frameworks of perfect spin hydrodynamics for spin-$1/2$ particles, based respectively on classical kinetic theory and the Wigner function. We show that the conserved currents in both approaches have the same form at each order of the expansion in the components of the spin polarization tensor $\omega$. The only difference is a relative multiplicative factor, which is equal to 1 at the lowest nontrivial order and increases monotonically with the expansion order.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent moments of the pion GPD from nonlocal quark-bilinear correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills (YM) theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory (CFT) describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory (QFT) that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>
