      <title>An involution for Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two generalizations of the Alvis-Curtis duality for Hecke algebras: an unequal parameter version for the affine Hecke algebras, based on S.-I. Kato's work, and a relative version for finite Hecke algebras, based on Howlett-Lehrer's work. Our results for the finite case focus on the involution theorem for finite Hecke algebras that appear in Howlett-Lehrer's theory, where they proved a version for characters of certain subgroups of a Weyl group. We hope that our results will serve as a stepping stone for the study of involution for an arbitrary Bernstein block in the p-adic reductive group case. We also prove their compatibility with the Alvis-Curtis-Kawanaka duality (Aubert-Zelevinsky duality) when restricted to some Harish-Chandra series (resp. Bernstein blocks). This article is part of the author's PhD thesis.</description>

      <title>The Aubert-Zelevinsky involution for $G_2$ and its associated Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Aubert-Xu and the techniques in G. Muic's article, we provide examples of computations of the Aubert-Zelevinsky duality functor for the principal and mediate series of the exceptional group $G_2$, and deduce corresponding results regarding the involution on the Hecke algebra side. These computations also allow us to confirm several instances of the Bernstein conjecture for $G_2$. This article is developed from part of the author's PhD thesis.</description>

      <title>Category $\mathcal{O}$ for Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the authors define a general Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra. The construction encompasses (i) the parabolic Category ${\mathcal O}$ for complex semisimple Lie algebras, and (ii) the known constructions of Category ${\mathcal O}$ for specific examples of classical Lie superalgebras. In particular, a parabolic version of Category ${\mathcal O}^{\mathfrak p}$ for quasi-reductive Lie superalgebras ${\mathfrak g}\cong {\mathfrak g}_{\overline{0}}\oplus {\mathfrak g}_{\overline{1}}$ is developed. In this paper, the authors demonstrate how the parabolic category ${\mathcal O}^{{\mathfrak p}_{\overline{0}}}$ for the reductive Lie algebra ${\mathfrak g}_{\overline{0}}$ plays an important role in the representation theory and cohomology for ${\mathcal O}^{\mathfrak p}$.
  Connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology are firmly established. These results are then used to show that the Category ${\mathcal O}$ is standardly stratified. The definition of standardly stratified used in this context is generalized from the original definition of Cline, Parshall, and Scott. Other applications involve showing that the categorical cohomology for ${\mathcal O}^{\mathfrak p}$ is a finitely generated ring. Furthermore, it is shown that the complexity of modules in Category ${\mathcal O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in the given Lie superalgebra.</description>

      <title>Minimal numbers of linear constituents in Sylow restrictions for symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be any prime. We determine precisely those irreducible characters of symmetric groups which contain at most $p$ distinct linear constituents in their restriction to a Sylow $p$-subgroup, answering a question of Giannelli and Navarro. Moreover, we identify all of the linear constituents of such characters, and in the case $p = 2$ explicitly calculate a new class of Sylow branching coefficients for symmetric groups indexed by so-called almost hook partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the dimension of the cohomology of stalks of intersection cohomology complexes on Zastava schemes and Drinfeld compactifications associated with a connected reductive algebraic group $G$, in case the characteristic of the coefficients field $\Bbbk$ is good for $G$. In particular, we show that these dimensions do not depend on the choice of $\Bbbk$.</description>

      <title>Quantization of infinitesimal braidings and pre-Cartier quasi-bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Cartier's deformation theorem of braided monoidal categories admitting an infinitesimal braiding to the non-symmetric case. The algebraic counterpart of these categories is the notion of a pre-Cartier quasi-bialgebra, which extends the well-known notion of quasitriangular quasi-bialgebra given by Drinfeld. Our result implies that one can quantize the infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrix of any Cartier quasi-bialgebra. We further discuss the emerging concepts of infinitesimal quantum Yang-Baxter equation and Cartier ring, the latter containing braid groups with additional generators that correspond to infinitesimal braidings. Explicit deformations of the representation categories of the gauge deformed quasitriangular quasi-bialgebras $E(n)$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Universal geometrical link invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct geometrically two universal link invariants: universal ADO invariant and universal Jones invariant, as limits of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. More specifically, for a fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define new link invariants: ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' and ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Alexander invariant''. They globalise topologically all coloured Jones polynomials for links with multi-colours bounded by $\mathscr N$ and all ADO polynomials with bounded colours. These invariants both come from the same weighted Lagrangian intersection supported on configurations on arcs and ovals in the disc. The question of providing a universal non semi-simple link invariant, recovering all the ADO polynomials was an open problem. A parallel question about semi-simple invariants for the case of knots is the subject of Habiro's famous universal knot invariant \cite{H3}. Habiro's universal construction is well defined for knots and can be extended just for certain classes of links. Our universal Jones link invariant is defined for any link and recovers all coloured Jones polynomials, providing a new semi-simple universal link invariant. The first non-semi simple universal link invariant that we construct unifies all ADO invariants for links, answering the open problem about the globalisation of these invariants. The geometrical origin of our construction provides a new topological perspective for the study of the asymptotics of these (non) semi-simple invariants, for which a purely topological $3$-dimensional description is a deep problem in quantum topology. Since our models are defined for links they open avenues for constructing universal invariants for three manifolds unifying the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant and the Costantino-Geer-Patureau invariants through purely geometrical lenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.11357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{G}$ be a special parahoric group scheme of twisted type over the ring of formal power series over $\mathbb{C}$, excluding the absolutely special case of $A_{2\ell}^{(2)}$. Using the methods and results of Zhu, we prove a duality theorem for general $\mathscr{G}$ : there is a duality between the level one twisted affine Demazure modules and the function rings of certain torus fixed point subschemes in affine Schubert varieties for $\mathscr{G}$. Along the way, we also establish the duality theorem for $E_6$. As a consequence, we determine the smooth locus of any affine Schubert variety in the affine Grassmannian of $\mathscr{G}$. In particular, this confirms a conjecture of Haines and Richarz.</description>

      <title>Oligomorphic groups, categories of partial bijections, and ultrahomogeneous cubic spaces over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for certain class of oligomorphic groups there is a version of multiplication of double cosets in the Ismagilov--Olshanski sense. Categories of (reduced) double cosets are realized as certain categories of partial bijections. As an example, we consider the ultrahomogeneous linear space $\mathcal{Z}$ of countable dimension over afinite field equipped with a cubic form. The group of automorphisms of $\mathcal{Z}$ is an oligomorphic group, we describe its open subgroups. According Tsankov, this gives a classification of its unitary representations. The category of reduced double cosets in this case is the category of partial linear bijections of finite-dimensional cubic spaces preserving cubic forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G/K$ be an irreducible quaternionic symmetric space of rank $4$. We study the principal series representation $\pi_\nu=\text{Ind}_P^G(1\otimes e^\nu\otimes 1)$ of $G$ induced from the Heisenberg parabolic subgroup $P=MAN$ realized on $L^2(K/L)$, $L=K\cap M$. We find the $K$-types in the induced representation via a double cover $K/L_0\to K/L$ and a circle bundle $K/L_0\to K/L_1$ over a compact Hermitian symmetric space $K/L_1$. We compute the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$-action of $G$ on the representation space. We find the complementary series, reducible points, and unitary subrepresentations in this family of representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M{\oe}glin-Renard parametrized A-packet of unitary group through cohomological induction in good parity case. Each parameter gives rise to an $A_{\mathfrak q}(\lambda)$ which is either $0$ or irreducible. Trapa proposed an algorithm to determine whether a ``mediocre'' $A_{\mathfrak q}(\lambda)$ of $\mathrm U(p, q)$ is non-zero. Based on his result, we present a further understanding of the non-zero condition on M{\oe}glin-Renard's parametrization. Our criterion comes out to be a system of linear constraints, and has the same formulation as $p$-adic case. This suggests a map from A-packets of real unitary group to A-packets of $p$-adic symplectic group or special orthogonal group.</description>

      <title>On the complementary Arthur representations and unitary dual for p-adic classical groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [HJLLZ24], we proposed a new conjecture on the structure of the unitary dual of connected reductive groups over non-Archimedean local fields of characteristic zero based on their Arthur representations and verified it for all the known cases on the unitary dual problem. One step towards this conjecture involves the question whether certain complementary Arthur representations are unitary. In this paper, we give an explicit characterization of the complementary Arthur representations for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups. As applications, we obtain interesting constraints on local components of irreducible self-dual cuspidal automorphic representations of GL(N), especially when N=2,3.</description>

      <title>Universal families of twisted cotangent bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex algebraic group $G$ and complex $G$-variety $X$, one can study the affine Hamiltonian Lagrangian (AHL) $G$-bundles over $X$. Lisiecki indexes the isomorphism classes of such bundles in the case of a homogeneous $G$-variety $X=G/H$; the indexing set is the set of $H$-fixed points $(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the Lie algebra of $H$. In very rough terms, one may regard $\psi\in(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H$ as labeling the isomorphism class of a $\psi$-twisted cotangent bundle of $G/H$. These twisted cotangent bundles feature prominently in geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry.
  We introduce and examine the notion of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a $G$-variety $X$, as part of a broader program on Lie-theoretic and incidence-theoretic constructions of regular Poisson varieties. This family is defined to be a flat family $\pi:\mathcal{U}\longrightarrow Y$, in which $\mathcal{U}$ is a Poisson variety, the fibers of $\pi$ form a complete list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of AHL $G$-bundles over $X$, and other pertinent properties are satisfied. Our first main result is the construction of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a homogeneous base $X=G/H$, for connected $H$. In our second main result, we take $X$ to be a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of self-normalizing closed subgroups of $G$. We associate to $\mathcal{C}$ a regular Poisson variety $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$, defined in incidence-theoretic terms. Attention is paid to the case of conjugacy classes of normalizers of symmetric subgroups. In the case of a connected semisimple group $G$ and conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subgroups, our third main result relates $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$ to the partial Grothendieck-Springer resolution for $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Compact Matrix Quantum Group Equivariant Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group equivariant neural networks have proven effective in modelling a wide range of tasks where the data lives in a classical geometric space and exhibits well-defined group symmetries. However, these networks are not suitable for learning from data that lives in a non-commutative geometry, described formally by non-commutative $C^{*}$-algebras, since the $C^{*}$-algebra of continuous functions on a compact matrix group is commutative. To address this limitation, we derive the existence of a new type of equivariant neural network, called compact matrix quantum group equivariant neural networks, which encode symmetries that are described by compact matrix quantum groups. We characterise the weight matrices that appear in these neural networks for the easy compact matrix quantum groups, which are defined by set partitions. As a result, we obtain new characterisations of equivariant weight matrices for some compact matrix groups that have not appeared previously in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we prove that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds for $A$. We further construct a semidirect product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, and establish a correspondence between equivariant sheaves on the representation space and left $A\rtimes\mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, using the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations of a preprojective algebra and those of a quiver variety.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth quasi-affine variety $X$, the affine closure $\overline{T^*X} := \text{Spec}(k[T^*X])$ contains $T^*X$ as an open subset, and its smooth locus carries a symplectic structure. A natural question is whether $\overline{T^*X}$ itself is a symplectic variety. A notable example is the conjecture of Ginzburg and Kazhdan, which predicts that $\overline{T^*(G/U)}$ is symplectic for a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ in a reductive linear algebraic group $G$. This conjecture was recently proved by Gannon using representation-theoretic methods.
  In this paper, we provide a new geometric approach to this conjecture. Our method allows us to prove a more general result: $\overline{T^*(G/H)}$ is symplectic for any horospherical subgroup $H$ in $G$ such that $G/H$ is quasi-affine. In particular, this implies that the affine closure $\overline{T^*(G/[P,P])}$ is a symplectic variety for any parabolic subgroup $P$ in $G$.</description>

      <title>Permutation Equivariant Neural Networks for Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating permutation equivariance into neural networks has proven to be useful in ensuring that models respect symmetries that exist in data. Symmetric tensors, which naturally appear in statistics, machine learning, and graph theory, are essential for many applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, amongst others. However, existing research on permutation equivariant models has not explored symmetric tensors as inputs, and most prior work on learning from these tensors has focused on equivariance to Euclidean groups. In this paper, we present two different characterisations of all linear permutation equivariant functions between symmetric power spaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show on two tasks that these functions are highly data efficient compared to standard MLPs and have potential to generalise well to symmetric tensors of different sizes.</description>
