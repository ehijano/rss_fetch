      <title>Anderson localization in high-contrast media with random spherical inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of partial differential operators modelling composite materials with highly contrasting constituents, comprised of soft spherical inclusions with random radii dispersed in a stiff matrix. Such operators have recently attracted significant interest from the research community, including in the context of stochastic homogenization. In particular, it has been proved that the spectrum of these operators may feature a band-gap structure in the regime where heterogeneities take place on a sufficiently small scale. However, the nature of the limiting (as the small scale tends to zero) spectrum in the above setting is non-classical and not completely understood. In this paper we prove for the first time that Anderson localization occurs near band edges, thus shedding light on the limiting spectral behaviour. Our results rely on recent nontrivial advancements in quantitative unique continuation for PDEs, in combination with assumptions on the model that are standard in the Anderson localization literature, and which we plan to relax in future works.</description>

      <title>The discrete wave equation with applications to scattering theory and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a view towards studying the multitemporal wave equation on affine buildings recently introduced by Anker-R\'emy-Trojan [arXiv:2312.06860], we systematically develop the basic properties of the discrete wave equation on $\mathbb{Z}$ and use this to explain existing results about the wave equation on regular graphs. Furthermore, we explicitly compute the incoming and outgoing translation representations and the scattering operator, in the sense of Lax-Phillips, for regular and biregular trees. Finally, we use the wave equation on biregular graphs to extend a result of Brooks-Lindenstrauss about delocalization of eigenfunctions on regular graphs to the setting of biregular graphs.</description>

      <title>On the growth properties of interior transmission eigenfunctions near corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the localization and vanishing of $L^2$ interior transmission eigenfunctions at corners. Past numerical computations suggest that these eigenfunctions localize at non-convex corners. This phenomenon has, however, not been proven theoretically. We show that localization does indeed occur for some eigenfunctions at a non-convex corner.
  We also investigate the vanishing of interior transmission eigenfunctions at a convex corner. We prove that these eigenfunctions vanish at convex corners with reduced smoothness assumptions compared to earlier results.</description>

      <title>Short geodesics and multiplicities of eigenvalues of hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain upper bounds on the multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues for closed hyperbolic surfaces in terms of the number of short closed geodesics and the genus $g$. For example, we show that if the number of short closed geodesics is sublinear in $g$, then the multiplicity of the first eigenvalue is also sublinear in $g$. This makes new progress on a conjecture by Colin de Verdi\`ere in the mid 1980s.</description>
