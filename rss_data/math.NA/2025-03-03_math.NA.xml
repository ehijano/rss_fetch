      <title>Wavelet-based density sketching with functional hierarchical tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the functional hierarchical tensor under a wavelet basis (FHT-W) ansatz for high-dimensional density estimation in lattice models. Recently, the functional tensor network has emerged as a suitable candidate for density estimation due to its ability to calculate the normalization constant exactly, a defining feature not enjoyed by neural network alternatives such as energy-based models or diffusion models. While current functional tensor network models show good performance for lattice models with weak or moderate couplings, we show that they face significant model capacity constraints when applied to lattice models with strong coupling. To address this issue, this work proposes to perform density estimation on the lattice model under a wavelet transformation. Motivated by the literature on scale separation, we perform iterative wavelet coarsening to separate the lattice model into different scales. Based on this multiscale structure, we design a new functional hierarchical tensor ansatz using a hierarchical tree topology, whereby information on the finer scale is further away from the root node of the tree. Our experiments show that the numerical rank of typical lattice models is significantly lower under appropriate wavelet transformation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model allows one to model challenging Gaussian field models and Ginzburg-Landau models.</description>

      <title>Localization of tumor through a non-conventional numerical shape optimization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for estimating the shape and location of an embedded tumor. The approach utilizes shape optimization techniques, applying the coupled complex boundary method. By rewriting the problem--characterized by a measured temperature profile and corresponding flux (e.g., from infrared thermography)--into a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition, the method simplifies the over-specified nature of the problem. The size and location of the tumor are identified by optimizing a cost function based on the imaginary part of the solution across the domain. Shape sensitivity analysis is conducted to compute the shape derivative of the functional. An iterative algorithm, which uses the Riesz representative of the gradient, is developed to numerically determine the geometry of the tumor via the finite element method. Additionally, we analyze the mesh sensitivity of the finite element solution of the associated state problem and derive a bound on its variation in terms of mesh deformation and its gradient. The result, valid in any dimension, applies to arbitrary unstructured simplicial meshes and finite element approximations. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving particle-in-cell method for the magnetized Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop and rigorously analyze a new class of particle methods for the magnetized Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck system. The proposed approach addresses two fundamental challenges: (1) the curse of dimensionality, which we mitigate through particle methods while preserving the system's asymptotic properties, and (2) the temporal step size limitation imposed by the small Larmor radius in strong magnetic fields, which we overcome through semi-implicit discretization schemes. We establish the theoretical foundations of our method, proving its asymptotic-preserving characteristics and uniform convergence through rigorous mathematical analysis. These theoretical results are complemented by extensive numerical experiments that validate the method's effectiveness in long-term simulations. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed numerical framework accurately captures key physical phenomena, particularly the magnetic confinement effects on plasma behavior, while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent convergence rate of propagation of chaos and numerical analysis for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with coefficients nonlinearly dependent on measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to ordinary stochastic differential equations (SDEs), the numerical simulation of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) requires approximating the distribution law first. Based on the theory of propagation of chaos, particle approximation method is widely used. Then, a natural question is to investigate the convergence rate of the method (also referred to as the convergence rate of PoC). In fact, the PoC convergence rate is well understood for MV-SDEs with coefficients linearly dependent on the measure, but the rate deteriorates with dimension $d$ under the $L^p$-Wasserstein metric for nonlinear measure-dependent coefficients, even when Lipschitz continuity with respect to the measure is assumed. The main objective of this paper is to establish a dimension-independent convergence result of PoC for MV-SDEs whose coefficients are nonlinear with respect to the measure component but Lipschitz continuous. As a complement we further give the time discretization of the equations and thus verify the convergence rate of PoC using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the $L_2$-discrepancy of Latin hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $L_2$-discrepancies of what we call weak Latin hypercubes. In this case it turns out that there is a precise equivalence between the extreme and periodic $L_2$-discrepancy which follows from a much broader result about generalized energies for weighted point sets.
  Motivated by this we study the asymptotics of the optimal $L_2$-discrepancy of weak Latin hypercubes. We determine asymptotically tight bounds for $d \geq 3$ and even the precise (dimension dependent) constant in front of the dominating term for $d \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Numerical Solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) play a central role in many applications such as economics, physics, and engineering. These equations describe the evolution of a value function which encodes valuable information about the system, such as action, cost, or level sets of a dynamic process. Their importance lies in their ability to model diverse phenomena, ranging from the propagation of fronts in computational physics to optimal decision-making in control systems. This paper provides a review of some recent advances in numerical methods to address challenges such as high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and computational efficiency. By examining these developments, this paper sheds light on important techniques and emerging directions in the numerical solution of HJ PDEs.</description>

      <title>Parametric-ROM of Structures with Varying Geometry using Direct Parameterization of Invariant Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for parametric reduction in FEM, where geometry is controlled by a parameter without altering material properties or stress states. The inverse determinant in the weak form is expanded as a power series, with explicit expressions for the zeroth and first-order terms. External forcing and parameter dependence are incorporated into an enlarged autonomous system, reduced via the direct parameterization of invariant manifolds method and homological equations. The parameter is treated as an additional variable with trivial dynamics, isolated for inclusion in the ROM. This approach enables efficient parametric studies and advances reduced-order modeling in structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Parallel, Energy-Stable Low-Rank Integrator for Nonlinear Multi-Scale Thermal Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal radiative transfer models physical phenomena ranging from supernovas in astrophysics to radiation from a hohlraum striking a fusion target in plasma physics. Transport and absorption of particles in radiative transfer at different rates lead to a complex interaction between the material and particles that involves highly varying time scales. Resolving these effects can require prohibitively small step sizes, which, combined with nonlinear effects and the particle density's high-dimensional phase space, render conventional numerical methods computationally expensive. This work presents an asymptotic--preserving, mass conservative, rank-adaptive, and parallel integrator for a macro--micro decomposition-based dynamical low-rank approximation of the thermal radiative transfer equations. The proposed integrator efficiently incorporates reflection-transmission type boundary conditions in the low-rank factors. It captures the nonlinear effects of thermal radiation and is energy stable with the step size restriction capturing both hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions. The efficacy of the proposed integrator is demonstrated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>MultiResolution Low-Rank Regularization of Dynamic Imaging Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MultiResolution Low-Rank decomposition is formulated for regularization of dynamic image sequences. The decomposition applies a local low-rank decomposition on a sequence of discrete wavelet transforms. Its effective formulation as a regularization functional is discussed and numerically tested for dynamic X-ray tomography in comparison to other low-rank methods. The results suggest it is similar to traditional locally low-rank decomposition but produces less severe block artifacts.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation for the Critical Value of Eikonal Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical value of an eikonal equation is the unique value of a parameter for which the equation admits solutions and is deeply related to the effective Hamiltonian of a corresponding homogenization problem. We study approximation strategies for the critical value of eikonal equations posed on networks. They are based on the large time behavior of corresponding time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We provide error estimates and some numerical tests, showing the performance and the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>A spectral boundary element method for acoustic interference problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider high-frequency acoustic transmission problems with jumping coefficients modelled by Helmholtz equations. The solution then is highly oscillatory and, in addition, may be localized in a very small vicinity of interfaces (whispering gallery modes). For the reliable numerical approximation a) the PDE is tranformed in a classical single trace integral equation on the interfaces and b) a spectral Galerkin boundary element method is employed for its solution. We show that the resulting integral equation is well posed and analyze the convergence of the boundary element method for the particular case of concentric circular interfaces. We prove a condition on the number of degrees of freedom for quasi-optimal convergence. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our method and the sharpness of the theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>A parallel-in-time solver for nonlinear degenerate time-periodic parabolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of abstract nonlinear time-periodic evolution problems is considered which arise in electrical engineering and other scientific disciplines. An efficient solver is proposed for the systems arising after discretization in time based on a fixed-point iteration. Every step of this iteration amounts to the solution of a discretized time-periodic and time-invariant problem for which efficient parallel-in-time methods are available. Global convergence with contraction factors independent of the discretization parameters is established. Together with an appropriate initialization step, a highly efficient and reliable solver is obtained. The applicability and performance of the proposed method is illustrated by simulations of a power transformer. Further comparison is made with other solution strategies proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>A data augmentation strategy for deep neural networks with application to epidemic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate the predictive capabilities of compartmental disease dynamics models with machine learning ability to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and uncover patterns that conventional models may overlook. Specifically, we present a proof of concept demonstrating the application of data-driven methods and deep neural networks to a recently introduced SIR-type model with social features, including a saturated incidence rate, to improve epidemic prediction and forecasting. Our results show that a robust data augmentation strategy trough suitable data-driven models can improve the reliability of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Networks (NARs), making them viable alternatives to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This approach enhances the ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and offers scalable, data-driven solutions for epidemic forecasting, prioritizing predictive accuracy over the constraints of physics-based models. Numerical simulations of the post-lockdown phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Spain validate our methodology.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Relaxation Flux Solver for Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations based on Generalized Riemann Problem Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the finite volume framework, a Lax-Wendrof type second-order flux solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is proposed by utilizing a hyperbolic relaxation model. The flux solver is developed by applying the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) method to the relaxation model that approximates the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The GRP-based flux solver includes the effects of source terms in numerical fluxes and treats the stiff source terms implicitly, allowing a CFL condition conventionally used for the Euler equations. The trade-off is to solve linear systems of algebraic equations. The resulting numerical scheme achieves second-order accuracy within a single stage, and the linear systems are solved only once in a time step. The parameters to establish the relaxation model are allowed to be locally determined at each cell interface, improving the adaptability to diverse flow regions. Numerical tests with a wide range of flow problems, from nearly incompressible to supersonic flows with strong shocks, for both inviscid and viscous problems, demonstrate the high resolution of the current second-order scheme.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of space-dependence and nonlinearity of a reaction term in a subdiffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the simultaneous reconstruction of two coefficients in a reaction-subdiffusion equation, namely a nonlinearity and a space dependent factor. The fact that these are coupled in a multiplicative matter makes the reconstruction particularly challenging. Several situations of overposed data are considered: boundary observations over a time interval, interior observations at final time, as well as a combination thereof. We devise fixed point schemes and also describe application of a frozen Newton method. In the final time data case we prove convergence of the fixed point scheme as well as uniqueness of both coefficients. Numerical experiments illustrate performance of the reconstruction methods, in particular dependence on the differentiation order in the subdiffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Derivative-Free Optimization Using Adaptive Correlation-Induced Finite Difference Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based methods are well-suited for derivative-free optimization (DFO), where finite-difference (FD) estimates are commonly used as gradient surrogates. Traditional stochastic approximation methods, such as Kiefer-Wolfowitz (KW) and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), typically utilize only two samples per iteration, resulting in imprecise gradient estimates and necessitating diminishing step sizes for convergence. In this paper, we first explore an efficient FD estimate, referred to as correlation-induced FD estimate, which is a batch-based estimate. Then, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically determines the batch size at each iteration. By combining these two components, we develop an algorithm designed to enhance DFO in terms of both gradient estimation efficiency and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we establish the consistency of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that, despite using a batch of samples per iteration, it achieves the same convergence rate as the KW and SPSA methods. Additionally, we propose a novel stochastic line search technique to adaptively tune the step size in practice. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments confirm the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>The spatially discrete to continuous limit in the nonlocal quantum diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a spatial discretization of the non-local Quantum Drift Diffusion (nlQDD) model by Degond, M\`{e}hats and Ringhofer in one space dimension. With our approach, that uses consistently matrices on ${\mathbb C}^N$ instead of operators on $L^2$, we circumvent a variety of analytical subtleties in the analysis of the original nlQDD equation, e.g. related to positivity of densities or to the quantum exponential function.
  Our starting point is spatially discretized quantum Boltzmann equation with a BGK-type collision kernel, from which we derive the discretized nlQDD model in the diffusive limit. Then we verify that solutions dissipate the von-Neumann entropy, which is a known key property of the original nlQDD, and prove global existence of positive solutions, which seems to be a particular feature of the discretization. Our main result concerns convergence of the scheme: discrete solutions converge -- locally uniformly with respect to space and time -- to classical solutions of the the original nlQDD model on any time interval $[0,T)$ on which the latter remain positive. In particular, this extends the existence theory for nlQDD, that has been established only for initial data close to equilibrium so far.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Accelerated Proximal Gradient Methods with Variance Reduction for Composite Nonconvex Finite-Sum Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes {\sf AAPG-SPIDER}, an Adaptive Accelerated Proximal Gradient (AAPG) method with variance reduction for minimizing composite nonconvex finite-sum functions. It integrates three acceleration techniques: adaptive stepsizes, Nesterov's extrapolation, and the recursive stochastic path-integrated estimator SPIDER. While targeting stochastic finite-sum problems, {\sf AAPG-SPIDER} simplifies to {\sf AAPG} in the full-batch, non-stochastic setting, which is also of independent interest. To our knowledge, {\sf AAPG-SPIDER} and {\sf AAPG} are the first learning-rate-free methods to achieve optimal iteration complexity for this class of \textit{composite} minimization problems. Specifically, {\sf AAPG} achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^{-2})$, while {\sf AAPG-SPIDER} achieves $\mathcal{O}(N + \sqrt{N} \epsilon^{-2})$ for finding $\epsilon$-approximate stationary points, where $N$ is the number of component functions. Under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) assumption, we establish non-ergodic convergence rates for both methods. Preliminary experiments on sparse phase retrieval and linear eigenvalue problems demonstrate the superior performance of {\sf AAPG-SPIDER} and {\sf AAPG} compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Complexes from Complexes: Finite Element Complexes in Three Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Hilbert complexes have become highly significant. Recent advances focus on creating new complexes using the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) framework, as shown by Arnold and Hu [Complexes from complexes. {\em Found. Comput. Math.}, 2021]. This paper extends their approach to three-dimensional finite element complexes. The finite element Hessian, elasticity, and divdiv complexes are systematically derived by applying techniques such as smooth finite element de Rham complexes, the $t$-$n$ decomposition, and trace complexes, along with related two-dimensional finite element analogs. The construction includes two reduction operations and one augmentation operation to address continuity differences in the BGG diagram, ultimately resulting in a comprehensive and effective framework for constructing finite element complexes, which have various applications in PDE solving.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of McKean-Vlasov SDEs via stochastic gradient descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to numerically approximate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDE) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) while avoiding the use of interacting particle systems. The SGD technique is deployed to solve a Euclidean minimization problem, obtained by first representing the MV-SDE as a minimization problem over the set of continuous functions of time, and then approximating the domain with a finite-dimensional subspace. Convergence is established by proving certain intermediate stability and moment estimates of the relevant stochastic processes, including the tangent processes. Numerical experiments illustrate the competitive performance of our SGD based method compared to the IPS benchmarks. This work offers a theoretical foundation for using the SGD method in the context of numerical approximation of MV-SDEs, and provides analytical tools to study its stability and convergence.</description>

      <title>A Stabilised Semi-Implicit Double-Point Material Point Method for Soil-Water Coupled Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semi-implicit two-phase double-point Material Point Method (MPM) formulation, based on the incremental fractional-step method to model large deformation geotechnical problems has been derived. The semi-implicit formulation has two advantages compared with the explicit approach: the time step is independent of the water phase, and the pore pressure field is more stable. The semi-implicit MPM models based on the incremental fractional-step method available in the literature consist of modelling the soil and water mixture using a single set of material points only, in order to save computational time. In this study, we further derive this formulation with two sets of material points to represent the soil and water phases separately. The stress oscillations that are frequently found in the water and soil phases are stabilised with this approach. A new stabilisation method is developed based on the modified F-bar method. The proposed method is validated with two numerical examples under small and large deformations, respectively. After that, Nor-Sand constitutive soil model is used to simulate landslides. Numerical examples show an excellent performance of the proposed coupled MPM and the stabilisation method. The formulation with two sets of material points yields significantly different but more reliable results in the landslides analysis, compared with the single-point approach. Additionally, this research shows that the additional computational cost caused by the additional water material points is acceptable. Therefore, it is recommended to use two sets of material points for certain large deformation geotechnical problems.</description>

      <title>Order Conditions for Nonlinearly Partitioned Runge-Kutta Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a new class of nonlinearly partitioned Runge--Kutta (NPRK) methods was proposed for nonlinearly partitioned systems of autonomous ordinary differential equations, $y' = F(y,y)$. The target class of problems are ones in which different scales, stiffnesses, or physics are coupled in a nonlinear way, wherein the desired partition cannot be written in a classical additive or component-wise fashion. Here we use rooted-tree analysis to derive full order conditions for NPRK$_M$ methods, where $M$ denotes the number of nonlinear partitions. Due to the nonlinear coupling and thereby mixed product differentials, it turns out the standard node-colored rooted-tree analysis used in analyzing ODE integrators does not naturally apply. Instead we develop a new edge-colored rooted-tree framework to address the nonlinear coupling. The resulting order conditions are enumerated, provided directly for up to 4th order with $M=2$ and 3rd-order with $M=3$, and related to existing order conditions of additive and partitioned RK methods. We conclude with an example which shows how the nonlinear order conditions can be used to obtain an embedded estimate of the state-dependent nonlinear coupling strength in a dynamical system.</description>

      <title>A simple modification to mitigate locking in conforming FEM for nearly incompressible elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the divergence-instability, the accuracy of low-order conforming finite element methods (FEMs) for nearly incompressible elasticity equations deteriorates as the Lam\'e parameter $\lambda\to\infty$, or equivalently as the Poisson ratio $\nu\to1/2$. This effect is known as {\itshape locking} or {\itshape non-robustness}. For the piecewise linear case, the error in the ${\bf L}^2$-norm of the standard Galerkin conforming FEM is bounded by~$C\lambda h^2$, resulting in poor accuracy for practical values of~$h$ if $\lambda$ is sufficiently large. In this short paper, we show that the locking phenomenon can be reduced by replacing $\lambda$ with~$\lambda_h=\lambda\mu/(\mu+\lambda h/L)&lt;\lambda$ in the stiffness matrix, where $\mu$ is the second Lam\'e parameter and $L$ is the diameter of the body $\Omega$. We prove that with this modification, the error in the ${\bf L}^2$-norm is bounded by $Ch$ for a constant $C$ that does not depend on $\lambda$. Numerical experiments confirm this convergence behaviour and show that, for practical meshes, our method is more accurate than the standard method if $\lambda$ is larger than about $\mu L/h$. Our analysis also shows that the error in the ${\bf H}^1$-norm is bounded by $C\lambda_h^{1/2}\,h$, which improves the $C\lambda^{1/2}\,h$ estimate for the case of conforming FEM.</description>

      <title>Deflation Techniques for Finding Multiple Local Minima of a Nonlinear Least Squares Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the technique of deflation to define two new methods to systematically find many local minima of a nonlinear least squares problem. The methods are based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm, and as such do not require the calculation of a Hessian matrix. They also require fewer deflations than for applying the deflated Newton method on the first order optimality conditions, as the latter finds all stationary points, not just local minima. One application of interest covered in this paper is the inverse eigenvalue problem (IEP) associated with the modelling of spectroscopic data of relevance to the physical and chemical sciences.

      <title>A combined Lax-Wendroff/interpolation approach with finite element method for a three-dimensional system of tectonic deformation model: application to landslides in Cameroon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an efficient computational technique to assess the landslide responses to tectonic deformation and to predict the implications of large bedrocks landslides on the short and long-term development of the disasters. The considered equations represent a three-dimensional system of geological structure deformation subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. The space derivatives are approximated using the finite element procedure while the approximation in time derivative is obtained using the Lax-Wendroff and interpolation techniques. The new approach is so called a combined Lax-Wendroff/interpolation method with finite element method. The modified Lax-Wendroff/interpolation scheme is employed to efficiently treat the time derivative term and to provide a suitable time step restriction for stability. Under this time step requirement, both stability and error estimates of the new algorithm are deeply analyzed using a constructed strong norm. The theory suggests that the developed computational technique is second-order accurate in time and spatial convergent with order O(h^{p}), where $h$ denotes the space size and p is a positive integer. A wide set of numerical examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and to demonstrate the utility and validity of the proposed numerical scheme. An application to landslides observed in west and center regions in Cameroon from October 2019 to November 2024, are discussed.</description>

The concept of ``normal'' preconditioning is introduced and a strategy to construct preconditioners studying the associated ``normal'' PDE is presented.

      <title>Construction of exact refinements for the two-dimensional HB/THB-spline de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the de Rham complex is a natural choice when working with problems in electromagnetics and fluid mechanics. By discretizing the complex correctly, it is possible to attain stable numerical methods to tackle these problems. An important consideration when constructing the discrete complex is that it must preserve the cohomology structure of the original one. This property is not guaranteed when the discrete function spaces chosen are hierarchical B-splines. Research shows that a poor choice of refinement domains may give rise to spurious harmonic forms that ruin the accuracy of solutions, even for the simplest partial differential equations. Another crucial aspect to consider in the hierarchical setting is the notion of admissibility, as it is possible to obtain optimal convergence rates of numerical solutions by limiting the multi-level interaction of basis functions. We will focus on the two-dimensional de Rham complex over the unit square $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. In this scenario, the discrete de Rham complex should be exact, and we provide both the theoretical and the algorithm-implementation framework to ensure this is the case. Moreover, we show that, under a common restriction, the admissibility class of the first space of the discrete complex persists throughout the remaining spaces. Finally, we include numerical results that motivate the importance of the previous concerns for the vector Laplace and Maxwell eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel efficient algorithm for clustering and classification tasks based on the famous MBO scheme. On the one hand, inspired by Jacobs et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 2018], we introduce constraints on the size of clusters leading to a linear integer problem. We prove that the solution to this problem is induced by a novel order statistic. This viewpoint allows us to develop exact and highly efficient algorithms to solve such constrained integer problems. On the other hand, we prove an estimate of the computational complexity of our scheme, which is better than any available provable bounds for the state of the art. This rigorous analysis is based on a variational viewpoint that connects this scheme to volume-preserving mean curvature flow in the big data and small time-step limit.</description>

This work presents a deep-learning-based multi-model evaluation and downscaling framework ranking 32 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS) mechanism and so refines outputs using advanced deep-learning models. Using nine performance criteria, five K\"oppen-Geiger climate zones -- Tropical, Arid, Temperate, Continental, and Polar -- are investigated over four seasons. While TaiESM1 and CMCC-CM2-SR5 show notable biases, ranking results show that NorESM2-LM, GISS-E2-1-G, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL outperform other models. Four models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\circ}$ resolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.57$^{\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20% over ConvLSTM. CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds fine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult. These results confirm that multi-criteria ranking improves GCM selection for regional climate studies and transformer-based downscaling exceeds conventional deep-learning methods. This framework offers a scalable method to enhance high-resolution climate projections, benefiting impact assessments and adaptation plans.</description>
