      <title>Contrasting the optimal resource allocation to cybersecurity and cyber insurance using prospect theory versus expected utility theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting against cyber-threats is vital for every organization and can be done by investing in cybersecurity controls and purchasing cyber insurance. However, these are interlinked since insurance premiums could be reduced by investing more in cybersecurity controls. The expected utility theory and the prospect theory are two alternative theories explaining decision-making under risk and uncertainty, which can inform strategies for optimizing resource allocation. While the former is considered a rational approach, research has shown that most people make decisions consistent with the latter, including on insurance uptakes. We compare and contrast these two approaches to provide important insights into how the two approaches could lead to different optimal allocations resulting in differing risk exposure as well as financial costs. We introduce the concept of a risk curve and show that identifying the nature of the risk curve is a key step in deriving the optimal resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Examining Multimodal Gender and Content Bias in ChatGPT-4o</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT-4o's multimodal content generation, highlighting significant disparities in its treatment of sexual content and nudity versus violent and drug-related themes. Detailed analysis reveals that ChatGPT-4o consistently censors sexual content and nudity, while showing leniency towards violence and drug use. Moreover, a pronounced gender bias emerges, with female-specific content facing stricter regulation compared to male-specific content. This disparity likely stems from media scrutiny and public backlash over past AI controversies, prompting tech companies to impose stringent guidelines on sensitive issues to protect their reputations. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for AI systems to uphold genuine ethical standards and accountability, transcending mere political correctness. This research contributes to the understanding of biases in AI-driven language and multimodal models, calling for more balanced and ethical content moderation practices.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Model Selection for Data Clustering and Dimension Reduction Using Relative von Neumann Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a pair of completely data-driven algorithms for unsupervised classification and dimension reduction, and we empirically study their performance on a number of data sets, both simulated data in three-dimensions and images from the COIL-20 data set. The algorithms take as input a set of points sampled from a uniform distribution supported on a metric space, the latter embedded in an ambient metric space, and they output a clustering or reduction of dimension of the data. They work by constructing a natural family of graphs from the data and selecting the graph which maximizes the relative von Neumann entropy of certain normalized heat operators constructed from the graphs. Once the appropriate graph is selected, the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian may be used to reduce the dimension of the data, and clusters in the data may be identified with the kernel of the associated graph Laplacian. Notably, these algorithms do not require information about the size of a neighborhood or the desired number of clusters as input, in contrast to popular algorithms such as $k$-means, and even more modern spectral methods such as Laplacian eigenmaps, among others.
  In our computational experiments, our clustering algorithm outperforms $k$-means clustering on data sets with non-trivial geometry and topology, in particular data whose clusters are not concentrated around a specific point, and our dimension reduction algorithm is shown to work well in several simple examples.</description>
