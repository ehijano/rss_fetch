      <title>How to improve the semicontinuity bounds in [Lett. Math. Phys., 113, 121 (2023)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to improve the semicontinuity bounds in [1] by optimizing the proof of the basic technical lemma. In this optimization we apply the modified version of the trick used in the resent article [2].
  The most important applications are the semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy with the energy constraint and the semicontinuity bounds for the entanglement of formation with the rank/energy constraint.</description>

      <title>Scrambling in the Charging of Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponentially fast scrambling of an initial state characterizes quantum chaotic systems. Given the importance of quickly populating higher energy levels from low-energy states in quantum battery charging protocols, this Letter investigates the role of quantum scrambling in quantum batteries and its effect on optimal power and charging times. We adopt a bare representation with normalized bandwidths to suppress system energy dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth exploration of quantum scrambling in the context of quantum batteries. By analyzing the dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators, our findings indicate that quantum scrambling does not necessarily lead to faster charging, despite its potential for accelerating the process.</description>

      <title>Which features of quantum physics are not fundamentally quantum but are due to indeterminism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is fundamentally quantum? We argue that most of the features, problems, and paradoxes -- such as the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend paradox and its proposed solutions, single particle nonlocality, and no-cloning -- allegedly attributed to quantum physics have a clear classical analogue if one is to interpret classical physics as fundamentally indeterministic. What really characterizes quantum physics boils down only to phenomena that involve $\hbar$, i.e., incompatible observables.</description>

      <title>A Fully Gauge-Fixed SU(2) Hamiltonian for Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to construct a fully gauge-fixed lattice Hamiltonian for a pure SU(2) gauge theory. Our work extends upon previous work, where a formulation of an SU(2) lattice gauge theory was developed that is efficient to simulate at all values of the gauge coupling. That formulation utilized maximal-tree gauge, where all local gauge symmetries are fixed and a residual global gauge symmetry remains. By using the geometric picture of an SU(2) lattice gauge theory as a system of rotating rods, we demonstrate how to fix the remaining global gauge symmetry. In particular, the quantum numbers associated with total charge can be isolated by rotating between the lab and body frames using the three Euler angles. The Hilbert space in this new `sequestered' basis partitions cleanly into sectors with differing total angular momentum, which makes gauge-fixing to a particular total charge sector trivial, particularly for the charge-zero sector. In addition to this sequestered basis inheriting the property of being efficient at all values of the coupling, we show that, despite the global nature of the final gauge-fixing procedure, this Hamiltonian can be simulated using quantum resources scaling only polynomially with the lattice volume.</description>

      <title>Observation of Interface Piezoelectricity in Superconducting Devices on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of superconducting quantum processors is driven by the need to reduce errors and scale for fault-tolerant computation. Reducing physical qubit error rates requires further advances in the microscopic modeling and control of decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Piezoelectric interactions contribute to decoherence by mediating energy exchange between microwave photons and acoustic phonons. Centrosymmetric materials like silicon and sapphire do not display piezoelectricity and are the preferred substrates for superconducting qubits. However, the broken centrosymmetry at material interfaces may lead to piezoelectric losses in qubits. While this loss mechanism was predicted two decades ago, interface piezoelectricity has not been experimentally observed in superconducting devices. Here, we report the observation of interface piezoelectricity at an aluminum-silicon junction and show that it constitutes an important loss channel for superconducting devices. We fabricate aluminum interdigital surface acoustic wave transducers on silicon and demonstrate piezoelectric transduction from room temperature to millikelvin temperatures. We find an effective electromechanical coupling factor of $K^2\approx 2 \times 10^{-5}\%$ comparable to weakly piezoelectric substrates. We model the impact of the measured interface piezoelectric response on superconducting qubits and find that the piezoelectric surface loss channel limits qubit quality factors to $Q\sim10^4-10^8$ for designs with different surface participation ratios and electromechanical mode matching. These results identify electromechanical surface losses as a significant dissipation channel for superconducting qubits, and show the need for heterostructure and phononic engineering to minimize errors in next-generation superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>High gain squeezing in lossy resonators: an asymptotic field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for describing nonlinear electromagnetic interactions in integrated photonic devices utilizing an asymptotic-in/out field formalism. Our method expands upon previous continuous wave asymptotic treatments by describing the evolution non-perturbatively for an arbitrary pulsed input. This is presented in the context of a squeezing interaction within an integrated microring resonator side coupled to an input/output waveguide, but is readily generalizable to other integrated structures, while including a variety of (non-squeezing) third-order interactions. An example of a single-pump, non-degenerate squeezing interaction is studied, which is shown to match well with standard coupled-mode treatments for high-finesse resonators, as well as previous perturbative treatments dealing with the generation of pairs with low probability.</description>

      <title>Eigenoperator approach to Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory and dispersive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern quantum physics is very modular: we first understand basic building blocks (``XXZ Hamiltonian'' ``Jaynes-Cummings'' etc.) and then combine them to explore novel effects. A typical example is placing known systems inside an optical cavity. The Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation method is particularly suited for dealing with these problems, since it casts the perturbation expansion in terms of operator corrections to a Hamiltonian, which is more intuitive than energy level corrections, as in traditional time-independent perturbation theory. However, the method lacks a systematic approach.% and has largely remained a niche topic. In these notes we discuss how \emph{eigenoperator decompositions}, a concept largely used in open quantum systems, can be employed to construct an intuitive and systematic formulation of Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. To illustrate this we revisit various papers in the literature, old and new, and show how they can instead be solved using eigenoperators. Particular emphasis is given to perturbations that couple two systems with very different transition frequencies (highly off-resonance), leading to the so-called dispersive interactions.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Standard Quantum Limit with Electro-Optomechanical Hybrid System for Enhanced Force Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reduction of measurement-added noise in force sensing by analyzing its power spectral density (PSD) within a hybrid optomechanical system. The setup comprises of an optomechanical cavity equipped with a movable mirror which acts as the mechanical oscillator, a stationary semi-transparent mirror, a superconducting qubit, and an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). By utilizing the concept of coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC), we derive the conditions necessary for complete cancellation of back-action force, thereby enhancing force sensitivity. Furthermore, with the gradual increase in the OPA pump gains, we suppress the sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) at a lower value of laser power. The removal of back-action noise, along with the reduction of shot noise, improves force detection capabilities, thereby surpassing the standard quantum limit associated with weak force detection.</description>

      <title>Evolving a Multi-Population Evolutionary-QAOA on Distributed QPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research combines an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to update the ansatz parameters, in place of traditional gradient-based methods, and benchmark on the Max-Cut problem. We demonstrate that our Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) pairing performs on par or better than a COBYLA-based QAOA in terms of solution accuracy and variance, for $d$-3 regular graphs between 4 and 26 nodes, using both $max\_count$ and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness function evaluations. Furthermore, we take our algorithm one step further and present a novel approach by presenting a multi-population EA distributed on two QPUs, which evolves independent and isolated populations in parallel, classically communicating elite individuals. Experiments were conducted on both simulators and quantum hardware, and we investigated the relative performance accuracy and variance.</description>

      <title>Visibility Stokes parameters as a foundation for quantum information science with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of induced coherence without induced emission allows to reconstruct the quantum state of a photon that remains undetected. The state information is transferred to its partner photon via optical coherence. Using this phenomenon, a number of established quantum information protocols could be adapted for undetected photons. Despite partial attempts, no general procedure for such adaptation exists. Here we shed light on the matter by showing the close relation between two very dissimilar techniques, namely the quantum state tomography of qubits and the recently developed quantum state tomography of undetected photons. We do so by introducing a set of parameters that quantify the coherence and that mimic the Stokes parameters known from the polarization state tomography. We also perform a thorough analysis of the environment of undetected photons and its role in the reconstruction process.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Liouvillians of squeeze-driven parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetries of the Liouville superoperator of one dimensional parametric oscillators, especially the so-called squeeze-driven Kerr oscillator, and discover a remarkable quasi-spin symmetry $su(2)$ at integer values of the ratio $\eta =\omega /K$ of the detuning parameter $\omega$ to the Kerr coefficient $K$, which reflects the symmetry previously found for the Hamiltonian operator. We find that the Liouvillian of an $su(2)$ representation $\left\vert j,m_{j}\right\rangle$ has a characteristic double-ellipsoidal structure, and calculate the relaxation time $T_{X}$ for this structure. We then study the phase transitions of the Liouvillian which occur as a function of the parameters $\xi =\varepsilon _{2}/K$ and $\eta=\omega /K$. Finally, we study the temperature dependence of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the Liouvillian. Our findings may have applications in the generation and stabilization of states of interest in quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect emitters in silicon are promising contenders as building blocks of solid-state quantum repeaters and sensor networks. Here we investigate a family of possible isoelectronic emitter defect complexes from a design standpoint. We show that the identification of key physical effects on quantum defect state localization can guide the search for telecom wavelength emitters. We demonstrate this by performing first-principles calculations on the Q center, predicting its charged sodium variants possessing ideal emission wavelength near the lowest-loss telecom bands and ground state spin for possible spin-photon interface and nanoscale spin sensor applications yet to be explored in experiments.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient Preparation of Graph States on Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly entangled quantum states are an ingredient in numerous applications in quantum computing. However, preparing these highly entangled quantum states on currently available quantum computers at high fidelity is limited by ubiquitous errors. Besides improving the underlying technology of a quantum computer, the scale and fidelity of these entangled states in near-term quantum computers can be improved by specialized compilation methods. In this work, the compilation of quantum circuits for the preparation of highly entangled architecture-specific graph states is addressed by defining and solving a formal model. Our model incorporates information about gate cancellations, gate commutations, and accurate gate timing to determine an optimized graph state preparation circuit. Up to now, these aspects have only been considered independently of each other, typically applied to arbitrary quantum circuits. We quantify the quality of a generated state by performing stabilizer measurements and determining its fidelity. We show that our new method reduces the error when preparing a seven-qubit graph state by 3.5x on average compared to the state-of-the-art Qiskit solution. For a linear eight-qubit graph state, the error is reduced by 6.4x on average. The presented results highlight the ability of our approach to prepare higher fidelity or larger-scale graph states on gate-based quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Time Crystals from single-molecule magnet arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals, a unique non-equilibrium quantum phenomenon with promising applications in current quantum technologies, mark a significant advance in quantum mechanics. Although traditionally studied in atom-cavity and optical lattice systems, pursuing alternative nanoscale platforms for time crystals is crucial. Here we theoretically predict discrete time-crystals in a periodically driven molecular magnet array, modeled by a spin-S Heisenberg Hamiltonian with significant quadratic anisotropy, taken with realistic and experimentally relevant physical parameters. Surprisingly, we find that the time-crystal response frequency correlates with the energy levels of the individual magnets and is essentially independent of the exchange coupling. The latter is unexpectedly manifested through a pulse-like oscillation in the magnetization envelope, signaling a many-body response. These results show that molecular magnets can be a rich platform for studying time-crystalline behavior and possibly other out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Detecting and protecting entanglement through nonlocality, variational entanglement witness, and nonlocal measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an advanced method to enhance the detection and protection of quantum entanglement, a key concept in quantum mechanics for computing, communication, and beyond. Entanglement, where particles remain connected over distance, can be indicated by nonlocality, measurable through the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. While violating the inequality confirms entanglement, entanglement can still exist without such violations. To overcome this limitation, we use the CHSH violation as an entanglement measure and introduce a variational entanglement witness for more complete detection. Moreover, we propose a nonlocal measurement framework to measure the expectation values in both the CHSH inequality and variational entanglement witness. These nonlocal measurements exploit the intrinsic correlations between entangled particles, providing a more reliable approach for detecting and maintaining entanglement. This paper significantly contributes to the practical application of quantum technologies, where detecting and maintaining entanglement are essential.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement vs nonlocality for two families of $N$-qubit states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states of multiple qubits can violate Bell-type inequalities when there is entanglement present between the qubits, indicating nonlocal behaviour of correlations. We analyze the relation between multipartite entanglement and genuine multipartite nonlocality, characterized by Svetlichny inequality violations, for two families of $N-$qubit states. We show that for the generalized GHZ family of states, Svetlichny inequality is not violated when the $n-$tangle is less than $1/2$ for any number of qubits. On the other hand, the maximal slice states always violate the Svetlichny inequality when $n-$tangle is nonzero, and the violation increases monotonically with tangle when the number of qubits is even. Our work generalizes the relations between tangle and Svetlichny inequality violation previously derived for three qubits.</description>

      <title>Direct experimental observation of sub-poissonian photon statistics by means of multi-photon scattering on a two-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cascade of two-level superconducting artificial atoms -- a source and a probe -- strongly coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide is a promising tool for observing nontrivial phenomena in quantum nonlinear optics. The probe atom can scatter an antibunched radiation emitted from the source, thereby generating a field with specific properties. We experimentally demonstrate wave mixing between nonclassical light from the coherently cw-pumped source and another coherent wave acting on the probe. We observe unique features in the wave mixing stationary spectrum which differs from mixing spectrum of two classical waves on the probe. These features are well described by adapting the theory for a strongly coupled cascaded system of two atoms. We further analyze the theory to predict non-classical mixing spectra for various ratios of atoms' radiative constants. Both experimental and numerical results confirm the domination of multi-photon scattering process with only a single photon from the source. We evaluate entanglement of atoms in the quasistationary state and illustrate the connection between the expected second-order correlation function of source's field and wave mixing side peaks corresponding to a certain number of scattered photons.</description>

      <title>A quantum protocol for applying arbitrary phase transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an operator that produces the state $|\phi\rangle=\sum\phi(x)\,|x\rangle$, we propose a quantum protocol that transforms any input state of the form $|\psi\rangle=\sum\psi(x)\,|x\rangle$ to $|\psi'\rangle=\sum\psi(x)\,e^{i\alpha|\phi(x)|^2}\,|x\rangle$. This protocol is thus programmable in the sense that one can use it to apply different phase profiles $e^{i\alpha|\phi(x)|^2}$ by choosing different $|\phi\rangle$ states as the input parameter at each run. Therefore, the problem of applying phases to a signal via a quantum computer is reduced to the problem of initializing a state $|\phi\rangle$ that corresponds to the desired phase profile. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications of this protocol, most importantly in Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised state learning from pairs of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose you receive a sequence of qubits where each qubit is guaranteed to be in one of two pure states, but you do not know what those states are. Your task is to either determine the states or to construct a POVM (Positive Operator Valued Measure) that will discriminate them. This can be viewed as a quantum analog of unsupervised learning. A problem is that without more information, all that can be determined is the density matrix of the sequence, and, in general, density matrices can be decomposed into pure states in many different ways. To solve the problem additional information, either classical or quantum, is required. We show that if an additional copy of each qubit is supplied, that is, one receives pairs of qubits, both in the same state, rather than single qubits, the task can be accomplished. We then simulate numerically the measurement of a sequence of qubit pairs and show that the unknown states and their respective probabilities of occurrence can be found with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantifying nonclassical correlation via the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonclassical correlation is an important concept in quantum information theory, referring to a special type of correlation that exists between quantum systems, which surpasses the scope of classical physics. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a family of information with important properties, namely the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information, of which the famous quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase skew information are special cases.We classify the local observables in the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information into two categories (i.e., orthonormal bases and a Hermitian operator with a fixed nondegenerate spectrum), and based on this, we propose two different forms of indicators to quantify nonclassical correlations of bipartite quantum states. We have not only investigated some important properties of these two kinds of indicators but also illustrated through specific examples that they can indeed capture some nonclassical correlations. Furthermore, we find that these two types of indicators reduce to entanglement measure for bipartite pure states. Specifically, we also derive the relationship between these two indicators and the entanglement measure $I$-concurrence.</description>

      <title>Challenging Excited States from Adaptive Quantum Eigensolvers: Subspace Expansions vs. State-Averaged Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of electronic structure for strongly correlated molecules represents a promising application for near-term quantum computers. Significant attention has been paid to ground state wavefunctions, but excited states of molecules are relatively unexplored. In this work, we consider the ADAPT-VQE algorithm, a single-reference approach for obtaining ground states, and its state-averaged generalization for computing multiple states at once. We demonstrate for both rectangular and linear H$_4$, as well as for BeH$_2$, that this approach, which we call MORE-ADAPT-VQE, can make better use of small excitation manifolds than an analagous method based on a single-reference ADAPT-VQE calculation, q-sc-EOM. In particular, MORE-ADAPT-VQE is able to accurately describe both avoided crossings and crossings between states of different symmetries. In addition to more accurate excited state energies, MORE-ADAPT-VQE can recover accurate transition dipole moments in situations where traditional ADAPT-VQE and q-sc-EOM struggle. These improvements suggest a promising direction toward the use of quantum computers for difficult excited state problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a critical role in many quantum applications, but detecting entanglement, especially in multipartite or high-dimensional quantum systems, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose several families of entanglement criteria for detecting entanglement in multipartite or high-dimensional quantum states using generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and variance. We also reveal a complementary character between the criteria based on generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and an alternative one based on variance through specific examples. We illustrate the merits of these criteria and show that the combination of the entanglement criteria has a stronger detection capability, as it is capable of detecting entangled states that remain unrecognized by other criteria.</description>

      <title>Electrons herald non-classical light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free electrons are a widespread and universal source of electromagnetic fields. The past decades witnessed ever-growing control over many aspects of electron-generated radiation, from the incoherent emission produced by X-ray tubes to the exceptional brilliance of free-electron lasers. Reduced to the elementary process of quantized energy exchange between individual electrons and the electromagnetic field, electron beams may facilitate future sources of tunable quantum light. However, the quantum features of such radiation are tied to the correlation of the particles, calling for the joint electronic and photonic state to be explored for further applications. Here, we demonstrate the coherent parametric generation of non-classical states of light by free electrons. We show that the quantized electron energy loss heralds the number of photons generated in a dielectric waveguide. In Hanbury-Brown-Twiss measurements, an electron-heralded single-photon state is revealed via antibunching intensity correlations, while two-quantum energy losses of individual electrons yield pronounced two-photon coincidences. The approach facilitates the tailored preparation of higher-number Fock and other optical quantum states based on controlled interactions with free-electron beams.</description>

      <title>Synchronizable hybrid subsystem codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum synchronizable codes are quantum error correcting codes that can correct not only Pauli errors but also errors in block synchronization. The code can be constructed from two classical cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{D}$ satisfying $\mathcal{C}^{\perp} \subset \mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{D}$ through the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code construction. In this work, we establish connections between quantum synchronizable codes, subsystem codes, and hybrid codes constructed from the same pair of classical cyclic codes. We also propose a method to construct a synchronizable hybrid subsystem code which can correct both Pauli and synchronization errors, is resilient to gauge errors by virtue of the subsystem structure, and can transmit both classical and quantum information, all at the same time. The trade-offs between the number of synchronization errors that the code can correct, the number of gauge qubits, and the number of logical classical bits of the code are also established. In addition, we propose general methods to construct hybrid and hybrid subsystem codes of CSS type from classical codes, which cover relevant codes from our main construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication we demonstrate that a deep artificial neural network based on a transformer architecture with self-attention layers can predict the long-time population dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a dissipative environment provided that the short-time population dynamics of the system is known. The transformer neural network model developed in this work predicts the long-time dynamics of spin-boson model efficiently and very accurately across different regimes, from weak system-bath coupling to strong coupling non-Markovian regimes. Our model is more accurate than classical forecasting models, such as recurrent neural networks and is comparable to the state-of-the-art models for simulating the dynamics of quantum dissipative systems, based on kernel ridge regression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No-signaling is a consequence of the no-communication theorem that states that bipartite systems cannot transfer information
  unless a communication channel exists. It is also a by-product of the assumptions of Bell theorem about quantum nonlocality. We have tested no-signaling in bipartite systems of qubits from IBM Quantum devices in extremely large statistics, resulting in significant violations. Although the time and space scales of IBM Quantum cannot in principle rule out subluminal communications, there is no obvious physical mechanism leading to signaling. The violation is also at similar level as observed in Bell tests. It is therefore mandatory to check possible technical imperfections that may cause the violation and to repeat the loophole-free Bell test at much larger statistics, in order to be ruled out definitively at strict spacelike conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical lever is a precision displacement sensor with broad applications. In principle, it can track the motion of a mechanical oscillator with added noise at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL); however, demonstrating this performance requires an oscillator with an exceptionally high torque sensitivity, or, equivalently, zero-point angular displacement spectral density. Here, we describe optical lever measurements on Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbons possessing $Q&gt;3\times 10^7$ torsion modes with torque sensitivities of $10^{-20}\,\text{N m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and zero-point displacement spectral densities of $10^{-10}\,\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Compensating aberrations and leveraging immunity to classical intensity noise, we realize angular displacement measurements with imprecisions 20 dB below the SQL and demonstrate feedback cooling, using a position modulated laser beam as a torque actuator, from room temperature to $\sim5000$ phonons. Our study signals the potential for a new class of torsional quantum optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Immortal quantum correlation in quasiperiodic quasi-1D system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevailing view on long-range correlations is that they typically attenuate uniformly with distance and temperature, as most interactions either exhibit short-range dominance or decay following a power law. In contrast to this belief, this study demonstrates that the intricate interplay between quasiperiodicity and the quasi-1D nature of subbands can result in strong long-range coupling without attenuation, a phenomenon referred to as an immortal interaction. Exemplifying a periodically stacked Fibonacci chain, we uncover an immortal interaction with greatly enhanced, persistent long-range coupling. Using negativity, it is shown that this interaction creates stable entanglement that endures over long distances and remains robust at finite temperatures. Additionally, unconventional logarithmic scaling entanglement is revealed, deviating from the traditional area law. These findings offer quasiperiodic quasi-1D systems as a novel platform for sustaining stable entanglement across exceptionally long distances, even in the presence of finite temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Surface-mediated ultra-strong cavity coupling of two-dimensional itinerant electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering phases of matter in cavities requires effective light-matter coupling strengths that are on the same order of magnitude as the bare system energetics, coined the ultra-strong coupling regime. For models of itinerant electron systems, which do not have discrete energy levels, a clear definition of this regime is outstanding to date. Here we argue that a change of the electronic mass exceeding $10\%$ of its bare value may serve as such a definition. We propose a quantitative computational scheme for obtaining the electronic mass in relation to its bare vacuum value and show that coupling to surface polariton modes can induce such mass changes. Our results have important implications for cavity design principles that enable the engineering of electronic properties with quantum light.</description>

      <title>Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to 1d Poisson. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, and the statistics agrees with that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^\dag$. For large disorder, we recover the expected 2d Poisson statistics. Our analysis uses numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions of an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$, fitting them to the spin chain data. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices in class AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of Relativistic Quantum Scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scars refer to eigenstates with enhanced probability density along unstable classical periodic orbits (POs). First predicted 40 years ago, scars are special eigenstates that counterintuitively defy ergodicity in quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic. Despite the importance and long history of scars, their direct visualization in quantum systems remains an open field. Here we demonstrate that, by using an in-situ graphene quantum dot (GQD) creation and wavefunction mapping technique, quantum scars are imaged for Dirac electrons with nanometer spatial resolution and meV energy resolution with a scanning tunneling microscope. Specifically, we find enhanced probability densities in the form of lemniscate-shaped and streak-like patterns within our stadium-shaped GQDs. Both features show equal energy interval recurrence, consistent with predictions for relativistic quantum scars. By combining classical and quantum simulations, we demonstrate that the observed patterns correspond to two unstable POs that exist in our stadium-shaped GQD, thus proving they are both quantum scars. In addition to providing the first unequivocal visual evidence of quantum scarring, our work offers insight into the quantum-classical correspondence in relativistic chaotic quantum systems and paves the way to experimental investigation of other recently proposed scarring species such as perturbation-induced scars, chiral scars, and antiscarring.</description>

      <title>Lattice Light Shift Evaluations In a Dual-Ensemble Yb Optical Lattice Clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In state-of-the-art optical lattice clocks, beyond-electric-dipole polarizability terms lead to a break-down of magic wavelength trapping. In this Letter, we report a novel approach to evaluate lattice light shifts, specifically addressing recent discrepancies in the atomic multipolarizability term between experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. We combine imaging and multi-ensemble techniques to evaluate lattice light shift atomic coefficients, leveraging comparisons in a dual-ensemble lattice clock to rapidly evaluate differential frequency shifts. Further, we demonstrate application of a running wave field to probe both the multipolarizability and hyperpolarizability coefficients, establishing a new technique for future lattice light shift evaluations.</description>

      <title>Ideal flat and resolved SU(3) Landau levels in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are of great importance for understanding the quantum Hall effect and associated many-body physics. Recently, their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, i.e., dispersionless 3D LLs with well-defined quantum numbers, have attracted significant attention but have not yet been reported. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally observe 3D LLs with a sharply quantized spectrum in a diamond acoustic lattice, where the eigenstates are characterized by SU(3) quantum numbers. The engineered inhomogeneous hopping strengths not only introduce pseudomagnetic fields that quantize the nodal lines into LLs but also provide three bosonic degrees of freedom, embedding a generic SU(3) symmetry into the LLs. Using a phased array of acoustic sources, we selectively excite distinct eigenstates within the degenerate LL multiplets and visualize their 3D eigenmodes. Importantly, our approach enables the precise reconstruction of SU(3) quantum numbers directly from eigenmode correlations. Our results establish SU(3) LLs as a tractable model in artificial platforms, and pave the way for synthesizing LLs with zero dispersion and countable quantum numbers in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper pioneers the use of quantum machine learning (QML) for modeling the Ohmic contact process in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) for the first time. Utilizing data from 159 devices and variational auto-encoder-based augmentation, we developed a quantum kernel-based regressor (QKR) with a 2-level ZZ-feature map. Benchmarking against six classical machine learning (CML) models, our QKR consistently demonstrated the lowest mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Repeated statistical analysis confirmed its robustness. Additionally, experiments verified an MAE of 0.314 ohm-mm, underscoring the QKR's superior performance and potential for semiconductor applications, and demonstrating significant advancements over traditional CML methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the conventional Jarzynski equality does not hold for a system prepared in a microcanonical ensemble. We derive a modified equality that connects microcanonical work fluctuations to entropy production, in an analogous way to the Jarzynski equality, but with reference to an inverse temperature that depends on the path of the work protocol. Our result is a special case of a general expression for the microcanonical moment-generating function for any extensive quantity, which enables calculation of the breakdown of ensemble equivalence for thermodynamic fluctuations. We demonstrate our microcanonical Jarzynski equality in an ensemble of driven two-level systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum processors capable of handling practical fluid flow problems represents a distant yet promising frontier. Recent strides in quantum algorithms, particularly linear solvers, have illuminated the path toward quantum solutions for classical fluid flow solvers. However, assessing the capability of these quantum linear systems algorithms (QLSAs) in solving ideal flow equations on real hardware is crucial for their future development in practical fluid flow applications. In this study, we examine the capability of a canonical QLSA, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, in accurately solving the system of linear equations governing an idealized fluid flow problem, specifically the Hele-Shaw flow. Our investigation focuses on analyzing the accuracy and computational cost of the HHL solver. To gauge the stability and convergence of the solver, we conduct shots-based simulations on quantum simulators. Furthermore, we share insights gained from executing the HHL solver on superconducting quantum devices. To mitigate errors arising from qubit measurement, gate operations, and qubit decoherence inherent in quantum devices, we employ various error suppression and mitigation techniques. Our preliminary assessments serve as a foundational step towards enabling more complex quantum utility scale evaluation of using QLSA for solving fluid flow problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Range Reduction via Branch-and-Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-performance computing in machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to the development of specialized hardware accelerators like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A key strategy to enhance these accelerators is the reduction of precision in arithmetic operations, which increases processing speed and lowers latency - crucial for real-time AI applications. Precision reduction minimizes memory bandwidth requirements and energy consumption, essential for large-scale and mobile deployments, and increases throughput by enabling more parallel operations per cycle, maximizing hardware resource utilization. This strategy is equally vital for solving NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems common in machine learning, which often require high precision for accurate representation. Special hardware solvers, such as quantum annealers, benefit significantly from precision reduction. This paper introduces a fully principled Branch-and-Bound algorithm for reducing precision needs in QUBO problems by utilizing dynamic range as a measure of complexity. Experiments validate our algorithm's effectiveness on an actual quantum annealer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) has been used in fundamental studies on spins in quantum dots (QDs) and qubit readouts. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity of &lt;20 uT. Liftings of PSB by magnetic resonance are also observed at low temperatures. This unique system is expected to realize room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.</description>

Abstract: The Higgs boson, discovered back in 2012 through collision data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by ATLAS and CMS experiments, marked a significant inflection point in High Energy Physics (HEP). Today, it's crucial to precisely measure Higgs production processes with LHC experiments in order to gain insights into the universe and find any invisible physics. To analyze the vast data that LHC experiments generate, classical machine learning has become an invaluable tool. However, classical classifiers often struggle with detecting higgs production processes, leading to incorrect labeling of Higgs Bosons. This paper aims to tackle this classification problem by investigating the use of quantum machine learning (QML).</description>

Abstract: Study of phase transitions provide insights into how a many-body system behaves under different conditions, enabling us to understand the symmetry breaking, critical phenomena, and topological properties. Strong long-range interactions in highly excited Rydberg atoms create a versatile platform for exploring exotic emergent topological phases. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical topological phase transitions in cold Rydberg atomic gases under a microwave field driving. By measuring the system transmission curves while varying the probe intensity, we observe complex hysteresis trajectories characterized by distinct winding numbers as they cross the critical point. At the transition state, where the winding number flips, the topology of these hysteresis trajectories evolves into more non-trivial structures. The topological trajectories are shown to be robust against noise, confirming their rigidity in dynamic conditions. These findings contribute to the insights of emergence of complex dynamical topological phases in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose two distinct crosscap states for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising field theory. These two crosscap states, identifying Ising spins or dual spins (domain walls) at antipodal points, are shown to be related via the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. We derive their Majorana free field representations and extend bosonization techniques to calculate correlation functions of the 2D Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with different crosscap boundaries. We further develop a conformal perturbation theory to calculate the Klein bottle entropy as a universal scaling function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 151602 (2023)] in the 2D Ising field theory. The formalism developed in this work is applicable to many other 2D CFTs perturbed by relevant operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method to investigate in-situ light transport within optically thick ensembles of cold atoms, exploiting the internal structure of alkaline-earth metals. A method for creating an optical excitation at the center of a large atomic cloud is demonstrated, and we observe its propagation through multiple scattering events. In conditions where the cloud size is significantly larger than the transport mean free path, a diffusive regime is identified. We measure key parameters including the diffusion coefficient, transport velocity, and transport time, finding a good agreement with diffusion models. We also demonstrate that the frequency of the photons launched inside the system can be controlled. This approach enables direct time- and space-resolved observation of light diffusion in atomic ensembles, offering a promising avenue for exploring new diffusion regimes.</description>

Abstract: A recently introduced recurrence-relation ansatz applied to the Fermi-Hubbard model gives rise to a soluble model and here is used to calculate several thermodynamic observables. The constraint of unit density per site, density = 1, is applied and some of the results are compared to cases where the constraint is not imposed. The modified model exhibits a continuous phase transition (second order) reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall resistance and a ground state, first-order phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice is one of the simplest models for studying ferro-magnetic to para-magnetic transitions. Extensive results are available in the literature for this model, which has become a paradigm for the study of magnetic phase transitions in materials, both theoretically and numerically. After a brief review of the main results obtained with a classical computer, we show how to implement on the D- Wave quantum annealer a more complex Ising model with the addition of competing antiferromagnetic interactions between the diagonal next-to-nearest neighbors with two coupling constants J1 and J2. The dynamics of this system, owing to frustration, are richer than those of the simple Ising model and exhibit a third striped (or antiferromagnetic) phase in addition to the ferro- and para-magnetic phases. In this work, we observed all three phases on the D-Wave hardware, studied the behavior of the solution with different annealing parameters, such as the chain strength and annealing time, and showed how to identify the phase transition by varying the ratio between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings. The same system is studied on a classical computer, with the possibility of taking into account the temperature (fixed on D-Wave) as a free parameter and to explore the full phase diagram: some comparative conclusions with D-Wave are drawn.</description>

      <title>Flatbands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flatbands in anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians with an $E=0$ flatband by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flatbands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered $E=0$ flatbands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flatband eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flatband eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Two-Photon Absorption of Molecules through Efficient Optimization of Entangled Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report how the unique temporal and spectral features of pulsed entangled photons from a parametric downconversion source can be utilized for manipulating electronic excitations through the optimization of their spectral phase. A new comprehensive optimization protocol based on Bayesian optimization has been developed in this work to selectively excite electronic states accessible by two-photon absorption. Using our optimization method, the entangled two-photon absorption probability for a thiophene dendrimer can be enhanced by up to a factor of 20 while classical light turns out to be nonoptimizable. Moreover, the optimization involving photon entanglement enables selective excitation that would not be possible otherwise. In addition to optimization, we have explored entangled two-photon absorption in the small entanglement time limit showing that entangled light can excite molecular electronic states that are vanishingly small for classical light. We demonstrate these opportunities with an application to a thiophene dendrimer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.00292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a quantum heat engine described by the full Dicke model. The system exhibit quantum phase transitions under certain conditions. We consider the system performing a Stirling thermodynamic cycle. We obtain an enhancement of efficiency when during the cycle the coupling parameter cross a critical value. We analyze the effect of unbalance between rotating and counter-rotating terms in the model. The maximum efficiency is obtained when the contributions of the counter-rotating and rotating terms are equal. The relation between ground state degeneracy, related to the quantum phase transition, and maximum efficiency is investigated.</description>

      <title>A Semantics for Counterfactuals in Quantum Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism for the evaluation of counterfactual queries in the framework of quantum causal models, generalising Pearl's semantics for counterfactuals in classical causal models, thus completing the last rung in the quantum analogue of Pearl's "ladder of causation". To this end, we define a suitable extension of Pearl's notion of a 'classical structural causal model', which we denote analogously by 'quantum structural causal model', and a corresponding extension of Pearl's three-step procedure of abduction, action, and prediction. We show that every classical (probabilistic) structural causal model can be extended to a quantum structural causal model, and prove that counterfactual queries that can be formulated within a classical structural causal model agree with their corresponding queries in the quantum extension -- but the latter is more expressive. Counterfactuals in quantum causal models come in different forms: we distinguish between active and passive counterfactual queries, depending on whether or not an intervention is to be performed in the action step. This is in contrast to the classical case, where counterfactuals are always interpreted in the active sense. Another distinctive feature of our formalism is that it breaks the connection between causal and counterfactual dependence that exists in the classical case: quantum counterfactuals allow for counterfactual dependence without causal dependence. This distinction between classical and quantum causal models may shed light on how the latter can reproduce quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities while being faithful to the relativistic causal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) -- one of the leading algorithms for applications on intermediate-scale quantum processors -- is designed to provide approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems with shallow quantum circuits. Here, we study QAOA implementations with cat qubits, using coherent states with opposite amplitudes. The dominant noise mechanism, i.e., photon losses, results in $Z$-biased noise with this encoding. We consider in particular an implementation with Kerr resonators. We numerically simulate solving MaxCut problems using QAOA with cat qubits by simulating the required gates sequence acting on the Kerr non-linear resonators, and compare to the case of standard qubits, encoded in ideal two-level systems, in the presence of single-photon loss. Our results show that running QAOA with cat qubits increases the approximation ratio for random instances of MaxCut with respect to qubits encoded into two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Bell-state transfer via dissipative Liouvillian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral state transfer along closed loops in the vicinity of an exceptional point is one of the many counter-intuitive observations in non-Hermitian physics. The application of this property beyond proof-of-principle in quantum physics, is an open question. In this work, we demonstrate chiral state conversion between singlet and triplet Bell states through fully-quantum Liouvillian dynamics. Crucially, we demonstrate that this property can be used for the chiral production of Bell states from separable states with a high fidelity and for a large range of parameters. Additionally, we show that the removal of quantum jumps from the dynamics through postselection can result in near-perfect Bell states from initially separable states. Our work presents the first application of chiral state transfer in quantum information processing and demonstrates a novel way to control entangled states by means of dissipation engineering.</description>

      <title>The Tensor as an Informational Resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tensor is a multidimensional array of numbers that can be used to store data, encode a computational relation and represent quantum entanglement. In this sense a tensor can be viewed as valuable resource whose transformation can lead to an understanding of structure in data, computational complexity and quantum information.
  In order to facilitate the understanding of this resource, we propose a family of information-theoretically constructed preorders on tensors, which can be used to compare tensors with each other and to assess the existence of transformations between them. The construction places copies of a given tensor at the edges of a hypergraph and allows transformations at the vertices. A preorder is then induced by the transformations possible in a given growing sequence of hypergraphs. The new family of preorders generalises the asymptotic restriction preorder which Strassen defined in order to study the computational complexity of matrix multiplication.
  We derive general properties of the preorders and their associated asymptotic notions of tensor rank and view recent results on tensor rank non-additivity, tensor networks and algebraic complexity in this unifying frame. We hope that this work will provide a useful vantage point for exploring tensors in applied mathematics, physics and computer science, but also from a purely mathematical point of view.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents strategies to improve the performance of digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization algorithms by cooptimizing gate sequences, algorithm parameters, and qubit mapping. Demonstrations on near-term quantum devices validate the effectiveness of these strategies, leveraging both algorithmic and hardware advantages. Our approach increases the approximation ratio by an average of 4.49$\times$ without error mitigation and 84.8% with error mitigation, while reducing CX gate count and circuit depth by 28.8% and 33.4%, respectively, compared to Qiskit and Tket. These findings provide valuable insights into the codesign of algorithm implementation, tailored to optimize qubit mapping and algorithm parameters, with broader implications for enhancing algorithm performance on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Applying an Evolutionary Algorithm to Minimize Teleportation Costs in Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By connecting multiple quantum computers (QCs) through classical and quantum channels, a quantum communication network can be formed. This gives rise to new applications such as blind quantum computing, distributed quantum computing, and quantum key distribution. In distributed quantum computing, QCs collectively perform a quantum computation. As each device only executes a sub-circuit with fewer qubits than required by the complete circuit, a number of small QCs can be used in combination to execute a large quantum circuit that a single QC could not solve on its own. However, communication between QCs may still occur. Depending on the connectivity of the circuit, qubits must be teleported to different QCs in the network, adding overhead to the actual computation; thus, it is crucial to minimize the number of teleportations. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm for this problem. More specifically, the algorithm assigns qubits to QCs in the network for each time step of the circuit such that the overall teleportation cost is minimized. Moreover, network-specific constraints such as the capacity of each QC in the network can be taken into account. We run experiments on random as well as benchmarking circuits and give an outline on how this method can be adjusted to be incorporated into more realistic network settings as well as in compilers for distributed quantum computing. Our results show that an evolutionary algorithm is well suited for this problem when compared to the graph partitioning approach as it delivers better results while simultaneously allows the easy integration and consideration of various problem-specific constraints.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Phase Estimation with Squeezed Vacuum Approaching the Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase estimation plays a central role in communications, sensing, and information processing. Quantum correlated states, such as squeezed states, enable phase estimation beyond the shot-noise limit, and in principle approach the ultimate quantum limit in precision, when paired with optimal quantum measurements. However, physical realizations of optimal quantum measurements for optical phase estimation with quantum-correlated states are still unknown. Here we address this problem by introducing an adaptive Gaussian measurement strategy for optical phase estimation with squeezed vacuum states that, by construction, approaches the quantum limit in precision. This strategy builds from a comprehensive set of locally optimal POVMs through rotations and homodyne measurements and uses the Adaptive Quantum State Estimation framework for optimizing the adaptive measurement process, which, under certain regularity conditions, guarantees asymptotic optimality for this quantum parameter estimation problem. As a result, the adaptive phase estimation strategy based on locally-optimal homodyne measurements achieves the quantum limit within the phase interval of $[0, \pi/2)$. Furthermore, we generalize this strategy by including heterodyne measurements, enabling phase estimation across the full range of phases from $[0, \pi)$, where squeezed vacuum allows for unambiguous phase encoding. Remarkably, for this phase interval, which is the maximum range of phases that can be encoded in squeezed vacuum, this estimation strategy maintains an asymptotic quantum-optimal performance, representing a significant advancement in quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary designs are widely used in quantum computation, but in many practical settings it suffices to construct a diagonal state design generated with unitary gates diagonal in the computational basis. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient diagonal state design based on real-time evolutions. Our construction is inspired by the classical Girard-Hutchinson trace estimator in that it involves the stochastic preparation of random-phase states. Although the exact Girard-Hutchinson states are not tractably implementable on a quantum computer, we can construct states that match the statistical moments of the Girard-Hutchinson states with real-time evolution. Importantly, our random states are all generated using the same Hamiltonians for real-time evolution, with the randomness arising solely from stochastic variations in the durations of the evolutions. In this sense, the circuit is fully reconfigurable and thus suited for near-term realizations on both digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore covert communication of qubits over the lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, which is a quantum-mechanical model of many practical channels, including optical. Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show a \emph{square root law} (SRL) for quantum covert communication similar to that for classical: $\propto\sqrt{n}$ qubits can be transmitted covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of an optical channel. Our achievability proof uses photonic dual-rail qubit encoding, which has been proposed for long-range repeater-based quantum communication and entanglement distribution. Our converse employs prior covert signal power limit results and adapts well-known methods to upper bound quantum capacity of optical channels. Finally, we believe that the gap between our lower and upper bounds for the number of reliable covert qubits can be mitigated by improving the quantum error correction codes and quantum channel capacity bounds.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Oscillators and Qudits with Distributed Two-Mode Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes have shown great promise in enhancing the protection of both discrete and analog quantum information. This broadened range of protection brings opportunities beyond quantum computing to benefit quantum sensing by safeguarding squeezing -- the essential resource in many quantum metrology protocols. However, the potential for quantum sensing to benefit quantum error correction has been less explored. In this work, we provide a unique example where techniques from quantum sensing can be applied to improve multi-mode GKP codes. Inspired by distributed quantum sensing, we propose the distributed two-mode squeezing (dtms) GKP codes that offer benefits in error correction with minimal active encoding operations. Indeed, the proposed codes rely on a single (active) two-mode squeezing element and an array of beamsplitters that effectively distributes continuous-variable correlations to many GKP ancillae, similar to continuous-variable distributed quantum sensing. Despite this simple construction, the code distance achievable with dtms-GKP qubit codes is comparable to previous results obtained through brute-force numerical search [PRX Quantum 4, 040334 (2023)]. Moreover, these codes enable analog noise suppression beyond that of the best-known two-mode codes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 080503 (2020)] without requiring an additional squeezer. We also provide a simple two-stage decoder for the proposed codes, which appears near-optimal for the case of two modes and permits analytical evaluation.</description>

      <title>Improving threshold for fault-tolerant color code quantum computing by flagged weight optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color codes are promising quantum error correction (QEC) codes because they have an advantage over surface codes in that all Clifford gates can be implemented transversally. However, thresholds of color codes under circuit-level noise are relatively low mainly because measurements of their high-weight stabilizer generators cause an increase in a circuit depth, and thus, substantial errors are introduced. This makes color codes not the best candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we propose a method to suppress the impact of such errors by optimizing weights of decoders using conditional error probabilities conditioned on the measurement outcomes of flag qubits. In numerical simulations, we improve the threshold of the (4.8.8) color code under circuit-level noise from 0.14% to around 0.27%, which is calculated by using an integer programming decoder. Furthermore, in the (6.6.6) color code, we achieve a circuit-level threshold of around 0.36%, which is almost the same value as the highest value in the previous studies employing the same noise model. In both cases, an effective code distance is also improved compared to a conventional method that uses a single ancilla qubit for each stabilizer measurement. Thereby, the achieved logical error rates at low physical error rates are almost one order of magnitude lower than those of the conventional method with the same code distance. Even when compared to the single ancilla method with higher code distance, considering the increased number of qubits used in our method, we achieve lower logical error rates in most cases. This method can also be applied to other weight-based decoders, making the color codes more promising for the candidate of experimental implementation of QEC. Furthermore, one can utilize this approach to improve a threshold of wider classes of QEC codes, such as high-rate quantum low-density parity check codes.</description>

      <title>Super-dephasing in Collective Atom-Atom Interactions Mediated by Near-Field Electromagnetic Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate transmission-based dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit using an all-pass resonator, which preferentially emits readout photons toward the output. This is in contrast to typical readout schemes, which intentionally mismatch the feedline at one end so that the readout signal preferentially decays toward the output. We show that this intentional mismatch creates scaling challenges, including larger spread of effective resonator linewidths due to non-ideal impedance environments and added infrastructure for impedance matching. A future architecture using multiplexed all-pass readout resonators would avoid the need for intentional mismatch and potentially improve the scaling prospects of quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of "all-pass readout," we design and fabricate an all-pass readout resonator that demonstrates insertion loss below 1.17 dB at the readout frequency and a maximum insertion loss of 1.53 dB across its full bandwidth for the lowest three states of a transmon qubit. We demonstrate qubit readout with an average single-shot fidelity of 98.1% in 600 ns; to assess the effect of larger dispersive shift, we implement a shelving protocol and achieve a fidelity of 99.0% in 300 ns.</description>

      <title>Computational Electromagnetics Meets Spin Qubits: Controlling Noise Effects in Quantum Sensing and Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state spin qubits have emerged as promising platforms for quantum information. Despite extensive efforts in controlling noise in spin qubit quantum applications, one important but less controlled noise source is near-field electromagnetic fluctuations. Low-frequency (MHz and GHz) electromagnetic fluctuations are significantly enhanced near lossy material components in quantum applications, including metallic/superconducting gates necessary for controlling spin qubits in quantum computing devices and materials/nanostructures to be probed in quantum sensing. Although controlling this low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuation noise is crucial for improving the performance of quantum devices, current efforts are hindered by computational challenges. In this paper, we leverage advanced computational electromagnetics techniques, especially fast and accurate volume integral equation based solvers, to overcome the computational obstacle. We introduce a quantum computational electromagnetics framework to control low-frequency magnetic fluctuation noise and enhance spin qubit device performance. Our framework extends the application of computational electromagnetics to spin qubit quantum devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our framework in realistic quantum devices. Our work paves the way for device engineering to control magnetic fluctuations and improve the performance of spin qubit quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Polarization Entanglement with highly non-degenerate photon pairs enhanced by effective walk-off compensation method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate polarization entanglement in highly non-degenerate photon pairs, generated through Type-0 spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) using bulk periodically poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystals. Through the utilization of both a beam displacer interferometer scheme and a Sagnac interferometer, we ensure high polarisation contrast and stable interference of the highly non-degenerate photon pairs, which however causes substantial spatial and temporal walk-offs of the photon paths which poses a formidable challenge. We introduce an effective compensation method using birefringent crystal wedges to eliminate spatial and temporal walkoffs simultaneously. This method is implemented in our entangled photon source (EPS) designed specifically for testing entanglement-based quantum key distribution (EBQKD) between ground and satellite, as part of the Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission funded by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). We observed a coincidence rate of N = (33.33+-0.05)kHz, a significant improvement compared to the absence of the spatial compensation. We also observed an estimated pair generation rate of (2.92+-0.12)MHz and an entanglement visibility of (96.6+-0.3)% from only 1.0mW of pump power, making it a promising source for long-distance quantum communication for ground-to-satellite and fiber optic links.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of accelerating incompressible computational fluid dynamics simulations with fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across industries, traditional design and engineering workflows are being upgraded to simulation-driven processes. Many workflows include computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Simulations of turbulent flow are notorious for high compute costs and reliance on approximate methods that compromise accuracy. Improvements in the speed and accuracy of CFD calculations would potentially reduce design workflow costs by reducing computational costs and eliminating the need for experimental testing. This study explores the feasibility of using fault-tolerant quantum computers to improve the speed and accuracy of CFD simulations in the incompressible or weakly compressible regime. For the example of simulation-driven ship design, we consider simulations for calculating the drag force in steady-state flows, and provide analysis on economic utility and classical hardness. As a waypoint toward assessing the feasibility of our chosen quantum approach, we estimate the quantum resources required for the simpler case of drag force on a sphere. We estimate the product of (logical qubits)$\times$($T$ gates) to range from $10^{22}$ to $10^{28}$. These high initial estimates suggest that future quantum computers are unlikely to provide utility for incompressible CFD applications unless significant algorithmic advancements or alternative quantum approaches are developed. Encouraged by applications in quantum chemistry that have realized orders-of-magnitude improvements as they matured, we identify the most promising next steps for quantum resource reduction as we work to scale up our estimates from spheres to utility-scale problems with more complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Four-qubit photonic system for publicly verifiable quantum random numbers and generation of public and private key</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate the use of a configurable four-qubit photonic system to generate a publicly verifiable quantum random numbers, to perform entanglement verification, and to generate secure public and private key. Quantum circuits, to generate the desired four-qubit states and its experimental realization in the photonic architecture is carried out using photon pairs entangled in polarization and path degree of freedom. By performing measurements on the four-qubit system and accessing partial information of the four-qubit state for public verification, we generate publicly verified and purely secured random bits at the rate of 185 kbps from collective data of 370 kbps. When the system is used for generating public and private keys, an equal number of public and private keys are generated simultaneously. We also record about 97.9% of sampled bits from four-qubit states passing entanglement verification and demonstrate the use of public and private key generated for image encryption-decryption. The theoretical model of noise on the four-qubit state and its effect on the generation rate of verified and secured bits are in perfect agreement with the experimental results. This demonstrates the practical use of the small-scale multi-qubit photonic system for quantum-safe applications by providing the option for real-time verification of the security feature of the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Contextuality in anomalous heat flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical thermodynamics, heat must spontaneously flow from hot to cold systems. In quantum thermodynamics, the same law applies when considering multipartite product thermal states evolving unitarily. If initial correlations are present, anomalous heat flow can happen, temporarily making cold thermal states colder and hot thermal states hotter. Such effect can happen due to entanglement, but also because of classical randomness, hence lacking a direct connection with nonclassicality. In this work, we introduce scenarios where anomalous heat flow \emph{does} have a direct link to nonclassicality, defined to be the failure of noncontextual models to explain experimental data. We start by extending known noncontextuality inequalities to a setup where sequential transformations are considered. We then show a class of quantum prepare-transform-measure protocols, characterized by time intervals $(0,\tau_c)$ for a given critical time $\tau_c$, where anomalous heat flow happens only if a noncontextuality inequality is violated. We also analyze a recent experiment from Micadei et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2456 (2019)] and find the critical time $\tau_c$ based on their experimental parameters. We conclude by investigating heat flow in the evolution of two qutrit systems, showing that our findings are not an artifact of using two-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Photon Statistics from Non-Hermitian Floquet Theory: High Harmonic Generation and Above-Threshold Ionization Spectra Detected via IR Detectors</title>

Abstract: Although it seems that obtaining quantum properties of light from classical calculations is a self-contradictory claim, it is shown here that a unified mechanism governs the three distinct measurements of high harmonic generation spectra (HGS), above-threshold ionization (ATI), and IR photon number distribution, none of which require the quantization of the electromagnetic field. Here, the conditions that enable the calculations of HGS and ATI spectra for atoms interacting with high-intensity laser fields from photon statistics are first derived. Through the non-Hermitian theoretical simulation, the regimes where there is correspondence between the HHG and ATI spectra and annihilated pump photons (with post-selection) are identified. Consequently, the HGS and ATI spectra, as detected by XUV detectors, can be obtained by monitoring the fluctuations of the infrared absorbed photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to classical optical coherence theory based on Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and Glauber's quantum optical coherence theory based on matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics, quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics provides a novel tool to study optical coherence. It has the advantage of understanding the connection between mathematical calculations and physical interpretations better. Quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's path integral is introduced and reviewed in this paper. Based on the results of transient first-order interference of two independent light beams, it is predicted that the classical model for electric field of thermal light introduced by classical optical textbooks may not be accurate. The physics of two-photon bunching of thermal light and Hong-Ou-Mandel dip of entangled photon pairs is the same, which can be interpreted by constructive and destructive two-photon interference, respectively. Quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's path integral is helpful to understand the coherence properties of light, which may eventually lead us to the answer of the question: what is a photon?</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits provide a promising approach to large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, qubit connectivity on a planar surface is typically restricted to only a few neighboring qubits. Achieving longer-range and more flexible connectivity, which is particularly appealing in light of recent developments in error-correcting codes, however usually involves complex multi-layer packaging and external cabling, which is resource-intensive and can impose fidelity limitations. Here, we propose and realize a high-speed on-chip quantum processor that supports reconfigurable all-to-all coupling with a large on-off ratio. We implement the design in a four-node quantum processor, built with a modular design comprising a wiring substrate coupled to two separate qubit-bearing substrates, each including two single-qubit nodes. We use this device to demonstrate reconfigurable controlled-Z gates across all qubit pairs, with a benchmarked average fidelity of $96.00\%\pm0.08\%$ and best fidelity of $97.14\%\pm0.07\%$, limited mainly by dephasing in the qubits. We also generate multi-qubit entanglement, distributed across the separate modules, demonstrating GHZ-3 and GHZ-4 states with fidelities of $88.15\%\pm0.24\%$ and $75.18\%\pm0.11\%$, respectively. This approach promises efficient scaling to larger-scale quantum circuits, and offers a pathway for implementing quantum algorithms and error correction schemes that benefit from enhanced qubit connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have made it possible to implement logical multi-qubit transversal gates on surface codes in a multitude of platforms. A transversal controlled-NOT (tCNOT) gate on two surface codes introduces correlated errors across the code blocks and thus requires modified decoding strategies compared to established methods of decoding surface code quantum memory (SCQM) or lattice surgery operations. In this work, we examine and benchmark the performance of three different decoding strategies for the tCNOT for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation. In particular, we present a low-complexity decoder based on minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) that achieves the same threshold as the SCQM MWPM decoder. We extend our analysis with a study of tailored decoding of a transversal teleportation circuit, along with a comparison between the performance of lattice surgery and transversal operations under Pauli and erasure noise models. Our investigation works towards systematic estimation of the cost of implementing large-scale quantum algorithms based on transversal gates in the surface code.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions offer profound insights into fundamental quantum phenomena and enhance our understanding of complex materials and systems. However, identifying quantum phase transitions in the absence of conventional order parameters poses a significant challenge. To address this, we utilize reduced fidelity susceptibility (RFS) vector field to construct phase diagrams of various quantum systems and then demonstrate its efficacy in reproducing the phase diagrams of established models with known order parameter. To this end, we propose a new method for discovering the necessary order parameters for a given quantum model and illustrate its capability by identifying a suitable order parameter for the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Interaction (ANNNI) Model. Our analysis, which includes decomposing the observable into its eigen-projectors alongside the finite-size scaling, confirms that our method successfully can determine order parameters and thus its capable of characterizing quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

      <title>Competing topological phases in a non-Hermitian time-reversal symmetry-broken Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, which serves as a cornerstone in the study of the quantum spin Hall insulators, showcases robust spin-filtered helical edge states in a nanoribbon geometry. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, these (first-order) helical states gap out to be replaced by second-order corner states under suitable open-boundary conditions. Here, we show that the inclusion of a spin-dependent non-Hermitian balanced gain/loss potential induces a competition between these first and second-order topological phases. Surprisingly, the previously dormant first-order helical edge states in the nanoribbon resurface as the non-Hermitian effect intensifies, effectively neutralizing the role played by the magnetic field. By employing the projected spin spectra and the spin Chern number, we conclusively explain the resurgence of the first-order topological properties in the time-reversal symmetry-broken BHZ model in presence of non-Hermiticity. Finally, the biorthogonal spin-resolved Berry phase, exhibiting a non-trivial winding, definitively establishes the topological nature of these revived edge states, emphasizing the dominance of non-Hermiticity over the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Fast characterization of multiplexed single-electron pumps with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient machine learning based automated framework for the fast tuning of single-electron pump devices into current quantization regimes. It uses a sparse measurement approach based on an iterative active learning algorithm to take targeted measurements in the gate voltage parameter space. When compared to conventional parameter scans, our automated framework allows us to decrease the number of measurement points by about an order of magnitude. This corresponds to an eight-fold decrease in the time required to determine quantization errors, which are estimated via an exponential extrapolation of the first current plateau embedded into the algorithm. We show the robustness of the framework by characterizing 28 individual devices arranged in a GaAs/AlGaAs multiplexer array, which we use to identify a subset of devices suitable for parallel operation at communal gate voltages. The method opens up the possibility to efficiently scale the characterization of such multiplexed devices to a large number of pumps.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>2500 vibronic eigenstates of the NO$_3$ radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrate radical NO$_3$ plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, yet many aspects of its coupled and anharmonic vibronic structure remain elusive. Here, using an accurate, coupled full-dimensional diabatic potential that includes five electronic states, we revisit the vibronic spectrum associated with the electronic $\tilde X ^2A_2'$ state. Using recently developed tensor network state methods, we are able to compute more than 2500 vibronic states, thereby increasing the number of computed full-dimensional states by a factor of 50, compared to previous work. While we obtain good agreement with experiment for most of the assigned vibronic levels, for several others, we observe striking disagreement. Further, for the antisymmetric bending motion we find remarkably large symmetry-induced level splittings that are larger than the zero-order reference. We discuss non-negligible nonadiabatic effects and show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to significant errors in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Measurement resolution enhanced coherence for lattice fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.</description>
