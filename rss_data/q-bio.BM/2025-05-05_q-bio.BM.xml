      <title>p2smi: A Python Toolkit for Peptide FASTA-to-SMILES Conversion and Molecular Property Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting peptide sequences into useful representations for downstream analysis is a common step in computational modeling and cheminformatics. Furthermore, peptide drugs (e.g., Semaglutide, Degarelix) often take advantage of the diverse chemistries found in noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs), altered stereochemistry, and backbone modifications. Despite there being several chemoinformatics toolkits, none are tailored to the task of converting a modified peptide from an amino acid representation to the chemical string nomenclature Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES), often used in chemical modeling. Here we present p2smi, a Python toolkit with CLI, designed to facilitate the conversion of peptide sequences into chemical SMILES strings. By supporting both cyclic and linear peptides, including those with NCAAs, p2smi enables researchers to generate accurate SMILES strings for drug-like peptides, reducing the overhead for computational modeling and cheminformatics analyses. The toolkit also offers functionalities for chemical modification, synthesis feasibility evaluation, and calculation of molecular properties such as hydrophobicity, topological polar surface area, molecular weight, and adherence to Lipinski's rules for drug-likeness.</description>

      <title>Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration for Proteins (SAGE-Prot): A Framework for Multi-Objective Protein Optimization via Iterative Sequence Generation and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins play essential roles in nature, from catalyzing biochemical reactions to binding specific targets. Advances in protein engineering have the potential to revolutionize biotechnology and healthcare by designing proteins with tailored properties. Machine learning and generative models have transformed protein design by enabling the exploration of vast sequence-function landscapes. Here, we introduce Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration for Proteins (SAGE-Prot), a framework that iteratively combines autoregressive protein generation with quantitative structure-property relationship models for fine-tuned optimization. By integrating diverse protein descriptors, SAGE-Prot enhances key properties, including binding affinity, thermal stability, enzymatic activity, and solubility. We demonstrate its effectiveness by optimizing GB1 for binding affinity and thermal stability and TEM-1 for enzymatic activity and solubility. Leveraging curriculum learning, SAGE-Prot adapts rapidly to increasingly complex design objectives, building on past successes. Experimental validation demonstrated that SAGE-Prot-generated proteins substantially outperformed their wild-type counterparts, achieving up to a 17-fold increase in beta-lactamase activity, underscoring SAGE-Prot's potential to tackle critical challenges in protein engineering. As generative models continue to evolve, approaches like SAGE-Prot will be indispensable for advancing rational protein design.</description>
