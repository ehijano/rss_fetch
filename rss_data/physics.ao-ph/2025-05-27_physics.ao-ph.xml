      <title>NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation is critically important for marine research, yet remains challenging due to its substantial thermal inertia and extended time delay. Machine learning (ML)-based models have demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean simulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the slow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural ocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive graph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with ocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework tailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex dynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling relationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S and extreme event simulation.

      <title>Spatial verification of global precipitation forecasts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verification of global high-resolution precipitation forecasts is challenging. Spatial verification techniques address some shortcomings of traditional verification. However most existing methods do not account for the non-planar geometry of a global domain, or their computational complexity is too large for global assessments. We present an adaptation of the recently developed Precipitation Attribution Distance (PAD) metric, designed for verifying precipitation, enabling its use on the Earth's spherical geometry. PAD estimates the magnitude of location errors in the forecasts employing the mathematical theory of Optimal Transport, as it provides a close upper bound for the Wasserstein distance. The method is fast and flexible with time complexity $O(n \log(n))$. Its behavior is analyzed using idealized cases and 7 years of operational global deterministic 6-hourly precipitation forecasts from the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The summary results for the whole period show how location errors in the IFS model grow steadily with increasing lead time for all analyzed regions. Moreover, by examining the time-series of the results, we can determine the trends in the score's value and identify the regions where there is a statistically significant improvement (or worsening) of the forecast performance. The results can also be analyzed separately for different intensities of precipitation. Overall, the PAD provides meaningful results for estimating location errors in global high-resolution precipitation forecasts at an affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of turbulence in convectively unstable internal solitary waves of depression shoaling over gentle slopes in the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shoaling of high-amplitude Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) of depression in the South China Sea (SCS) is examined through large-scale parallel turbulence-resolving high-accuracy/resolution simulations. A select, near-isobath-normal, bathymetric transect of the gentle SCS continental slope is employed together with stratification and current profiles obtained by in-situ measurements. Three simulations of separate ISWs with initial deep-water amplitudes in the range [136m, 150m] leverage a novel wave-tracking capability for a propagation distance of 80km and accurately reproduce key features of in-situ-observed phenomena with significantly higher spatiotemporal resolution. The interplay between convective and shear instability and the associated turbulence formation and evolution, as a function of deep-water ISW amplitude are further studied in-part revealing processes previously not observed in the field. Across all three waves, the convective instability develops in a similar fashion. Heavier water entrained from the wave rear plunges into its interior, giving rise to transient, yet distinct, subsurface vortical structures. Ultimately, a gravity current is triggered which horizontally advances through the wave interior and mixes it down to pycnocline's base. Although the waveform remains distinctly symmetric, Kelvin-Helmholtz billows emerge near the well-mixed ISW trough, disturb the wave's trailing edge and give rise to an active wake. The evolution of the kinetic energy associated with finer-scale perturbations to the ISW-induced velocity field shows two different growth regimes, each dominated by either convective or shear instability. The wake's perturbation kinetic energy is nonlinearly dependent on deep-water wave amplitude and can become a sizable fraction of the kinetic energy of the deep-water ISW.</description>

      <title>Applying the ACE2 Emulator to SST Green's Functions for the E3SMv3 Global Atmosphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Green's functions are a useful technique for interpreting atmospheric state responses to changes in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST). Here we train version 2 of the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE2) on reference historical SST simulations of the US Department of Energy's EAMv3 global atmosphere model. We compare how well the SST Green's functions generated by ACE2 match those of EAMv3, following the protocol of the Green's Function Model Intercomparison Project (GFMIP). The spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative response from the individual GFMIP SST patch simulations are similar for ACE and the EAMv3 reference. The derived sensitivity of global net TOA radiation sensitivity to SST patch location is qualitatively similar in ACE as in EAMv3, but there are statistically significant discrepancies for some SST patches, especially over the subtropical northeast Pacific. These discrepancies may reflect insufficient diversity in the SST patterns sampled over the course of the EAMv3 AMIP simulation used for training ACE. Both ACE and EAMv3 Green's functions reconstruct the historical record of the global annual-mean TOA radiative flux from a reference EAMv3 AMIP simulation reasonably well. Notably, under our configuration and compute resources, ACE achieves these results approximately 100 times faster in wall-clock time compared to EAMv3, highlighting its potential as a powerful and efficient tool for tackling other computationally intensive problems in climate science.</description>
