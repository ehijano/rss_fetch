      <title>Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment in Education for Trustworthy Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education, offering unprecedented opportunities to personalize learning, enhance assessment, and support educators. Yet these opportunities also introduce risks related to equity, privacy, and student autonomy. This chapter develops the concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment in education, emphasizing that trustworthy learning environments arise not only from embedding human values into AI systems but also from equipping teachers, students, and institutions with the skills to interpret, critique, and guide these technologies. Drawing on emerging research and practical case examples, we explore AI's evolution from support tool to collaborative partner, highlighting its impacts on teacher roles, student agency, and institutional governance. We propose actionable strategies for policymakers, developers, and educators to ensure that AI advances equity, transparency, and human flourishing rather than eroding them. By reframing AI adoption as an ongoing process of mutual adaptation, the chapter envisions a future in which humans and intelligent systems learn, innovate, and grow together.</description>

      <title>Agent-based simulation of online social networks and disinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on online social networks (OSNs) is often hindered by platform opacity, limited access to data, and ethical constraints. Simulation offer a valuable alternative, but existing frameworks frequently lack realism and explainability. This paper presents a simulation framework that models synthetic social networks with agents endowed with demographic-based personality traits and finite-state behavioral automata, enabling realistic and interpretable actions. A generative module powered by a large language model (LLM) produces context-aware social media posts consistent with each agent's profile and memory. In parallel, a red module implements DISARM-inspired workflows to orchestrate disinformation campaigns executed by malicious agents targeting simulated audiences. A Mastodon-based visualization layer supports real-time inspection and post-hoc validation of agent activity within a familiar interface. We evaluate the resulting synthetic social networks using topological metrics and LLM-based content assessments, demonstrating structural, behavioral, and linguistic realism. Overall, the framework enables the creation of customizable and controllable social network environments for studying information dynamics and the effects of disinformation.</description>

      <title>SENTINEL: A Multi-Modal Early Detection Framework for Emerging Cyber Threats using Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyberattacks pose a serious threat to modern sociotechnical systems, often resulting in severe technical and societal consequences. Attackers commonly target systems and infrastructure through methods such as malware, ransomware, or other forms of technical exploitation. Most traditional mechanisms to counter these threats rely on post-hoc detection and mitigation strategies, responding to cyber incidents only after they occur rather than preventing them proactively. Recent trends reveal social media discussions can serve as reliable indicators for detecting such threats. Malicious actors often exploit online platforms to distribute attack tools, share attack knowledge and coordinate. Experts too, often predict ongoing attacks and discuss potential breaches in online spaces. In this work, we present SENTINEL, a framework that leverages social media signals for early detection of cyber attacks. SENTINEL aligns cybersecurity discussions to realworld cyber attacks leveraging multi modal signals, i.e., combining language modeling through large language models and coordination markers through graph neural networks. We use data from 16 public channels on Telegram related to cybersecurity and open source intelligence (OSINT) that span 365k messages. We highlight that social media discussions involve active dialogue around cyber threats and leverage SENTINEL to align the signals to real-world threats with an F1 of 0.89. Our work highlights the importance of leveraging language and network signals in predicting online threats.</description>

      <title>ALETHEIA: Combating Social Media Influence Campaigns with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence campaigns are a growing concern in the online spaces. Policymakers, moderators and researchers have taken various routes to fight these campaigns and make online systems safer for regular users. To this end, our paper presents ALETHEIA, a system that formalizes the detection of malicious accounts (or troll accounts) used in such operations and forecasts their behaviors within social media networks. We analyze influence campaigns on Reddit and X from different countries and highlight that detection pipelines built over a graph-based representation of campaigns using a mix of topological and linguistic features offer improvement over standard interaction and user features. ALETHEIA uses state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for detecting malicious users that can scale to large networks and achieve a 3.7% F1-score improvement over standard classification with interaction features in prior work. Furthermore, ALETHEIA employs a first temporal link prediction mechanism built for influence campaigns by stacking a GNN over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which can predict future troll interactions towards other trolls and regular users with an average AUC of 96.6%. ALETHEIA predicts troll-to-troll edges (TTE) and troll-to-user edges (TUE), which can help identify regular users being affected by malicious influence efforts. Overall, our results highlight the importance of utilizing the networked nature of influence operations (i.e., structural information) when predicting and detecting malicious coordinated activity in online spaces.</description>

      <title>Compliance Rating Scheme: A Data Provenance Framework for Generative AI Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has experienced exponential growth in recent years, partly facilitated by the abundance of large-scale open-source datasets. These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.</description>

      <title>On The Conceptualization and Societal Impact of Cross-Cultural Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research has shown that while large language models (LLMs) can generate their responses based on cultural context, they are not perfect and tend to generalize across cultures. However, when evaluating the cultural bias of a language technology on any dataset, researchers may choose not to engage with stakeholders actually using that technology in real life, which evades the very fundamental problem they set out to address.
  Inspired by the work done by arXiv:2005.14050v2, I set out to analyse recent literature about identifying and evaluating cultural bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I picked out 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias and came up with a set of observations to allow NLP researchers in the future to conceptualize bias concretely and evaluate its harms effectively. My aim is to advocate for a robust assessment of the societal impact of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Copyright Gap: Do Large Vision-Language Models Recognize and Respect Copyrighted Content?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.</description>

      <title>Toward Secure and Compliant AI: Organizational Standards and Protocols for NLP Model Lifecycle Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and government, where they handle large volumes of personal and regulated data. However, these systems introduce distinct risks related to security, privacy, and regulatory compliance that are not fully addressed by existing AI governance frameworks. This paper introduces the Secure and Compliant NLP Lifecycle Management Framework (SC-NLP-LMF), a comprehensive six-phase model designed to ensure the secure operation of NLP systems from development to retirement. The framework, developed through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 45 peer-reviewed and regulatory sources, aligns with leading standards, including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the EU AI Act, and MITRE ATLAS. It integrates established methods for bias detection, privacy protection (differential privacy, federated learning), secure deployment, explainability, and secure model decommissioning. A healthcare case study illustrates how SC-NLP-LMF detects emerging terminology drift (e.g., COVID-related language) and guides compliant model updates. The framework offers organizations a practical, lifecycle-wide structure for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure and accountable NLP systems in high-risk environments.</description>

      <title>Conversations with AI Chatbots Increase Short-Term Vaccine Intentions But Do Not Outperform Standard Public Health Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20519v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted through a 45-day follow-up relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Auditing Meta-Cognitive Hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning capabilities, but it has also made hallucination problems more frequent and harder to eliminate. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations through external knowledge integration, model parameter analysis, or self-verification, they often fail to capture how hallucinations emerge and evolve across the reasoning chain. In this work, we study the causality of hallucinations under constrained knowledge domains by auditing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectory and assessing the model's cognitive confidence in potentially erroneous or biased claims. Our analysis reveals that in long-CoT settings, RLLMs can iteratively reinforce biases and errors through flawed reflective reasoning, eventually leading to hallucinated reasoning paths. Surprisingly, even direct interventions at the origin of hallucinations often fail to reverse their effects, as reasoning chains exhibit 'chain disloyalty' -- a resistance to correction and a tendency to preserve flawed logic. Furthermore, we show that existing hallucination detection methods are less reliable and interpretable than previously assumed in complex reasoning scenarios. Unlike methods such as circuit tracing that require access to model internals, our black-box auditing approach supports interpretable long-chain hallucination attribution, offering better generalizability and practical utility.

      <title>The Decision Path to Control AI Risks Completely: Fundamental Control Mechanisms for AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) advances rapidly but achieving complete human control over AI risks remains an unsolved problem, akin to driving the fast AI "train" without a "brake system." By exploring fundamental control mechanisms at key elements of AI decisions, we develop a systematic solution to thoroughly control AI risks, providing an architecture for AI governance and legislation with five pillars supported by six control mechanisms, illustrated through a minimum set of AI Mandates (AIMs). Three of the AIMs must be built inside AI systems and three in society to address major areas of AI risks: 1) align AI values with human users; 2) constrain AI decision-actions by societal ethics, laws, and regulations; 3) build in human intervention options for emergencies and shut-off switches for existential threats; 4) limit AI access to user resources to reinforce controls inside AI; 5) mitigate spillover risks like job loss from AI. We also highlight the differences in AI governance on physical AI systems versus generative AI. We discuss how to strengthen analog physical safeguards to prevent AI or AGI from circumventing core safety controls by exploiting AI's intrinsic disconnect from the analog physical world: AI's nature as pure software code run on chips controlled by humans, and the prerequisite that all AI-driven physical actions must be digitized. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for AI governance and legislation as the basic structure of a "brake system" for AI decisions. If implemented, these controls can rein in AI dangers as completely as humanly possible, removing large chunks of currently wide-open AI risks, substantially reducing overall AI risks to residual human errors.</description>

      <title>AI Urban Scientist: Multi-Agent Collaborative Automation for Urban Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban research aims to understand how cities operate and evolve as complex adaptive systems. With the rapid growth of urban data and analytical methodologies, the central challenge of the field has shifted from data availability to the integration of heterogeneous data into coherent, verifiable urban knowledge through multidisciplinary approaches. Recent advances in AI, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have enabled the development of AI scientists capable of autonomous reasoning, hypothesis generation, and data-driven experimentation, demonstrating substantial potential for autonomous urban research. However, most general-purpose AI systems remain misaligned with the domain-specific knowledge, methodological conventions, and inferential standards required in urban studies. Here, we introduce the AI Urban Scientist, a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework designed to support autonomous urban research. Grounded in hypotheses, peer-review feedback, datasets, and research methodologies distilled from large-scale prior studies, the system constructs structured domain knowledge that guides LLM-based agents to automatically generate hypotheses, identify and integrate multi-source urban datasets, conduct empirical analyses and simulations, and iteratively refine analytical methods. Through this process, the framework synthesizes new insights in urban science and accelerates the urban research lifecycle.</description>

      <title>Preventing AI Deepfake Abuse: An Islamic Ethics Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake technology powered by AI has raised global concerns regarding the manipulation of information, the usurpation of digital identities, and the erosion of public trust in the authenticity of online content. These challenges extend beyond technical issues and involve complex moral dimensions, rendering conventional, technologically driven, and reactive management approaches insufficient to address underlying causes such as intent, ethical responsibility, and intangible social harm. In response to these challenges, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework as a preventive approach to mitigate the misuse of deepfake technology. This study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical gaps, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis demonstrates that integrating the principles of Maqasid al-Shariah, particularly hifz al-ird and hifz al-nafs, provides a strong normative foundation for governing the responsible use of digital technology. Based on the findings, this study proposes three strategic recommendations: regulatory reforms that recognize the intangible and psychological harms resulting from reputational damage; strengthened technology governance grounded in moral accountability and the values of adl, amanah, and transparency; and enhanced public digital literacy based on the principle of tabayyun. Overall, the findings suggest that the application of Islamic ethical principles shifts governance paradigms from punitive mechanisms toward preventive approaches that emphasize the protection of human dignity, the prevention of harm, and the promotion of the common good in the digital age.</description>

Abstract: Course evaluation plays a critical role in ensuring instructional quality and guiding curriculum development in higher education. However, traditional evaluation methods, such as student surveys, classroom observations, and expert reviews, are often constrained by subjectivity, high labor costs, and limited scalability. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged for generating consistent, fine-grained, and scalable course evaluations. This study investigates the use of three representative LLMs for automated course evaluation at both the micro level (classroom discussion analysis) and the macro level (holistic course review). Using classroom interaction transcripts and a dataset of 100 courses from a major institution in China, we demonstrate that LLMs can extract key pedagogical features and generate structured evaluation results aligned with expert judgement. A fine-tuned version of Llama shows superior reliability, producing score distributions with greater differentiation and stronger correlation with human evaluators than its counterparts. The results highlight three major findings: (1) LLMs can reliably perform systematic and interpretable course evaluations at both the micro and macro levels; (2) fine-tuning and prompt engineering significantly enhance evaluation accuracy and consistency; and (3) LLM-generated feedback provides actionable insights for teaching improvement. These findings illustrate the promise of LLM-based evaluation as a practical tool for supporting quality assurance and educational decision-making in large-scale higher education settings.</description>

      <title>The Probabilistic Foundations of Surveillance Failure: From False Alerts to Structural Bias</title>

Abstract: For decades, forensic statisticians have debated whether searching large DNA databases undermines the evidential value of a match. Modern surveillance faces an exponentially harder problem: screening populations across thousands of attributes using threshold rules rather than exact matching. Intuition suggests that requiring many coincidental matches should make false alerts astronomically unlikely. This intuition fails.
  Consider a system that monitors 1,000 attributes, each with a 0.5 percent innocent match rate. Matching 15 pre-specified attributes has probability \(10^{-35}\), one in 30 decillion, effectively impossible. But operational systems require no such specificity. They might flag anyone who matches \emph{any} 15 of the 1,000. In a city of one million innocent people, this produces about 226 false alerts. A seemingly impossible event becomes all but guaranteed. This is not an implementation flaw but a mathematical consequence of high-dimensional screening.
  We identify fundamental probabilistic limits on screening reliability. Systems undergo sharp transitions from reliable to unreliable with small increases in data scale, a fragility worsened by data growth and correlations. As data accumulate and correlation collapses effective dimensionality, systems enter regimes where alerts lose evidential value even when individual coincidences remain vanishingly rare. This framework reframes the DNA database controversy as a shift between operational regimes. Unequal surveillance exposures magnify failure, making ``structural bias'' mathematically inevitable. These limits are structural: beyond a critical scale, failure cannot be prevented through threshold adjustment or algorithmic refinement.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Graph Representation Learning with Limited Demographic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.</description>

      <title>Learning from sanctioned government suppliers: A machine learning and network science approach to detecting fraud and corruption in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting fraud and corruption in public procurement remains a major challenge for governments worldwide. Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too.</description>
