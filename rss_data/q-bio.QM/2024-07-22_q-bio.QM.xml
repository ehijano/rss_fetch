      <title>Statistical Models for Outbreak Detection of Measles in North Cotabato, Philippines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A measles outbreak occurs when the number of cases of measles in the population exceeds the typical level. Outbreaks that are not detected and managed early can increase mortality and morbidity and incur costs from activities responding to these events. The number of measles cases in the Province of North Cotabato, Philippines, was used in this study. Weekly reported cases of measles from January 2016 to December 2021 were provided by the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit of the North Cotabato Provincial Health Office. Several integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) time series models were used to explore the possibility of detecting and identifying measles outbreaks in the province along with the classical ARIMA model. These models were evaluated based on goodness of fit, measles outbreak detection accuracy, and timeliness. The results of this study confirmed that INAR models have the conceptual advantage over ARIMA since the latter produces non-integer forecasts, which are not realistic for count data such as measles cases. Among the INAR models, the ZINGINAR (1) model was recommended for having a good model fit and timely and accurate detection of outbreaks. Furthermore, policymakers and decision-makers from relevant government agencies can use the ZINGINAR (1) model to improve disease surveillance and implement preventive measures against contagious diseases beforehand.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Multi-Center Differential Protein Abundance Analysis with FedProt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative mass spectrometry has revolutionized proteomics by enabling simultaneous quantification of thousands of proteins. Pooling patient-derived data from multiple institutions enhances statistical power but raises significant privacy concerns. Here we introduce FedProt, the first privacy-preserving tool for collaborative differential protein abundance analysis of distributed data, which utilizes federated learning and additive secret sharing. In the absence of a multicenter patient-derived dataset for evaluation, we created two, one at five centers from LFQ E.coli experiments and one at three centers from TMT human serum. Evaluations using these datasets confirm that FedProt achieves accuracy equivalent to DEqMS applied to pooled data, with completely negligible absolute differences no greater than $\text{$4 \times 10^{-12}$}$. In contrast, -log10(p-values) computed by the most accurate meta-analysis methods diverged from the centralized analysis results by up to 25-27. FedProt is available as a web tool with detailed documentation as a FeatureCloud App.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Suite of Biological Cell Image Analysis Software for Computers, Smartphones, and Smart Glasses, Suitable for Resource-Constrained Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for personalizing medical treatment are the focal point of contemporary clinical research. In cancer care, for instance, we can analyze the effects of therapies at the level of individual cells. Complete characterization of treatment efficacy and evaluation of why some individuals respond to specific regimens, whereas others do not, requires additional approaches to genetic sequencing at single time points. Methods for the continuous analysis of changes in phenotype, such as morphology and motion tracking of cellular proteins and organelles over time frames spanning the minute-hour scales, can provide important insight to patient treatment options. The integration of measurements of intracellular dynamics and the contribution of multiple genetic pathways in degenerative diseases is vital for the development of biomarkers for the early detection of pathogenesis and therapy efficacy. We have developed a software suite (DataSet Tracker) for real-time analysis designed to run on computers, smartphones, and smart glasses hardware and suitable for resource-constrained, on-the-fly computing in microscopes without internet connectivity; a demo is available for viewing at datasetanalysis.com. Our objective is to present the community with an integrated, easy to use by all, tool for resolving the complex dynamics of the cytoskeletal meshworks, intracytoplasmic membranous networks, and vesicle trafficking. It is our goal to have this integrated tool approved for use in the clinical practice.</description>

      <title>U-learning for Prediction Inference via Combinatory Multi-Subsampling: With Applications to LASSO and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epigenetic aging clocks play a pivotal role in estimating an individual's biological age through the examination of DNA methylation patterns at numerous CpG (Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine) sites within their genome. However, making valid inferences on predicted epigenetic ages, or more broadly, on predictions derived from high-dimensional inputs, presents challenges. We introduce a novel U-learning approach via combinatory multi-subsampling for making ensemble predictions and constructing confidence intervals for predictions of continuous outcomes when traditional asymptotic methods are not applicable. More specifically, our approach conceptualizes the ensemble estimators within the framework of generalized U-statistics and invokes the H\'ajek projection for deriving the variances of predictions and constructing confidence intervals with valid conditional coverage probabilities. We apply our approach to two commonly used predictive algorithms, Lasso and deep neural networks (DNNs), and illustrate the validity of inferences with extensive numerical studies. We have applied these methods to predict the DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) of patients with various health conditions, aiming to accurately characterize the aging process and potentially guide anti-aging interventions.</description>

      <title>Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP) -- Simple and Strong Baseline for Molecular Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effectiveness of topological descriptors for molecular graph classification and design a simple, yet strong baseline. We demonstrate that a simple approach to feature engineering - employing histogram aggregation of edge descriptors and one-hot encoding for atomic numbers and bond types - when combined with a Random Forest classifier, can establish a strong baseline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The novel algorithm, Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP), integrates Edge Betweenness Centrality, Adjusted Rand Index and SCAN Structural Similarity score. This approach proves to be remarkably competitive when compared to modern GNNs, while also being simple, fast, low-variance and hyperparameter-free. Our approach is rigorously tested on MoleculeNet datasets using fair evaluation protocol provided by Open Graph Benchmark. We additionally show out-of-domain generation capabilities on peptide classification task from Long Range Graph Benchmark. The evaluations across eleven benchmark datasets reveal MOLTOP's strong discriminative capabilities, surpassing the $1$-WL test and even $3$-WL test for some classes of graphs. Our conclusion is that descriptor-based baselines, such as the one we propose, are still crucial for accurately assessing advancements in the GNN domain.</description>
