      <title>Fr\"ohlich versus Bose-Einstein Condensation in Pumped Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon-condensation, which emerges in pumped bosonic systems at room temperature, continues to garner great interest for its long-lived coherence. While traditionally formulated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensation, which typically occurs at ultra-low temperatures, it could potentially also be explained by Fr\"ohlich-condensation, a hypothesis of Bose-Einstein-like condensation in living systems at ambient temperatures. Here, we elucidate the essential features of magnon-condensation in an open quantum system (OQS) formulation, wherein magnons dissipatively interact with a phonon bath. Our derived equations of motion for expected magnon occupations turns out to be similar in form to the rate equations governing Fr\"ohlich-condensation. Provided that specific system parameters result in correlations amplifying or diminishing the condensation effects, we thereby posit that our treatment offers a better description of high-temperature condensation as opposed to traditional descriptions using equilibrium thermodynamics. By comparing our OQS derivation with the original uncorrelated and previous semi-classical rate equations, we furthermore highlight how both classical anti-correlations and quantum correlations alter the bosonic occupation distribution.</description>

      <title>Torus bifurcation of a dissipative time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a quantum gas setup consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity by a transverse pump laser, we experimentally observe an instability of a dissipative continuous time crystal (CTC) towards a time crystalline state exhibiting two prominent oscillation frequencies. Applying a mean-field approximation model and a Floquet analysis, we theoretically confirm that this transition is a manifestation in a many-body system of a torus bifurcation between a limit cycle (LC) and a limit torus (LT). We theoretically illustrate the LC and LT attractors using the minimal model and experimentally reconstruct them using Takens' embedding theorem applied to the non-destructively measured intracavity photon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the image projection of spatially incoherent light from a multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14192v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spatially incoherent light generated by a multimode fiber(MMF) in the application of image projection designed for the ultracold-atom experiments. Inspired by previous half-analytic methods concerning the incoherent light, here a full-numerical model is established to provide more quantitative descriptions, and part of results is compared with experiments. Particularly, our model about the MMF is also compatible with light propagation in free space. Based on this, we study both the intrinsic speckle and the perturbation robustness of a MMF light field, under the influence of light propagation and fiber parameters. We point out several guidelines about choosing the suitable MMF in creating a spatially incoherent light source, which is useful in the context of the ultracold-atom experiments associating with the optical potential projection.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological crystalline insulator under space-time inversion symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a large family of one-dimensional (1D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ invariants under space-time inversion symmetry. This finding stands in marked contrast to the conventional classification of 1D band topology protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantized polarization (Berry-Zak phase). By considering the nontrivial relative polarization among sublattices (orbitals), we introduce the inversion winding number as a topological invariant for characterizing and categorizing band topology. The inversion winding number reliably captures a novel bulk-edge correspondence, where gapped edge states are related to the inversion winding number of the sandwiching bands. Leveraging real-space analysis, we discover disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators and propose to experimentally discern band topology through relative polarization of edge states or bulk states. Our comprehensive findings present a paradigmatic illustration for the ongoing investigation and classification of band topology in TCIs.</description>

      <title>Scale-(in)dependence in quantum 4-body scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-channel 4-body scattering system using regularized 2- and 3-body contact interactions. The analysis determines the sensitivity of bound-state energies, scattering phase shifts and cross sections on the cutoff parameter ($\lambda$), and the energy gaps between scattering thresholds. The latter dependency is obtained with a 2-body scale fixed to an unnaturally large value and a floating 3-body parameter. Specifically, we calculate the binding energies of the shallow 3- and 4-body states, dimer-dimer and trimer-atom scattering lengths, and the trimer-atom to dimer-dimer reaction rates. Employing a potential renormalized by a large 2-body scattering length and a 3-body scale, we find all calculated observables to remain practically constant over the range $6\textrm{fm}^{-2}&lt;\lambda&lt;10\textrm{fm}^{-2}$. Divergences in scattering lengths emerge for critical 3-body parameters at which thresholds are degenerate. Such threshold effects are found to be independent of the regulator cutoff.
  Furthermore, at those critical points where the dimer-dimer and trimer-atom thresholds overlap, we predict an enhancement of the inelastic over the elastic scattering event. Such an inversion between elastic- and rearrangement-collision probabilities indicates a strong sensitivity of the 4-body reaction dynamics on the 3-body parameter at finite 2-body scale. This phenomenon is absent in earlier studies which differ in the renormalization scheme. As this discrepancy arises for all considered cutoffs, a more comprehensive parametrization of short-distance structure is necessary: sole cutoff variation does not reveal non-perturbative change in reaction rates conjectured to be due to a combined effect of the finite 2-body range and the specific choice for the 3-body parameter.</description>

      <title>Density engineering via inter-condensate dipole-dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of inter-condensate dipole-dipole interactions in a setup consisting of physically disconnected, single-species dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. In particular, making use of the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interactions, we show that the density of a {\em target} dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate can be axially confined and engineered using a trapped {\em control} dipolar condensate. Increasing the number of control condensates leads to exotic ground state structures, including periodic patterns in the target condensate. The latter leads to a structural transition between single and double-peaked structures with coherence between the peaks controlled via the separation between the control condensates.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory for strongly correlated effective Hamiltonians using effective field theory methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing low-energy effective Hamiltonians is usual to grasp most correlations in quantum many-body problems. For instance, such effective Hamiltonians can be treated at the mean-field level to reproduce some physical properties of interest. Employing effective Hamiltonians that contain many-body correlations renders the use of perturbative many-body techniques difficult because of the overcounting of correlations. In this work, we develop a strategy to apply an extension of the many-body perturbation theory starting from an effective interaction that contains correlations beyond the mean field level. The goal is to re-organize the many-body calculation to avoid the overcounting of correlations originating from the introduction of correlated effective Hamiltonians in the description. For this purpose, we generalize the formulation of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory by including free parameters adjusted to reproduce the appropriate limits. In particular, the expansion in the bare weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling limit serves as a valuable input to fix the value of the free parameters appearing in the resulting expression. This method avoids double counting of correlations using beyond-mean-field strategies for the description of many-body systems. The ground state energy of various systems relevant for ultracold atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics is reproduced qualitatively beyond the domain of validity of the standard many-body perturbation theory. Finally, our method suggests interpreting the formal results obtained as an effective field theory using the proposed reorganization of the many-body calculation. The results, like ground state energies, are improved systematically by considering higher orders in the extended many-body perturbation theory while maintaining a straightforward polynomial expansion.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of elementary excitations in disordered binary Bose mixtures: Effects of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the Anderson localization of quasiparticles in binary Bose mixtures in the presence of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections subjected to correlated disordered potentials. We calculate the density profiles, the Bogoliubov quasiparticles modes, and the localization length in both the mixture and droplet phases. We show that for one-dimensional speckle potentials, the peculiar interplay of disorder and the Lee-Huang-Yang fluctuations may enhance localization in one component while inducing delocalization in the other. Our results reveal also that thermal fluctuations lead to the emergence of two and multiple localization maxima. In the droplet state, our findings uncover that the Anderson localization of quasiparticles is weak in the flat-top region since its excitation modes are restricted to those below the particle-emission threshold.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometry of the Haldane Model under a Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Dopant pairing in a disordered magnetic spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying high-temperature disorder of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>
