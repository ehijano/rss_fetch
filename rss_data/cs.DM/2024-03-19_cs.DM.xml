      <title>Solving the Multiobjective Quasi-Clique Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simple undirected graph $G$, a quasi-clique is a subgraph of $G$ whose density is at least $\gamma$ $(0 &lt; \gamma \leq 1)$. Finding a maximum quasi-clique has been addressed from two different perspectives: $i)$ maximizing vertex cardinality for a given edge density; and $ii)$ maximizing edge density for a given vertex cardinality. However, when no a priori preference information about cardinality and density is available, a more natural approach is to consider the problem from a multiobjective perspective. We introduce the Multiobjective Quasi-clique Problem (MOQC), which aims to find a quasi-clique by simultaneously maximizing both vertex cardinality and edge density. To efficiently address this problem, we explore the relationship among MOQC, its single-objective counterpart problems, and a biobjective optimization problem, along with several properties of the MOQC problem and quasi-cliques. We propose a baseline approach using $\varepsilon$-constraint scalarization and introduce a Two-phase strategy, which applies a dichotomic search based on weighted sum scalarization in the first phase and an $\varepsilon$-constraint methodology in the second phase. Additionally, we present a Three-phase strategy that combines the dichotomic search used in Two-phase with a vertex-degree-based local search employing novel sufficient conditions to assess quasi-clique efficiency, followed by an $\varepsilon$-constraint in a final stage. Experimental results on real-world sparse graphs indicate that the integrated use of dichotomic search and local search, together with mechanisms to assess quasi-clique efficiency, makes the Three-phase strategy an effective approach for solving the MOQC problem in terms of running time and ability to produce new efficient quasi-cliques.</description>

      <title>Home Spaces and Invariants to Analyze Parameterized Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on comparing the notions of home spaces and invariants, in Transition Systems and more particularly, in Petri Nets as well as a variety of derived Petri Nets.
  After recalling basic notions of Petri Nets and semiflows, we then discuss important characteristics of finite generating sets for F, the set of all semiflows with integer coordinates of a given Petri Net. Then, we particularly focus on F+ the set of semiflows with non-negative coordinates.
  Minimality of semiflows and minimality of supports are critical to develop effective analysis of invariants and behavioral properties of Petri Nets such as boundedness or even liveness. We recall known decomposition theorems considering N, Q+, or Q.
  The result over N is being improved into a necessary and sufficient condition.
  In addition, we present general new results about the topology and the behavioral properties of a Petri Net, illustrating the importance of considering semiflows with non-negative coordinates.
  Then, we regroup a number of results around the notion of home space and home state applied to transition systems. Home spaces and semiflows are used to efficiently support the analysis of behavioral properties.
  In this regard, we present a methodology to analyze a Petri Nets by successive refinement of home spaces directly deduced from semiflows and apply it to analyze a parameterized example drawn from the telecommunication industry underlining the efficiency brought by using minimal semiflows of minimal supports as well as the new results on the topology of the model. This methodology is better articulated than in previous papers, and brings us closer to an automated analysis.</description>

      <title>Gap Amplification for Reconfiguration Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate gap amplification for reconfiguration problems. In particular, we prove an explicit factor of PSPACE-hardness of approximation for three popular reconfiguration problems only assuming the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH) due to Ohsaka (STACS 2023). Our main result is that under RIH, Maxmin 2-CSP Reconfiguration is PSPACE-hard to approximate within a factor of $0.9942$. Moreover, the same result holds even if the constraint graph is restricted to $(d,\lambda)$-expander for arbitrarily small $\frac{\lambda}{d}$. The crux of its proof is an alteration of the gap amplification technique due to Dinur (J. ACM, 2007), which amplifies the $1$ vs. $1-\varepsilon$ gap for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ up to the $1$ vs. $1-0.0058$ gap. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate that Minmax Set Cover Reconfiguration and Minmax Dominating Set Reconfiguratio} are PSPACE-hard to approximate within a factor of $1.0029$ under RIH. Our proof is based on a gap-preserving reduction from Label Cover to Set Cover due to Lund and Yannakakis (J. ACM, 1994). Unlike Lund--Yannakakis' reduction, the expander mixing lemma is essential to use. We highlight that all results hold unconditionally as long as "PSPACE-hard" is replaced by "NP-hard," and are the first explicit inapproximability results for reconfiguration problems without resorting to the parallel repetition theorem. We finally complement the main result by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate Maxmin 2-CSP Reconfiguration within a factor better than $\frac{3}{4}$.</description>
