      <title>Helping observers in closed universes reach their full potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Engelhardt, Gesteau, and Harlow applies proposals for incorporating observers into holographic maps to study the Antonini-Rath puzzle for closed universes. In a new form of ``observer complementarity,'' they find that an AdS bulk observer measures a SWAP test to determine that there is no closed universe in the bulk, contrary to the (limited) description given by an observer inside the closed universe. In this work, we improve the predictions of both observers by using the holographic maps to define new operators to perform this same SWAP test. With these, we show that the AdS observer cannot rule out a baby universe in the bulk, and the closed universe observer can improve the accuracy of their description.</description>

      <title>Effective potentials, warping, and implications for F-term uplifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse warping corrections to the scalar potential in flux compactifications of Type IIB string theory, focusing on their effect on $F$-term de Sitter uplifting in Calabi-Yau orientifold models. A systematic inverse-volume expansion allows us to derive the four-dimensional off-shell potential in the presence of warping and non-ISD 3-form fluxes. This corresponds to integrating out all massive Kaluza-Klein modes using the ten-dimensional equations of motion. We further propose a warped K\"ahler potential in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity, and show that it is consistent with our ten-dimensional results. In the KKLT framework, we find that classical warping corrections, as well as mixed corrections involving non-ISD fluxes and quantum effects, are dominant, rendering the scenario effectively uncontrollable with current methods. By contrast, in LVS-like constructions these corrections are suppressed by inverse powers of the volume, specifically $\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$ or $\mathcal{V}^{1/6}$, depending on the concrete model.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of UV divergences in ghost-free infinite derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the most general covariant gravity action up to terms that are quadratic in curvature. These can be endowed with generic form factors, which are functions of the d'Alembert operator. If they are chosen in a specific way as an exponent of an entire function, the theory becomes ghost-free and renormalizable at the price of non-locality. Furthermore, according to power-counting arguments, if these functions grow sufficiently fast along the real axis, divergences may only appear at the first order in loop expansion. Using the heat kernel technique, we compute the one-loop logarithmic divergences in the ultraviolet limit and determine the conditions under which they vanish completely, apart from the Gauss--Bonnet term and a surface term, both of which can be neglected on a four-dimensional manifold without a boundary. We identify form factors both within the Tomboulis class and beyond it that lead to vanishing logarithmic divergences. The general expression for the one-loop beta functions of the dimensionless couplings in quadratic gravity with asymptotically monomial form factors is given.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-Field Formalism for Higher-Derivative Boundary CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conformal field theory defined by the fourth-order operator on four-dimensional manifolds with boundaries, reformulating it through an auxiliary field so that the dynamics become second order. Within this framework, we compute the heat kernel of $\Box^2$ in flat space exactly, together with the associated Seeley-DeWitt coefficients for a broad class of non-standard boundary conditions. On curved backgrounds, we further construct the Weyl-invariant completion of the auxiliary field action with boundary terms and identify the corresponding conformal boundary conditions. Finally, we compute the boundary charges in the trace anomaly from the displacement operator correlators.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained, out-of-equilibrium inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use holography to study dS-invariant states of non-conformal, strongly coupled quantum field theories in four-dimensional de Sitter space. We show that out-of-equilibrium effects can sustain the exponential inflation within the regime of validity of semiclassical gravity, $H \ll M \ll M_\mathrm{sp}$, with $H$ the Hubble parameter, $M$ the characteristic scale of the quantum field theory, $M_\mathrm{sp} = M_\mathrm{p}/N$ the species scale, $M_\mathrm{p}$ the Planck scale, and $N^2$ the number of matter fields. In the holographic description, the required fine-tuning scales only logarithmically with the ratio $M_\mathrm{sp}/H$. The resulting solutions exhibit apparent horizons whose increasing area indicates a continuous growth of the comoving entropy density. We suggest that this inflationary regime can arise as the late-time limit of a dynamical evolution starting from an initial Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe.</description>

      <title>Mapping moduli across heterotic conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide evidence for a duality between 4-dimensional Calabi-Yau compactifications of the heterotic string, in which the base manifolds are linked by a conifold transition. In recent work, a geometric proposal was put forward for how 5-branes and gauge bundles are carried across such transitions. It was observed that compactifications connected in this way lead to 4-dimensional effective theories with the same massless spectrum. Here we provide much stronger evidence that these heterotic conifold transitions do indeed lead to dual theories. We construct a duality map between the field spaces of the two compactifications and use it to demonstrate the agreement of large numbers of holomorphic functions appearing in the definition of the effective theories. In an example, we show that 147,440 independent superpotential Yukawa couplings agree across the duality as holomorphic functions of the moduli. In certain special cases, the putative duality studied here reduces to the target space duality of (0,2) gauged linear sigma models.</description>

      <title>Supergravity anomaly equations from modularity of Calabi--Yau threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F-theory compactifications on elliptically fibered Calabi--Yau threefolds yield consistent six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravity theories, for which the cancellation of gravitational, gauge and mixed anomalies imposes non-trivial algebraic relations between classical intersection data and enumerative geometry invariants of curves in the fiber. In this work, we capture the spectrum of such theories via meromorphic quasi-Jacobi forms of index zero whose Fourier coefficients determine the genus zero Gromov--Witten theory restricted to curve classes in the fiber. We find that the one-loop anomaly coefficients of the effective six-dimensional theories are encoded in the modular properties of these automorphic forms, while the Green--Schwarz counterterms are made manifest by the Fourier--Mukai transform action on zero- and two-branes associated with double T-duality along the elliptic fiber. Moreover, we show that the anomaly cancellation conditions are automatically satisfied in this class of string compactifications as a consequence of the holomorphic anomaly equations of topological string theory.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi equations for Dirac-Born-Infeld cosmic string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the question of whether Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) cosmic strings can admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) configurations. Earlier work by Babichev et al. arXiv:0809.2013 concluded that DBI strings with the standard Mexican-hat potential possess no BPS limit, implying an unavoidable nonzero binding energy. In contrast, using the BPS Lagrangian method, we show that DBI strings do admit BPS solutions, provided the potential is chosen self-consistently. Imposing the existence of Bogomol'nyi equations uniquely determines the admissible potential and yields exact first-order BPS equations for DBI vortices. We independently verify the consistency of these equations using the stressless (vanishing-pressure) condition on the energy-momentum tensor. The resulting solutions saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, exhibit zero binding energy, and smoothly recover the Nielsen-Olesen string in the limit $\alpha \to 0$. Regularity of the gauge-field equation requires $\alpha &lt; \pi^2$. A notable outcome of the construction is that the BPS-compatible potential takes a trigonometric form closely related to the sine-Gordon potential, revealing a natural correspondence between the sine-Gordon string and the BPS DBI string. The BPS tension scales linearly with the winding number $n$ but acquires an $\alpha$-dependent deformation.</description>

      <title>Multiresolution analysis of quantum theories using Daubechies wavelet basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow equation methods, more generally known as Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) techniques, were developed to address multiscale problems where multiple length or energy scales contribute simultaneously. In this Thesis, we formulate the flow equation method within a wavelet-based framework and apply it to study scale (resolution) separation in a two-dimensional scalar field theory. We demonstrate that the flow systematically block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian with respect to wavelet resolution, achieving improved truncation compared to earlier studies. Using a model of two real scalar fields coupled through a quadratic interaction, we show that the flow equations effectively suppress couplings between low- and high-resolution degrees of freedom. This provides a clear mechanism for isolating low-resolution physics and offers insight into the construction of effective Hamiltonians using a wavelet-based flow equation approac</description>

      <title>F-theorem for Quantum Field Theories in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a regularized free energy $\mathcal{F}_{\text{AdS}}$ for massive quantum field theories (QFTs) on Anti-de Sitter space (AdS). We conjecture this quantity to be monotonic under the renormalization group (RG) flow induced by boundary perturbations, generalizing the known boundary $F$-theorem to non-conformal setups. We test this conjecture in several examples and provide a proof in two dimensions. We also discuss applications to long-range critical points, obtaining bounds on the sphere free energy of long- and short-range Ising models in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Approximating Feynman Integrals Using Complete Monotonicity and Stieltjes Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two novel numerical approaches for computing Feynman integrals based on their complete monotonicity (CM) and Stieltjes properties. The first method uses that scalar Feynman integrals are CM, meaning that all their derivatives have a fixed sign, in the Euclidean kinematic region. This imposes strong constraints on the function space. Simultaneously, these integrals obey systems of linear differential equations with respect to kinematic parameters. By imposing that the solutions to these differential equations satisfy complete monotonicity across the Euclidean region, we develop an efficient and highly constraining numerical bootstrap method. We provide a proof of principle of the power of our approach by applying it to a class of multi-loop Feynman integrals with internal masses. The second method is based on a refinement of CM. We prove that Feynman integrals, within a certain range of parameters, such as dimension and propagator exponents, are not only CM but in fact Stieltjes functions. The latter can be described efficiently by Pad\'e approximants that are known to converge in the cut complex plane. This means that these representations are valid also in analytically continued kinematics, such as physical scattering regions. These insights allow us to obtain rational approximations to Feynman integrals from minimal information, such as a Taylor expansion about a soft limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to a 20-loop banana-type Feynman integral. Finally, we comment on a number of extensions of these novel avenues for computing Feynman integrals.</description>

Abstract: We study the origin of modular weights of wave functions in magnetized $T^{2}$ models. It is explicitly demonstrated that the modular weights of the wave functions on magnetized $T^2$ is equivalent to their mass level. We further extend this result to magnetized $T^{2g}$ models. As a result, we construct the wave functions of excited states in magnetized $T^{2g}$ models and show that their modular weights are likewise equivalent to the corresponding mass levels.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a manifestly covariant and coordinate-free plane-wave representation of scalar two-point functions in $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. The construction is based on a new class of holomorphic plane waves defined globally on the universal covering of the AdS via chiral cones in the complex null cone. Imposing AdS invariance, locality, positive definiteness and a spectral condition, we obtain integral representations as superpositions over relative homology cycles,
  reproducing the standard maximally analytic solutions in terms of Legendre functions of the second kind. In Poincar\'e coordinates, the two-point functions diagonalize into a Kallen-Lehmann superposition of (d-1)-dimensional Minkowski correlators where the weight is a product of Bessel functions. This diagonalization clarifies the relation between Euclidean and Lorentzian AdS quantum field theory and allows Wick rotation of Euclidean Feynman diagrams to Lorentzian integrals supported on a single Poincare patch while preserving full AdS covariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for the construction of a holographic simple tree graph model that realizes a given entropy vector, subject to a specific ``chordality'' condition first introduced in arXiv:2412.18018. We further develop the toolkit of the correlation hypergraph, particularly in relation to coarse-graining and fine-graining of subsystems. We then use these techniques to take the first steps towards the generalization of this new algorithm to arbitrary (not necessarily simple) holographic tree graph models, and the ``detection'' of unrealizability of an entropy vector independently from the knowledge of holographic entropy inequalities.</description>

Abstract: Renormalization group flow equations of the fluid dynamical shear viscosity transport coefficient of a relativistic real scalar field are derived. The flowing effective action contains branch cut contributions to the self energy and interaction vertex in the symmetric phase. We demonstrate how the flow equation method can systematically extend the perturbative resummation schemes. We show that our truncation is in that sense a minimal scheme in which a reliable viscosity coefficient is obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new families of non-toric 5d SCFTs via abelian orbifolds of the Reid Pagoda, including a surprising infinite family of rank-1 theories, that evade all known classifications. Using the McKay correspondence, we derive their BPS quivers and superpotentials. The hallmark of these theories is a novel sector we dub Pagoda matter, whose vacuum expectation values obstruct the Kaehler moduli. This mechanism freezes the gauge coupling to infinite value, precluding a weak-coupling limit and rendering the theories intrinsically strongly coupled. Finally, we interpret these results as 5d SCFTs deformed by non-constant flavor backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Dynamics by (Non-)Unitary Local Operator Quenches in a 2D Holographic CFT</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of entanglement entropy and mutual information for the spatially-infinite systems where we act with a primary operator on the vacuum state and then time-evolve it with the sequence of the Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions. Two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories describe the systems under consideration in this paper. The Euclidean time evolution is induced by the Rindler Hamiltonian and behaves as the regulator that tames the divergence induced by the local operator, while the Lorentzian one is induced by the uniform Hamiltonian. Under these time evolutions, we investigate the time ordering effect of the Rindler Euclidean and uniform Lorentzian time evolution operators. Consequently, we find the remarkable differences between those time evolutions are induced by whether those are unitary or non-unitary. Especially, we find that the unitary time evolution induces the late-time logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy, while the non-unitary time evolution induces the late-time constant behavior. Furthermore, we investigate the dual gravity of the systems under consideration. Especially, we investigate the gravity duals of the systems with the insertion of the heavy primary operator and show that it is a black brane with a spacetime-dependent horizon.</description>

      <title>Quantum Black Holes and Gauge/Gravity Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a conceptual point of view, this chapter may be viewed as an exercise in combining quantum field theory and general relativity in a controlled setting. Despite its apparent simplicity, this exercise is deeply rooted in highly non-trivial developments in superstring theory and holography, and it addresses what is arguably one of the most profound questions in quantum gravity: the fate of information in black hole evaporation. For this reason, one is naturally compelled to examine this exercise as carefully as possible, closely following the original authors.
  This chapter presents thus a detailed overview of recent work by Almheiri et al. and Penington on the AdS2 black hole information loss paradox and its proposed resolution within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The roles of generalized entanglement entropy, quantum extremal surfaces, the island conjecture, holography, and replica wormholes in this resolution are discussed in detail. The distinction between the von Neumann entropy and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in black hole physics is carefully clarified. It is shown that a phase transition at the Page time, between the trivial quantum extremal surface at the horizon and a non-vanishing quantum extremal surface located behind the horizon, leads to the correct Page curve.
  A simplified version of the information loss problem for the eternal AdS2 black hole, together with its resolution along similar lines, is also presented. The replica trick and its crucial role in computing entanglement entropies for various intervals in AdS2 are discussed at some length. However, the use of the replica trick in constructing replica wormholes that dominate the Euclidean path integral, thereby leading to the island rule and the correct quantum extremal surfaces, is only outlined.</description>

Abstract: Noncommutative field theory (NCFT) is an extension of quantum field theory (QFT) that redefines spacetime, replacing commuting coordinates with a noncommutative structure. This shift fundamentally alters the way fields, interactions, and symmetries are understood. NCFT uniquely integrates with supersymmetry, making it a natural framework for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity. It also provides a consistent mechanism for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Unlike conventional QFT, which quantizes fields on a fixed spacetime, NCFT begins by quantizing spacetime itself. This perspective reveals novel phenomena, such as ultraviolet-infrared mixing and a natural transition from discrete to continuous geometries. It offers insights into quantum gravity at the Planck scale. Mathematically, NCFT bridges quantum mechanics and geometry through operator algebras, enabling the exploration of new theories unattainable in traditional frameworks. This dual role cements NCFT as a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics.

      <title>The evaporation of near-extremal black holes through charged particle emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the quantum rate for massless charged scalar emission by a near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole using Schwarzian theory as the effective description of the black hole. This is compared to the semi-classical Hawking rate which we also compute near extremality. We classify black holes into small and large, each with a unique spectrum. For small black holes, at energies below a particular quantum scale, the emission is captured by the quantum rate, which gives different predictions from the semi-classical. Furthermore, depending on how the energy compares to another scale associated with the phenomenon of superradiance, the radiation either comes out as mostly non-superradiant or mostly superradiant. For non-superradiant emission, it is found that the quantum rate is suppressed compared to the semi-classical in the same way as recently observed for neutral radiation. For superradiant emission, a novel behavior is observed, the quantum rate is enhanced compared to the semi-classical. For large black holes, we argue that the quantum rate always reduces to the semi-classical. In the limit of very large black holes, from our semi-classical rate, we recover the Gibbons result of Schwinger-like suppression. This gives a unified story of near-extremal charged emission rates, both quantum and semi-classical, which covers all sizes of black hole and all energy regimes. We use these rates to discuss the evaporation history of each type of black hole, from when it starts very near extremality, until it has left this regime. Finally, for the near-extremal Kerr black hole, we argue that the quantum rate always reduces to the semi-classical with the superradiant modes dominating. This rate is computed for spin $0,1,2$. Our analysis emphasizes the AdS$_2$ structure of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr near-horizon regions, which enables a completely parallel treatment of the two.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Information Localizability and Holography in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence states an equivalence between a quantum gravitational theory in a (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS$_{d+1}$) and a d-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT$_{d}$). The CFT$_{d}$ lives on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk AdS$_{d+1}$. Hence a local operator in the bulk of the AdS$_{d+1}$ should be reconstructable using operators living on the asymptotic boundary at the same instant. The existence of such a reconstruction is highly nontrivial and is conceptually puzzling if we think in terms of physically detecting a local bulk particle from the boundary of the AdS$_{d+1}$, as this signals a non-local information encoding scheme. In this paper, we explore situations where such non-locally encoded information can be observed in semiclassical gravity. We study examples where it is more efficient to utilize such effects in quantum gravity to detect a bulk excitation than to wait for signals to reach the boundary. Furthermore, we provide exemplified situations for which the protocol fails, and the non-locality of information is suppressed. These exemplified scenarios can be taken as explicit examples of the emergence of a perturbatively localized observer. In such cases, holography cannot be proven at the perturbative level in Newton's constant $G_{N}$ via the non-localizability of information.</description>

      <title>Sine-Liouville gravity as a Vertex Model on Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universal behaviour of a one-parameter generalisation of the six-vertex model on planar graphs, which we refer to as the 7-vertex model (7vM). The 7vM is characterised by a temperature coupling and its continuum limit is characterised by a massive, dilute and dense phases similarly to the $O(n)$ loop model. We compute the sphere and disk partition functions of the 7vM from the spectral curve of the dual matrix model, abbreviated here as 7vMM. The disk partition function for fixed length is expressed in terms of an uncharted deformation of the K-Bessel functions. We argue that 7vMM and Matrix Quantum Mechanics (MQM) provide two complementary non-perturbative realisations of sine-Liouville gravity. Specifically, we find that the continuum limit of 7vMM and the MQM share the same classical spectral curve but describe two different types of branes in sine-Liouville gravity. The 7vMM precisely covers the range of parameters where the Minkowskian MQM lacks a simple interpretation in terms of multiple tachyon scattering. We investigate the flow relating the dilute and the dense phases and argue that this flow is the gravitational analogue of the massless flow in the sine-Gordon model with imaginary mass coupling. The two extremities of the flow are described by a free boson coupled to Liouville gravity and compactified at circles with two different radii.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the correlation functions between the dynamical variables and between their conjugate momenta at sites of a harmonic lattice in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that at the thermodynamic limit, they can be expressed in terms of Lauricella's C-type hypergeometric series. Furthermore, using these expressions, we explicitly demonstrate that the correlators near the center of the lattice satisfying Diriclet boundary conditions coincide with those for the lattice with the periodic boundary conditions. By utilizing these expressions, we expect to make it easier to create programs that compute fast and highly precise for the quantum information quantities of subsystems within lattices.</description>

      <title>Light-ray Operators and the ${\rm w}_{1+\infty}$ Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal class of light-ray operators formed from null integrals of the stress tensor is constructed in generic interacting Lorentzian conformal field theories in four spacetime dimensions. This class of light-ray operators generates the wedge algebra of ${\rm w}_{1+\infty}$, which was recently identified among the asymptotic symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes. In four-dimensional conformal field theories with an additional spin-one conserved current, a second universal class of light-ray operators is constructed and shown to generate the ''$S$ algebra,'' the gauge-theoretic analog of ${\rm w}_{1+\infty}$. Finally, a precise relation is established between the one-point functions of these light-ray operators in scalar states and the universal soft factors in the infinite tower of soft graviton theorems. The results presented in this paper will be accompanied by detailed calculations and proofs in a longer forthcoming work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are duality transformations symmetries of string theory? For AdS space-time the answer is no for generic asymptotic values of the moduli, since the duality symmetry is broken explicitly in the dual conformal field theory. In contrast, in string theory in flat space-time, monodromy around codimension two exotic branes show that duality transformations are spontaneously broken discrete gauge symmetries with observable consequences, provided macroscopic loops of these branes are not hidden behind an event horizon. We discuss how this can be achieved and how the situation in flat space-time differs from that in AdS space-time. We also discuss observability of codimension two non-BPS branes and codimension one BPS and non-BPS branes.</description>

      <title>Dunkl-Corrected Deformation of RN-AdS Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new class of charged black holes by introducing Dunkl derivatives in the four dimensional spacetime. To construct such solutions, we first compute the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar using the Christoffel symbols. Substituting them into the modified Einstein field equations via extended Dunkl derivations, we obtain the metric function of charged Dunkl black holes. Next, we investigate the charge effect on the corresponding thermodynamical properties by computing the associated quantities. To study the thermal stability, we calculate the heat capacity. After that, we approach the P-v criticality behaviors by determining the critical pressure Pc, the critical temperature Tc and the critical specific volume vc in terms of Q and two parameters A and B carrying data on the Dunkl reflections. Precisely, we show that the ratio Pcvc Tc is a universal number with respect to the charge Q and B parameters. Taking a zero limit of A, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors. For Joule-Thomson expansion effects for such charged black holes, we reveal certain similarities and the differences with Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we discuss the phase transitions via the Gibbs free energy computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An in-in framework under Schwinger pair creating fields in strong-field quantum electrodynamics is formulated using in-out propagators in coordinate space, that have first-quantized or worldline representation. The framework is derived to all orders in the background field coupling from both the Bogoliubov coefficient method and Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path formalism. In-out matrix elements in pair creating fields are readily handled using first-quantized methods, and the approach we develop serves to facilitate the evaluation of in-in observables in pair creating backgrounds. We find that in-in augmentations to the in-out partition function and or propagator amount to the insertion of a non-local interaction term that sandwiches a function that serves to enclose singularities in complex Schwinger propertime. Furthermore, we show the resummation of the in-in partition function leading to vacuum non-persistence that en-route gives an exact first-quantized definition of creating $N$-pairs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a new route toward a non-perturbative quantization of gravity based on a purely affine formulation, where the affine connection is the fundamental field and the metric, when it exists, emerges as a derived quantity. Starting from the Palatini formulation of General Relativity, we recall how an equivalent Eddington-type purely affine action arises at the classical level under mild assumptions. A key feature for the non-perturbative program is that, in the pure gravity case, for a positive cosmological constant, the action is bounded below, allowing one to define a well-posed statistical ensemble of connections. We discretize this theory on a fixed hypercubic lattice and construct the corresponding partition function, including torsionful and torsionless ensembles. We provide an open C++ Monte Carlo implementation that can simulate these ensembles in arbitrary dimension, and we present proof-of-principle results in two dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll \omega,k\ll \mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\omega,k,T\ll\mu$ at leading order in $T/\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quantisation of the tachyonic type 0B superstring and the non-tachyonic $\text{Spin}(16) \times \text{Spin}(16) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ heterotic string on AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ and AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ backgrounds. Adapting the analysis for the supersymmetric and bosonic string theories to these set-ups, we provide a world-sheet description for a generic level of the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model, and we read the spectrum through the associated partition functions. Focusing on the low-energy theory, we show that the $\text{Spin}(16) \times \text{Spin}(16) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ heterotic string on both backgrounds accommodates non-trivial Wilson lines that are responsible for the appearance of tachyonic regions in the classical moduli space, hence jeopardising the stability of the vacuum. We show this with a concrete example on the AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ space and provide general formulas for a systematic analysis of the classical moduli space.</description>

      <title>From $\mathrm{d} \! \log$ to $\mathrm{d} \mathcal{E}$: Canonical Elliptic Integrands and Modular Symbol Letters with Pure eMPLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose '$\mathrm{d} \mathcal{E}$-forms' as fundamental building blocks of canonical integrands for elliptic Feynman integrals, which lead to Kronecker-Eisenstein $\omega$-form symbol letters. Built upon pure elliptic multiple polylogarithms, they provide a natural extension of the '$\mathrm{d} \! \log$-form' integrands and $\mathrm{d} \! \log$ letters for polylogarithmic cases. By introducing an extended basis treating all marked points equally, we manifest a hidden symmetry structure in the canonical connection matrix, and demonstrate its covariance under modular transformations. Our result provides a novel perspective on describing canonical bases and symbol letters in a unified language of pure functions.</description>

      <title>Holographic correlators from multi-mode AdS$_5$ bubbling geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supergravity calculations of holographic four-point correlation functions are a powerful tool for deriving dynamical information about the dual field theory at strong coupling. Recently, a number of such computations have been performed by studying light probes of smooth horizonless supergravity solutions, including certain asymptotically $AdS_5\times S^5$ solutions of Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM) type. We construct a new closed-form perturbative LLM solution involving a pair of linearized supergravitons with different mode numbers and their quadratic backreaction. Using this solution, we compute two infinite sequences of four-point correlators. Depending on the scaling of certain parameters, the background supergravity solutions are dual to states of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that are either heavy or light, whereupon the correlators in the dual field theory are either (perturbatively) heavy-heavy-light-light or all-light. In the all-light regime, the correlators we compute are related by superconformal Ward identities to correlators of four single-particle chiral primary operators (CPOs). We confirm a set of expressions in the literature for such correlators of CPOs, that were obtained via Mellin space bootstrap and/or Witten diagram methods. We also obtain a novel compact expression for one of the two infinite sequences of correlators of chiral primaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BRST Noether theorem, or ``Noether's 1.5 theorem'', asserts the triviality of the BRST Noether current. We provide two proofs of this theorem that are both valid without restriction on the structure of the gauge theory, extending thereby previous proofs holding in the case of gauge theories for which the solution of the master equation is linear in the antifields. We also relate explicitly the BRST Noether current to the BRST master current appearing in the master equation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Tensor Networks as Tessellations of Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks serve as toy models for the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, capturing many of its essential features in a concrete manner. However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical theories in a periodic potential: strange metallic thermoelectric and magneto-transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study DC and AC thermoelectric and magneto-transport in 2D quantum critical theories with strong translational symmetry breaking due to a % varying chemical potential lattice with zero average $\bar{\mu}=0$. The combination of quantum criticality and the absence of the average natural scale implies that such systems have idiosyncratic signatures that may apply more generally when the variance in the lattice potential far exceeds the average or for strong translational symmetry breaking in general. We model such theories holographically through near-extremal AdS black holes. We find that these systems (a) become \emph{better} conductors. In a 2D lattice, this can be explained by currents flowing around obstacles; (b) exhibit bad-metal electrical transport with Drude-like thermal transport, though it is not Drude, and, notably, (c) display an approximately $B$-linear longitudinal magnetoresistance at large fields, similar to Effective Medium Theory. We comment on how these results may apply when $\bar{\mu}\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>$\text{Spin}^h$ Structure, Scalar and Charged Spinor Eigenfunctions on the $SU(3)/SO(3)$ Wu Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised spin structures are necessary for placing fermions on manifolds that do not admit a standard spin structure. This is especially relevant in a dimensional reduction on such a manifold, which can then be compensated by using fermions that are appropriately charged under some Maxwell or Yang-Mills field defined on the internal manifold. A well known example in the physics literature is $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which has four real dimensions and is the coset $SU(3)/U(2)$. In this paper we focus on a five-dimensional coset space, namely the Wu manifold $SU(3)/SO(3)_{\rm max}$, where $SO(3)_{\rm max}$ is maximal in $SU(3)$. Intriguingly, the Wu manifold does not admit a spin structure or spin$^c$ structure, it does admit a spin$^h$ structure. We provide a physical interpretation of the spin$^h$ structure by considering spinors that are coupled to an $SO(3)$ Yang-Mills field defined on the Wu manifold, but which carry half-integer "isospin," thereby canceling the minus sign in the holonomy for uncharged spinors that provides the original obstruction to an ordinary spin structure. We also construct a gauge-covariantly constant spinor in the Wu manifold, and we show how this can be employed in order to construct spin$^h$ spinor harmonics from scalar harmonics. We provide a very explicit construction of all the scalar and spin$^h$ harmonics. In a follow-up paper, we shall employ the results we obtain here in order to discuss dimensional reductions and consistent reductions on the Wu manifold.</description>

      <title>Six-loop gravitational interactions at the sixth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational interaction of two coalescing compact objects at sixth post-Newtonian order in the static limit, employing the diagrammatic approach within the effective field theory framework of General Relativity. The calculation requires the evaluation of six-loop Feynman diagrams that are mapped onto two-point integrals with a gauge-theory-like structure, which are computed here for the first time. The resulting seventh-order contribution in Newton's constant is finite in three space dimensions. This result provides the most technically demanding missing ingredient for the determination of the conservative dynamics of the gravitational two-body system at sixth post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure Functions for small DIS (deep inelastic scattering) $x$ for integrable models are investigated, in particular, for the $O(N)$~$\sigma $-model and $SU(N)$ chiral Gross-Neveu model, which are asymptotically free. We get the universal behavior $x^{-1}\ln^{-2}x$ at small Bjorken variable $x$ and confirm a Balog Weisz conjecture. For a the second group of models, the Sine-Gordon, sinh-Gordon and $Z(N)$, we find power behavior $x^{-\lambda}$. The special behavior of the structure function for the Sine-Gordon model is probably crucial for future investigation in 4D QCD.</description>

      <title>Universal BPS Structure of Scalar Kinks in Static Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric extension of the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) construction for scalar kinks in (1+1) dimensions embedded in static curved spacetimes. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between the scalar prepotential and the extrinsic curvature of the static foliation, the flat-space first-order Bogomolny equation remains exactly valid for arbitrary static backgrounds. As a consequence, the kink profile is unchanged, while the effective potential and vacuum structure acquire a controlled geometric dependence. We show that these curved-space BPS kinks are always linearly stable. However, the existence of the translational zero mode is not guaranteed: its normalizability depends on the competition between the intrinsic length scale of the kink and the asymptotic curvature scale of the geometry. When the geometric scale dominates, the zero mode is removed and the soliton becomes geometrically pinned, despite remaining an exact BPS solution. Explicit realizations in AdS2 demonstrate how different static slicings of the same spacetime lead to qualitatively distinct physical outcomes, ranging from preserved translational invariance to its complete removal by horizons. These results establish geometry as a precise mechanism for controlling solitonic moduli without compromising linear stability.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible defects from the Conway SCFT to K3 sigma models II: duality and Fibonacci defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study, initiated in [hep-th:2504.18619], of topological defect lines (TDLs) in the Conway module $V^{f \natural}$ and K3 non-linear sigma models (NLSMs). In the case of $V^{f \natural}$, we fully classify the potential $N=1$ (and $N=4$)--preserving duality defects for cyclic Tambara--Yamagami categories TY$(\mathbb{Z}_N)$, noting a curious relation to genus zero groups of monstrous moonshine. We use the correspondence with Leech lattice endomorphisms, discovered in [hep-th:2504.18619], to construct a number of non-trivial examples of TDLs in $V^{f \natural}$, including examples of irrational quantum dimension. In particular, we fully classify and construct defects for the TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and TY$(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ cases, and provide examples of duality defects for TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ and Fibonacci fusion categories as well. In the case of K3 NLSMs, we describe a duality defect of irrational quantum dimension $\sqrt{2}$ for the category TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2, -1)$ in a particular torus orbifold, which exists on a 16-dimensional slice of the moduli space. We also provide a detailed analysis of spectral flow--preserving TDLs in Gepner models of K3, of independent interest, and use this to construct non-invertible defects for Fibonacci and $Rep(S_3)$ categories in particular examples. Finally we provide evidence for our conjecture in [hep-th:2504.18619] that special subcategories of such TDLs in $V^{f \natural}$ correspond to $N=(4,4)$ and spectral flow--preserving defect lines in a corresponding K3 NLSM. In particular, we compute defect--twined elliptic genera for all non-invertible defects constructed in this article, demonstrating that for each defect found in a K3 NLSM, there is a corresponding defect in $V^{f \natural}$ with coincident twining genus, and making a prediction for a number of TDLs in K3 NLSMs yet to be found.</description>

      <title>Schwarzian quantum corrections to shear correlators of the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-AdS$_2$ spacetimes are controlled by a Schwarzian effective dual theory. The Kaluza-Klein reduction of higher-dimensional black holes shows that the Schwarzian generates a logarithmic contribution to the entropy, thereby resolving a long-standing puzzle in near-extremal black hole thermodynamics. Here, we leverage exact results for quantum-corrected, Schwarzian scalar correlation functions in order to evaluate the impact of bulk quantum fluctuations on the low-temperature shear correlators of the state dual to Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS$_4$ black holes with a flat, compact horizon. In the hydrodynamic regime, we find that quantum fluctuations tend to increase the shear viscosity away from $s/(4\pi)$, thereby preserving the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound. Outside the hydrodynamic regime, quantum fluctuations lift the zero temperature, classical gapless modes reported in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Finite-gap potentials as a semiclassical limit of the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the semiclassical limit of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations naturally reconstructs the algebro-geometric spectra of finite-gap periodic potentials. This correspondence is illustrated using the traveling-wave (snoidal) solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation. In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Renormalization of Anisotropic Two-Scalar Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Euclidean quantum field theory of two interacting real scalar fields in $D=4-\epsilon$ dimensions with the most general two--derivative but Lorentz--violating quadratic structure, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and field--mixing time and cross--gradient terms, together with general cubic and quartic interactions. Although Lorentz violation is introduced only through the kinetic sector, the renormalization structure is nontrivial: interactions generate additional couplings, including masses and linear terms, so a consistent renormalization--group analysis cannot be formulated in terms of modified kinetic terms alone and requires an RG--complete operator basis compatible with the reduced symmetry.
  We perform a systematic one--loop renormalization and derive the complete set of beta functions for cubic and quartic couplings, masses, and linear terms. We identify and analyze the resulting fixed points and fixed manifolds, showing in particular how anisotropy restricts their existence and stability. In particular we obtain how anisotropy restricts existence of canonical Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Also we provide a transparent physical interpretation of the anisotropy--dependent coefficients appearing in the beta functions and clarify how kinetic mixing reshapes the interaction flow through the available ultraviolet phase space.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Holomorphic Masses in AdS/CFT with Flavour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In type IIB supergravity (SUGRA), in the extremal background of a number N_c of D3-branes we consider a number N_f of probe D7-branes extended along all four D3-brane directions, (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3). Using (x_2,x_3) to define complex coordinates (z,\bar{z}) and defining the D7-branes' worldvolume scalars as (y,\bar{y}), we prove that any holomorphic function y(z) or antiholomorphic function y(\bar{z}) is a BPS solution of the D7-branes' equations of motion preserving N=(4,0) or (0,4) supersymmetry (SUSY) along (x_0,x_1), respectively. In the near-horizon geometry, five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime times a five-sphere, the AdS/Conformal Field Theory correspondence states that type IIB SUGRA is holographically dual to four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory at large N_c and large 't Hooft coupling, and the N_f D7-branes are dual to N_f N=2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation, i.e. flavour fields. Our D7-brane solutions are dual to a position-dependent hypermultiplet mass m that is holomorphic, m(z), or antiholomorphic, m(\bar{z}). We provide field theory proofs, valid for any N_c, N_f, and 't Hooft coupling, that such m preserve N=(4,0) or (0,4) SUSY along (x_0,x_1). We also perform holographic calculations with probe D7-branes to show that the theory with such m has zero energy and zero expectation value of the mass operator, and that a zero of m is dual to a superconformal defect described by chiral fermions along (x_0,x_1).</description>

      <title>Linear response beyond hydrodynamic poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of writing an effective, linearised theory in small derivatives that reproduces the Mittag-Leffler expansion of a charge current correlator with an arbitrary number of simple poles. We demonstrate how such a framework: can be compatible with hydrostaticity without modification of thermodynamics, properly accounts for the differing notions of smallness in time and space derivatives including setting the lowest order effective equation of motion, and corrects the effective equations in derivatives. As an application, we apply the results to charge fluctuations of the D3/D5 probe brane and quantify how the transport coefficients behave when quasihydrodynamics emerges at large charge density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chamseddine and Mukhanov have promoted the concept of mimetic dark matter as alternative dark matter candidate coming from gravitation. Unfortunately although being very interesting, their proposition turned out to have weakness among which ghost and caustic instabilities. In this paper I propose among the simplest ghost free and caustic free scalar field dark matter extension of their model; a proposition capable of challenging $\Lambda$CDM model or even capable of doing better.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian topological superconductivity from melting Abelian fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) are exotic phases of matter realized at partial filling of a Chern band that host fractionally charged anyon excitations. Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $\nu = 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $\nu = p/(2p+1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories with a large number of long-lived metastable vacua are our only concrete explanation for the puzzling value of the Cosmological Constant (CC). The energy scales where these vacua are realized are unknown. In this work, we consider the possibility that a sector of this landscape of vacua is within experimental reach and discuss its signatures at colliders. We find that striking large-multiplicity final states might have gone undetected due to their relatively small total energy. In particular, this could lead to new exotic Higgs decays, which are both intriguing and challenging to search for. In addition to a general phenomenological analysis of these theories, we also discuss an explicit model where the small values of the CC and the Higgs mass are jointly explained by Weinberg's anthropic argument and a low energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the cosmic space inspired by mass-to-horizon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conception of gravity as an emergent phenomenon, rooted in the thermodynamics of spacetime, offers a radical departure from its geometric description. This paper investigates the emergence of cosmic space by synthesizing two key thermodynamic approaches: the equilibrium perspective, where the first law of thermodynamics is applied to the apparent horizon, and the dynamic perspective of Padmanabhan, where the cosmic space emerges as cosmic time progresses. The central element of our study is the incorporation of a mass-to-horizon entropy relation, $M=\gamma {c^2 L^n}/{G}$, where $M$ denotes the effective mass associated with the system, $L$ corresponds to the cosmological horizon, and $\gamma$ is a constant with dimensions $[L]^{1-n}$. We first use this relation within the Clausius relation and apply the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_h dS_h+WdV$, on the apparent horizon to derive the modified Friedmann equations. Subsequently, we embed the mass-to-horizon entropy relation into Padmanabhan's cosmic emergence proposal, the dependence of the volume change on the degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the boundary, and show its consistency with the thermodynamically derived equations. The successful reconstruction of the modified Friedmann equations through these independent yet convergent thermodynamic routes strongly suggests that the mass-to-horizon entropy is a fundamental bridge between the information-theoretic microstructure of spacetime and its effective cosmological description. Finally, we show that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled for the universe enveloped by the apparent horizon.</description>

      <title>Casimir operators for the relativistic quantum phase space symmetry group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the unification of quantum mechanics and relativity have emphasized the necessity of generalizing classical phase space into a relativistic quantum phase space which is a framework that inherently incorporates the uncertainty principle and relativistic covariance. In this context, the present work considers the derivation of linear and quadratic Casimir operators corresponding to representations of the Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT) group associated with a five-dimensional spacetime of signature (1,4). This LCT group, which emerges naturally as the symmetry group of the relativistic quantum phase space, is isomorphic to the symplectic group Sp(2,8). The latter notably contains the de Sitter group SO(1,4) as a subgroup. This geometric setting provides a unified framework for extending the Standard Model of particle physics while incorporating cosmological features. Previous studies have shown that the LCT group admits both fermionic-like and bosonic-like representations. Within this framework, a novel classification of quarks and leptons, including sterile neutrinos, has also been proposed. In this work, we present a systematic derivation of the linear and quadratic Casimir operators associated with these representations, motivated by their fundamental role in the characterization of symmetry groups in physics. The construction is based on the relations between the LCT group and the pseudo-unitary group U(1,4). Three linears and three quadratics Casimir operators are identified: two corresponding to the fermionic-like representation, two to the bosonic-like representation, and two hybrid operators linking the two representations. The complete eigenvalue spectra and corresponding eigenstates for each operator are subsequently computed and identified</description>

      <title>High-Energy Pion Scattering in Holographic QCD: A Comparison with Experimental Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Polchinski and Strassler [1] and our previous work [2], we study high-energy pion scattering in the holographic QCD hard-wall model. In particular, we focus on comparing our predictions for the angular dependence of $\pi^{+} \pi^{-} \to \pi^{+} \pi^{-}$ scattering with experimental data extracted from the process $\pi^{-} p \to \pi^{+} \pi^{-} n$. Having previously shown that our approach reproduces the constituent counting rule found in QCD, we now observe qualitative agreement between our predictions and the extracted data in the high-energy fixed-angle regime. We also provide predictions for all other 2-to-2 pion scattering processes. Our approach can be extended to a broader range of meson and glueball scattering processes in various holographic QCD models.</description>

      <title>Partner-mode overlap as a symplectic-invariant measure of correlations in Gaussian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a locally symplectic-invariant quantifier of correlations between two different arbitrary modes in bosonic Gaussian systems, denoted by $\mathcal{D}^{\mathrm{sym}}$. This quantity admits a simple geometric interpretation as an overlap between each mode and the purification partner of the other, formulated using the complex-structure description of Gaussian states. The construction builds on the partner-mode framework of Ref.~\cite{agullo_correlation_2025} and can be viewed as a symmetrized extension of earlier overlap-based measures~\cite{osawa2025entanglement}. We formulate a simple necessary and sufficient criterion for two-mode entanglement in Gaussian states in terms of $\mathcal{D}^{\mathrm{sym}}$, placing on firm quantitative footing the intuition that entanglement with a given localized mode `lives' on the spatial support of its partner mode. We illustrate the framework with a numerical analysis of a scalar field in Minkowski spacetime and discuss its extension to multimode systems and mixed Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a two-dimensional bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) paramagnet protected by an on-site $G=\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry, starting from a three-component $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet on a triangular lattice. Within the group-cohomology framework, $H^{3}(G,U(1))\cong \mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 7}$, we focus on a "colorless" cocycle representative obtained by antisymmetrizing the basic $\mathbb{Z}_4$ three-cocycle, and generate the corresponding SPT Hamiltonian via a cocycle-induced nonlocal unitary transformation followed by symmetry averaging. For open geometry, we derive the boundary theory explicitly: one color sector decouples, while the nontrivial edge reduces to an interacting $\mathbb{Z}_4$ chain with next-to-nearest-neighbor constraints that admits a compact dressed-Potts form. Using DMRG we show that the boundary model is gapless, with the lowest gap scaling as $1/L$ and an entanglement-entropy scaling consistent with a conformal field theory of central charge $c=2.191(4)\simeq 11/5$. The rational value $c=11/5$ matches the coset $SU(3)_3/SU(2)_3$, making it a candidate for the continuum description of the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ edge; we outline spectral and symmetry-resolved diagnostics needed to test this identification at the level of conformal towers beyond the central charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study 2+2 direct product spacetimes sourced by separated electromagnetic and Yang--Mills fields within Weyl conformal gravity. We prove that all such configurations admit at least 2 independent, commuting non-null Killing vectors, which we use to find general solutions. As a special case, we obtain a generalization of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem to all spacetimes containing a two-dimensional subspace of constant Gaussian curvature, and we also revisit the original formulation of the theorem. We further analyze the resulting solutions in terms of Weyl equivalence classes. Their connections to known solutions in both Weyl conformal gravity and Einstein gravity are established through conformal relations. We also examine the fundamental physical and geometric properties of the newly obtained configurations and their equivalence classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Pad\'e expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $\phi^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $\phi^4$ theory, the resulting two point Pad\'e approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Pad\'e appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.</description>

      <title>Universal Non-Equilibrium Cascade in QGP Light-Nuclei Formation and Cosmological Bose-Einstein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent ALICE results demonstrate that over 90\% of light nuclei and anti-nuclei ($d$, $\bar d$) observed in heavy-ion collisions originate from a non-equilibrium, multi-stage process: $\Delta$-resonance production, decay into correlated nucleons, and their subsequent coalescence in a cooler hadronic environment. Although the final particle yields appear thermal, the underlying dynamics is strongly time-ordered and highly non-equilibrium. We show that this mechanism exhibits a striking universality with the formation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and associated density spikes in cosmological scalar-field dark-matter scenarios. In both systems -- the quark-gluon plasma near hadronization and the early universe approaching the BEC critical temperature -- the relevant degrees of freedom reorganize through a hierarchical cascade: high-energy modes first convert into intermediate excitations, which then seed low-energy coherent structures once the temperature crosses a threshold. This work highlights an unexpected theoretical bridge between heavy-ion physics and cosmology, suggesting a common class of emergent non-equilibrium phenomena behind structure formation in both extremes.</description>

      <title>Instability of parametrized black hole quasinormal modes in the high-overtone limit via the exact WKB analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of parametrized black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the high-overtone limit. To gain insights into their analytical structure, we apply the exact WKB method, which was recently developed by the same authors. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed in good agreement with the numerical results based on Leaver's method. For specific values of parametrization parameters that characterize deviations from general relativity, we find that the real part of asymptotic QNM frequencies diverges in the high-overtone limit, in sharp contrast to the case of a Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that the convergence of the real parts of high-overtone QNMs is a distinctive feature of general relativity, while parametrized corrections generically lead to divergent spectral behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplace equation on Euclidean flat space admits a discrete radial inversion symmetry. In 1983, Couch and Torrence (CT) found -- surprisingly -- that the massless wave equation continues to display this symmetry on the background of an extremal (and asymptotically flat) black hole, where the inversion interchanges horizon and infinity while preserving the singularity structure of the separated radial mode equation. We revisit this CT inversion symmetry and investigate its possible extensions beyond the extremal (Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Kerr) setting in which it was originally identified. Using the example of the static lukewarm de Sitter black hole, we show that neither the exchange of horizon with infinity, nor the preservation of radial singularities, are essential features needed for a CT inversion to exist. Instead, we interpret CT transformations through their action on photon spheres, providing a unified viewpoint that extends to the (phase-space-dependent) CT inversions of the extremal Kerr-Newman geometry. For scalar fields on that spacetime, we find a simple relation between the fixed point of a CT inversion and the coefficient of superradiant scattering. Finally, we exhibit a hidden CT inversion symmetry that arises in the static limit of the Kerr Laplacian for all spins. Together, these results suggest that CT symmetry may admit a broader generalization than previously understood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graphical method for proving holographic entanglement entropy inequalities (HEIs) in general multipartite systems. By introducing a geometric representation of the entanglement structure, we develop a systematic approach that enables one to visualize and verify the validity of HEIs for any number of subsystems $n$. Several theorems are established to formalize this method, and explicit examples are provided for systems with $n = 4$ to $7$ entangled regions.</description>

      <title>Finite Distance Corrections to Vacuum Birefringence in Strong Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study polarization dependent photon propagation in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes permeated by strong magnetic fields, with the aim of quantifying how finite emission and detection radii modify vacuum birefringence signals. Working in the geometric optics limit of nonlinear electrodynamics, we formulate the two polarization modes as null geodesics of distinct effective (optical) metrics. We then develop a controlled weak-coupling expansion that cleanly separates the standard gravitational deflection from the birefringent contribution induced by the electromagnetic nonlinearity. Using a finite distance Gauss-Bonnet construction on the associated optical manifolds, we derive a general expression for the \emph{differential} bending angle in which the source and observer are kept at arbitrary radii, thereby extending the usual scattering-at-infinity treatment. As benchmark applications, we specialize our results to the Euler-Heisenberg effective action of QED and to Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We find that the observable birefringence is generically reduced by finite-distance truncation of the curvature flux, and we provide explicit correction series suitable for data analysis. For magnetar-motivated dipolar fields, this geometric effect yields a suppression factor that can diminish the predicted polarization-dependent deflection by as much as $\sim 50\%$ for limb emission relative to asymptotic scattering estimates. Our results furnish a necessary finite-distance calibration for interpreting current and future X-ray polarimetry measurements and for placing unbiased constraints on strong-field QED and broader NLED parameters.</description>

      <title>Dissociation driven quarkonium spin alignment in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of spin alignment of quarkonia in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides deep insight into the possible formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The present study investigates the spin alignment of quarkonia induced by dissociation mechanisms arising from medium effects imposed on quarkonia. We implement an effective Hamiltonian with a medium-modified color-singlet potential to incorporate the coupling of quarkonium spin with medium vorticity. This coupling gives rise to spin-dependent dissociation, which we identify as a plausible mechanism contributing to quarkonium spin alignment. Within the ambit of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics, we calculate the spin-dependent decay widths of charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S)) in a rotating thermal medium, including collisional damping and gluonic dissociation effects. We evaluate the observable $\rho_{00}$ for Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV as a function of transverse momentum of the quarkonia, charged particle multiplicity, and medium rotation. The results demonstrate that medium vorticity modifies the quarkonia net decay width and, as a consequence, quarkonia spin alignment gets modified. These findings suggest new directions for understanding spin transport and the microscopic dynamics of vortical QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated to flat sections of oper connections of arbitrary rank on the twice-punctured Riemann sphere with irregular singularities of the mildest type. We construct the solutions in terms of the solutions to a single non-linear integral equation. It follows from this construction that the generating function of the submanifold of opers coincides with the Yang-Yang function of the quantum Toda chain, proving a conjecture by Nekrasov, Rosly and Shatashvili. In this way we may furthermore reformulate the quantization conditions of the Toda chain in terms of the connection problem, for which we also provide a solution. We finally interpret our results as a variant of the Analytic Langlands Correspondence for the real version of the Hitchin system corresponding to the Toda chain.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes inside anisotropic magnetized neutron stars: physical properties and potential observational imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy and magnetic fields. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that neither anisotropy nor magnetic fields affect the traversability of the wormhole. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance, Hawking radiation, and Barrow thermodynamics of Letelier black hole in electromagnetic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation of a static, spherically symmetric Letelier black hole (BH) immersed in an electromagnetic universe (EMU), characterized by the cloud of strings (CoS) parameter $\alpha$ and the EMU parameter $a$. The photon sphere and shadow radius are derived analytically, revealing how both parameters modify the apparent BH silhouette compared to the Schwarzschild case. We extend the shadow analysis to homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma environments, demonstrating systematic reductions in the observed shadow size, and compute the weak gravitational lensing deflection angle in plasma using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The perturbative dynamics are investigated for scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac fields, with quasinormal mode frequencies obtained via the sixth-order WKB approximation and greybody factors calculated using the rigorous bounds method. The resulting Hawking radiation spectra reveal distinct signatures for bosonic and fermionic emission channels. We further analyze quasi-periodic oscillations by deriving the fundamental orbital frequencies and applying both parametric resonance and relativistic precession models, obtaining constraints from observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Massive Spin-2 Particles During Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the minimal gravitational portal for a massive spin-2 dark matter candidate $X_{\mu\nu}$ produced during perturbative reheating. The dark sector couples to the visible sector only via gravity, and we analyze two unavoidable channels: (i) inflaton condensate annihilation, $\phi+\phi \to X+X$, and (ii) thermal scatterings, ${\rm SM}+{\rm SM}\to X+X$, both mediated by graviton exchange. Working in the Fierz-Pauli framework for a free massive spin-2 field of mass $m_2$, we derive the graviton-mediated amplitudes and perform a full helicity decomposition of the final state. The relic abundance is obtained analytically in terms of $m_2$ and the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH}$. In the light mass regime $m_2 \ll m_\phi$ (with $m_\phi$ the inflaton mass during oscillations), production is overwhelmingly dominated by the longitudinal (helicity-0) mode: the $2\to2$ cross section is parametrically enhanced, scaling as $\sim (m_\phi/m_2)^4$, and yields efficient dark matter production despite purely gravitational couplings. Compared to lower-spin cases (spin-$0$, $1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$), massive spin-$2$ production is substantially more efficient for the same reheating history. Over most of the parameter space the inflaton condensate channel dominates the yield, while the thermal contribution is negligible. Avoiding overproduction typically requires either a relatively low $T_{\rm RH}$ or a spin-$2$ mass near threshold, $m_2 \lesssim m_\phi$. This places the spin-$2$ portal on similar footing to other higher spins in reheating scenarios, while emphasizing the central role of the helicity-$0$ mode and the reheating history in setting the dark matter density.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter with logarithmic nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If dark matter is composed of massive bosons, a Bose-Einstein Condensation process must have occurred during the cosmological evolution. Therefore, galactic dark matter may be in a form of a self-gravitating condensate, in the presence of self-interactions. We consider the possibility that the self-interacting potential of the condensate dark matter is of the logarithmic form. In order to describe the condensate dark matter we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation. With the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the equation of state of the condensate, which has the form of the ideal gas equation of state, with the pressure proportional to the dark matter density. The basic equation describing the density distribution of the static condensate is derived, and its solution is obtained in the form of a series solution, constructed with the help of the Adomian Decomposition Method. To test the model we consider the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter scenario, by using a sample from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data. The fit of the theoretical predictions of the rotation curves with the observational data indicate that the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter model gives an acceptable description of the SPARC data, and thus it may be considered as a possible candidate for the in depth understanding of the dark matter properties.</description>

      <title>On the logarithmic Love number of black holes beyond general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers and other response coefficients of black holes sometimes exhibit a logarithmic dependence on scale, or 'running'. We clarify that this coefficient is directly calculable from the structure of the equation obeyed by the field perturbation, and requires no knowledge of the full solution. The derived formula allows us to establish some general results on the existence of logarithmic running. In particular, we show that any static and spherically symmetric spacetime that modifies the Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions in a perturbative way must have non-zero logarithmic Love numbers. This applies for instance to all regular black hole metrics. On the other hand, our analysis highlights the importance of the perturbativity assumption: without it, we find explicit black hole solutions beyond general relativity with exactly zero running. We also illustrate the advantage of our method by recovering and extending the known results for the Hayward metric.</description>

      <title>Search for Light Neutral Scalar in the Georgi-Machacek Model with Forward Detectors at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived particle (LLP) is one of the well-motivated targets for current collider experiments searching for the physics beyond the Standard Model. In recent years, many dedicated detectors have been developed for such scenarios which are designed to extend the sensitivity to weakly coupled particles with macroscopic $c\tau$. In this work, we investigate the LLP signatures of the neutral component of the fermiophobic fiveplet $H_5^0$ in the Georgi-Machacek model. Due to its fermiophobic nature at tree level, it possesses suppressed decay widths in the low mass region and can naturally be long-lived over a wide region of parameter space. We show that $H_5^0$ can be produced with an appreciable flux in the forward region from the meson decay through loop-induced couplings leading to observable LLP signatures in forward detectors. We evaluate the sensitivity of representative forward detectors to this scenario and compare the result with existing constraints from terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Our results demonstrate that the forward detectors can probe the $s_H$ down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ for sub-GeV scalar masses, and hence providing a powerful and complementary probe of the extended Higgs sectors that is inaccessible to conventional searches.</description>

      <title>Real-time propagators resummed with nontrivial boundary wavefunctions in a constant electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the derivation of an alternative representation of the real-time in-in formalism under a spatially homogeneous and time independent electric field. Because the system exhibits instability associated with pair production of particles and antipartiles, the perturbation theory should be reorganized depending on the choice of the reference vacuum. We recast the boundary wavefunctions into the quadratic self-energy-like terms in the functional integration formalism. The resulting generating functional in the modified in-in formalism leads to the propagators that resum infinite diagrams necessary to capture the vacuum-instability effects. The proper-time representations of the propagators reproduce the known expressions from the canonical operator formalism, but our derivation based on the generating functional along the closed-time path clarifies the origin of the addtional proper-time contour and provides a better physical understanding. Finally, as a concrete example of the application, we compute the in-in expectation value of the vector current in a constant electric field, and find that the one-loop calculation results in the expression consistent with the physical intuition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for exact solutions describing asymptotically FLRW compact objects in General Relativity (GR) remains a notoriously challenging problem. To a large extent, progress has been restricted to the spherically symmetric sector, with the exception of the Kerr-de Sitter and Thakhurta solutions. In this work, we present two new results that advance the description of axisymmetric compact objects embedded in a cosmological background. We first introduce a new solution-generating technique allowing one to construct non-stationary and axisymmetric solutions of the self-interacting Einstein-Scalar system. Using this method, we present the first exact solution which describes a dynamical axisymmetric black (or white) hole embedded in an expanding or contracting cosmology. We provide a detailed investigation of its properties, and in particular its dynamical trapping (or anti-trapping) horizons. To that end, we use the mean curvature vector (MCV) which stands as a natural generalization of the Kodama vector beyond spherical symmetry. The norm of this vector provides a foliation-independent quantity to locate the trapped/anti-trapped and untrapped regions and characterize the causal nature of a given geometry without specific symmetry requirement. The solution-generating method and the techniques to analyze the new solutions provide new powerful tools to further explore the description and the phenomenology of dynamical compact objects embedded in cosmology, in particular those of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Circular Disformal Kerr: An Exact Rotating Black Hole Beyond GR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kerr solution is the cornerstone of General Relativity (GR) for modelling astrophysical rotating black holes and for testing GR through gravitational-wave observations and black hole imaging. Understanding how the Kerr geometry is modified in alternative theories of gravity is therefore a crucial step toward constraining possible deviations from GR. Despite their importance, exact analytical solutions describing rotating black holes in modified gravity are rare, limiting our ability to explore novel phenomenology and to design robust observational tests of new physics. In this work, we present a new exact rotating black hole solution within a specific scalar-tensor theory belonging to the Horndeski class. The solution is obtained via a disformal transformation acting on a Kerr stealth black hole. Crucially, unlike previous constructions, the disformal transformation of our chosen seed configuration preserves circularity, ensuring that many of the geometrical and physical properties that make the Kerr spacetime so compelling are retained. We refer to the resulting geometry as the Circular Disformal Kerr solution. Remarkably, key features such as the structure of Killing horizons, the ergosphere, and the absence of causality violations closely mirror those of the Kerr metric. The spacetime is algebraically general, corresponding to Petrov type I. This new exact solution therefore provides a rare example of a rotating black hole beyond GR that closely mimics the Kerr geometry, offering a valuable theoretical laboratory to investigate the phenomenology of Kerr-like black holes in modified gravity.</description>

Abstract: In planar chiral magnets, the competition of the positive definite Heisenberg exchange and Zeeman energies with the indefinite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) energy allows for the possibility of negative energy ground states, and leads to an intricate dependence of the ground states on the parameters of the theory. In this paper, we consider arbitrary spiralization tensors for the DMI interaction and arbitrary directions for the external magnetic field, and study the nature of the ground states in this parameter space, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Classifying ground states by their symmetry into ferromagnetic (invariant under under arbitrary translations in the plane), spiral (invariant under arbitrary translations in one direction) and skyrmion lattice ground states (invariant under a two dimensional lattice group), we give a complete description of the phase diagram of this class of theories.</description>

      <title>Extracting quantum field theory dynamics from an approximate ground state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear-programming method to extract dynamical information from static ground-state correlators in quantum field theory. We recast the K\"all\'en-Lehmann inversion as a convex optimization problem, in a spirit similar to the recent approach of Lawrence [arXiv:2408.11766]. This produces robust estimates of the smeared spectral density, the real-time propagator, and the mass gap directly from an approximate equal-time two-point function, and simultaneously yields an \emph{a posteriori} lower bound on the correlation-function error. We test the method on the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ model, using a variational approximation to the vacuum -- relativistic continuous matrix product states -- that provides accurate correlators in the continuum and thermodynamic limits. The resulting mass gaps agree with renormalized Hamiltonian truncation and Borel-resummed perturbation theory across a wide range of couplings, demonstrating that accurate dynamical data can be recovered from a single equal-time slice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a higher lattice gauge theory based on the representation of 2-groups described by a category of crossed modules on a lattice model described by path 2-groupoids. Using these lattice gauge representations, an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in 3+1 dimensions is constructed. We show that the ground states of this model are topological observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawking's free field theory is expected to break down after Page time. In previous work, we have shown that a primary dynamical reason for this breakdown is the dominance of graviton fluctuations of the horizon that mediate scattering processes. In this article, we present a toolbox for such `black hole scattering' computations. The toolbox comprises of explicit expressions for the graviton propagator near the horizon in an angular momentum basis for all angular momentum modes of either parity, the leading interaction rules, and most importantly a rewriting of the theory in terms of a scalar theory with an interesting four-vertex. We demonstrate how this rewriting drastically reduces the number of diagrams to be calculated in the original formulation. Finally and perhaps most remarkably, we observe that the black hole entropy appears to emerge from the multiplicity of external legs of the dominant $2\rightarrow2N$ amplitudes in this theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and factorization in axion-de Sitter universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extremal codimension-two areas and late-time bulk correlators between a pair of asymptotically de Sitter space universes connected through an Euclidean axion wormhole, in arbitrary dimensions. Assuming the validity of the de Sitter (dS)/conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence, we describe factorized Hilbert spaces for the putative boundary theories at $\mathcal{I}^+$ in each of the universes based on the asymptotically dS isometries. This allow us to we interpret the extremal areas as complex-valued holographic entanglement entropy between the microscopic duals. Later, we evaluate two-point correlation functions for heavy particles detected near $\mathcal{I}^+$. The Euclidean wormhole saddle point is responsible for finiteness of the correlators. The results are compatible with the boundary dual being non-unitary and having a large Hilbert space dimension. At last, we dimensionally reduce these geometries in terms of dilaton-gravity theory with conformally coupled matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we demonstrate, using several regression techniques, that the remaining independent Hodge numbers of complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds and five-folds can be machine learned from $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$. Consequently, we combine the Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$ from the complete intersection Calabi-Yau three-folds, four-folds, and five-folds into a single dataset. We then implement various classification algorithms on this dataset. For example, Gaussian process and naive Bayes classifiers both achieve $100\%$ accuracy in binary classification between three-folds and four-folds. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a special corner is identified in the Calabi-Yau four-fold landscape (characterized by $15 \leq h^{1,1} \leq 30$ and $95 \leq h^{2,1} \leq 100$) during multiclass classification. Furthermore, the highest accuracy $1.00000$, in classifying Calabi-Yau three-folds, four-folds, and five-folds is obtained using the naive Bayes classifier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction map in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open question in AdS/CFT is how to reconstruct semiclassical bulk operators precisely enough that non-perturbative quantum effects can be computed. We propose a set of physically-motivated requirements for such a reconstruction map, and explicitly construct a map satisfying these requirements in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. Our map is found by canonically quantizing "action-angle" variables for JT gravity, which are chosen to ensure that the spectrum of the fundamental quantum theory matches known results from the gravitational path integral. We then study unitary quantum dynamics in this theory, and obtain analytical predictions for the dynamics of the wormhole length, including its quantum fluctuations, leveraging techniques from quantum ergodicity theory. Level repulsion in the non-perturbative JT spectrum implies that the average wormhole length is non-monotonic in time, that fluctuations in wormhole length are non-perturbatively suppressed until nearly the Heisenberg time, and that the late-time-evolved Hartle-Hawking state has a heavy-tailed distribution of lengths. We discuss the implications of our results for the "complexity = volume" conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the noncompact open ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain, the eigenfunctions of the special matrix element of monodromy matrix are constructed. The key ingredients of the whole construction are local Yang-Baxter $\mathcal{R}$-operators, $Q$-operator and raising operators obtained by reduction from the $Q$-operator. The calculation of various scalar products and the proof of orthogonality are based on the properties of $Q$-operator and demonstrate its hidden role. The symmetry of eigenfunctions with respect to reflection of the spin variable $s \to 1-s$ is established. The Mellin-Barnes representation for eigenfunctions is derived and equivalence with initial coordinate representation is proved. The transformation from one representation to another is grounded on the application of $A$-type Gustafson integral generalized to the complex field.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric BMS$_4$ Algebras Revisited: Electric/Magnetic Superalgebras and Free Field Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic classification of supersymmetric extensions of the BMS$_4$ algebra and their realizations in free field theories. By requiring that supercharges admit finite-dimensional subsectors, we identify ten distinct electric super BMS$_4$ algebras and six magnetic ones. The electric case is characterized by supercharge anticommutators closing on supertranslations, while the magnetic case necessarily involves superrotations. To realize these algebras in free field theories, we follow a constructive procedure: first identify the modes bilinears of which generate the symmetry algebra, then determine the fields with appropriate transformation properties under the BMS$_4$ algebra, and finally construct consistent theories whose equations of motion admit the desired supersymmetry. Notably, $R$-symmetry with nonvanishing spin is essential for the Type II-II, Type I-II, and Type II-I magnetic super BMS$_4$ algebras, shedding new light on spacetime structure of string theory for flat holography. Moreover, in the Type I-I theory, $R$-symmetry relates electric and magnetic scalars, indicating their equal significance. In addition, $R$-symmetry maps the electric scalar to a spin-$1$ field and vice versa, offering a novel perspective on supersymmetric extensions of soft theorems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an in-depth investigation of the thermodynamic relations for AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is presented. This investigation is conducted within both the restricted phase space (RPS) and the conformal field theory (CFT) frameworks. The influence of non-extensive forms of entropy is also systematically examined. Our results demonstrate that the Goon-Penco (GP) relation for charged AdS black holes holds within both the RPS and CFT frameworks, irrespective of the specific form of entropy modification. The conclusion of the present study demonstrates that the GP relation constitutes a universal thermodynamic relation.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric truncation of N=3 dilaton Weyl multiplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform all possible supersymmetric truncations of the four-dimensional N=3 dilaton Weyl multiplet, which realizes an R-symmetry $SU(2) \times U(1) \times U(1)$, to N=2. A particular truncation procedure does not break any of the R-symmetries and leads to the known N=2 vector-dilaton Weyl multiplet and the N=2 vector multiplet. A different truncation procedure breaks the SU(2) part of the R-symmetry to U(1) and leads to a 32+32 off-shell representation of N=2 conformal supergravity with a partially broken R-symmetry. Independently, we construct another 32+32 off-shell multiplet in N=2 conformal supergravity by coupling the N=2 scalar-tensor multiplet to the N=2 standard Weyl multiplet and using the scalar fields present in the scalar-tensor multiplet to break the SU(2) R-symmetry to U(1). We then establish the equivalence between these two multiplets through a mapping. We observe that this 32+32 multiplet is gauge equivalent to a Poincar\'e supergravity multiplet as it has all the compensators necessary to go from conformal supergravity to Poincar\'e supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</description>

      <title>Integrable Sigma Models and Universal Root $T\bar{T}$ Deformation via Courant-Hilbert Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified Courant--Hilbert framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable sigma models deformed by two couplings: a marginal one $\gamma$ and an irrelevant one $\lambda$. The integrability condition is encoded in a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) for two invariants $(P_1, P_2)$, whose general solution could be expressed through an arbitrary generating function $\ell(\tau)$. This formulation encompasses and extends known models, such as ModMax and Born-Infeld, while introducing new classes of solvable models with closed-form Lagrangians, including those with logarithmic and $q$-deformations. All resulting theories obey a universal root-$T\overline{T}$ flow equation, consistent under dimensional reduction from four-dimensional duality-invariant electrodynamics. Using perturbative expansions, we recover ModMax in the free limit, determine the $\gamma$-dependence of the coupling functions, and show how different flow equations, including a single-trace form, naturally emerge. Our results reveal deep structural connections between self-duality, integrability, and deformation dynamics across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>A New Supersymmetry Index for the D1-D5 CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new supersymmetry index for the D1-D5 CFT for $T^4$, relevant to the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. In a novel formulation of symmetric orbifold CFTs based on the Schur-Weyl duality, we show how this index can be naturally described and its protection is argued based on the detailed nature of exactly marginal operators in these theories. This index is a one-parameter generalization of the standard index and gives more fine-grained information about the structure of microstates than previously available. We demonstrate precise matching of the new index between supergravity and CFT below the black-hole threshold, where the standard index -- the modified elliptic genus -- is trivial. Above the threshold, we uncover a decomposition of black-hole microstates into distinct sectors, invisible to the modified elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>Evolution With(out) Time: Relational Holography &amp; BPS Complexity Growth in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do we describe non-trivial bulk measurements relative to an observer (i.e. relationally) when both the observer and the system it probes may/may not evolve in time? How can we interpret this holographically; particularly for zero-energy BPS states in supersymmetric theories? We address these questions, in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ double-scaled SYK model and its putative bulk dual by: (i) formulating a holographic procedure in the language of quantum reference frames to gravitationally dress bulk observables to ``clocks'' parametrized by both boundary time and R-charge; and (ii) proposing a \emph{new measure of Krylov complexity} with R-charge in the boundary theory that probes zero-energy BPS states. Holographically, this proposal reproduces a relational bulk observable, a BPS wormhole length. We contrast this to the Krylov complexity for Hartle-Hawking states with non-trivial time flow. The latter reproduces the same observable as for the bosonic DSSYK in the semiclassical limit, while its quantum fluctuations can capture supersymmetric corrections depending on the specific initial state.</description>

Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of co-algebra, co-algebraic Wess-Zumino-Witten formulation of Lagrangian Field Theory and the Homotopy transfer theorem to many strings and particle systems. We discuss in detail the construction of higher dimensional co-algebras and the computational methods derived from them with a special interest regarding String Field Theory and Quantum Field Theory. As a result of this work we will be able to effortlessly extend some of the newly developed tools to study the algebraic structure, compute effective actions and compute scattering amplitudes of more complicated QFTs.</description>

      <title>The Unitary Architecture of Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a bootstrap problem for renormalization. Working in the massless four-dimensional O$(N)$ model and the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, we prove that unitarity leads to all-loop recursion relations between coefficients of scattering amplitudes with different multiplicities. These turn out to be equivalent to the identities imposed by renormalization of the coupling and the wavefunction through subleading logarithmic order, except with different initial conditions. Matching the initial conditions thus fixes the beta function and wavefunction anomalous dimension to these orders. We explain how to connect this new on-shell renormalization picture with the standard renormalized perturbation theory, highlighting a rich interplay between finiteness, dimensional regularization, and unitarity cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>A Unified Causal Framework for Nonlinear Electrodynamics Black Hole from Courant-Hilbert Approach: Thermodynamics and Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing black hole thermodynamics and spacetime structure in Einstein gravity coupled to causal nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) in asymptotically anti-de Sitter backgrounds. The electromagnetic sector is governed by a Generalized Nonlinear Electrodynamics (GNED) Lagrangian obtained from a root-$T\bar T$ deformation constructed via the Courant-Hilbert approach, ensuring both duality invariance and causal propagation. This theory contains ModMax, Generalized Born-Infeld (GBI), and self-dual logarithmic electrodynamics as continuous limits. Within this framework we obtain exact charged AdS black hole solutions and perform a detailed study of their thermodynamic properties, including mass, temperature, entropy, and free energy. The resulting phase structure exhibits van der~Waals-type transitions between small and large black holes and features a characteristic swallowtail in the free energy at the critical point.
  we further investigate the internal geometry, showing that the nature of the central singularity is determined by the matter fields that source the spacetime. An analysis of the Kretschmann scalar reveals how mass and electric charge jointly govern curvature divergence in ModMax black holes. We derive an explicit charge-to-mass bound within a causal logarithmic electrodynamic theory. This extends the finite self-energy property of the point charge beyond the standard Born-Infeld model. This bound cleanly distinguishes black holes from naked singularities, showing that naked singularities occur precisely when the mass parameter is smaller than the electromagnetic self-energy of the point charge. This provides a clear energetic criterion for horizon formation in the absence of a Cauchy horizon.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Expansion formula of one-loop Einstein-Yang-Mills integrand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the algebraic consistency construction of one-loop Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators for Yang-Mills (YM) and Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) theories, we explore the expansion formula of one-loop Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) integrands (with a gluon loop) in terms of conventional one-loop YM integrands with quadratic propagators. We first express the EYM integrand by tree-level amplitudes according to the forward limit approach. Employing a two-step expansion strategy, the gluon-loop EYM integrand is decomposed into tree-level YM amplitudes under the forward limit, which are subsequently expanded into tree-level bi-adjoint scalar (BS) ones. We then prove that when the kinematic coefficients in both expansion steps satisfy the one-loop consistency conditions, the EYM integrand is finally expanded as a combination of YM integrands with quadratic propagators. The coefficients in this expansion formula coincide exactly with those in the expansion formula for YMS integrands. This correspondence highlights a shared kinematic structure, providing the proper foundation for constructing BCJ numerators in both YMS and EYM theories at one loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the phase space of the soft sector of asymptotically flat gravity in four spacetime dimensions can be identified with that of a spherically symmetric finite casual diamond in Minkowski spacetime. The leading soft graviton mode is geometrically identified with the radial fluctuation of the causal diamond size, while the Goldstone mode involves both the radial fluctuation and its symplectic partner. This allows us to relate the radial fluctuations of the causal diamond with the asymptotic transverse fluctuations parametrized by the soft modes.</description>

Abstract: We perform a Wick rotation and analytic continuation from global AdS$_{d+1}$ to static dS$_{d+1}$, yielding CFT$_d$ generators with a nonstandard adjoint action tied to dS bulk coordinates. To reproduce the real-scalar two-point function, we introduce a global defect operator that twists the inner product. We further show that $PT$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in CFT$_2$ vacua with a central charge having an imaginary part. Finally, we derive integral identities for bulk and defect correlators, providing a unified framework for computing CFT$_d$ observables in the presence of global and local defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally prepared states are quantum field theoretic states prepared by gravitational path integrals with spatial boundaries that have fixed boundary conditions for gravity but not for matter fields. They can be interpreted as quantum field theoretic states of closed universes encoding quantum gravitational effects of the past. We propose a method of modelling gravitationally prepared states in two dimensions with random matrix product states (RMPS). Such RMPS models allow us to exactly define and compute contributions of higher topologies and replica geometries in the gravitationally prepared state to all orders. We show that the bra-ket wormhole phase transition, a crucial physical property of gravitationally prepared states, is ensured if the transfer matrix of the RMPS satisfies the spectral gapping property, which we define, and define a class of models called $\mathrm{O}(k)$ models satisfying this property. A novel advantage of RMPS models is that they allow us to compute the effects of off-shell wormholes, i.e., wormhole topologies without semiclassical solutions. In particular, using RMPS models, we find that off-shell wormholes lead to nonzero long-distance correlators in gravitationally prepared states. We also define RMPS models in continuous space, and discuss implications for studying de Sitter gravitationally prepared states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02387v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host a topological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in DESI DR2 and current cosmological dataset?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on an interacting dark matter-dark energy scenario motivated by string compactification, where a scalar field adiabatically tracks the minimum of an effective potential sourced by dark matter density. In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions such that the field rests at effective potential minima today. We perform a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using a combination of datasets, including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our analysis shows a mild preference for a higher non-zero dark sector coupling, compared to earlier works on similar models, for two particular combinations of datasets: (i) Planck + DESI DR2 BAO +.Pantheon+, (ii) Planck + SDSS BAO + Pantheon+ + SH$0$ES. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields weak and positive evidence in favor of the model over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta$AIC= $-0.75, -2.41$ respectively. This model remains consistent with a phantom crossing at redshift $z\sim 0.5$, in agreement with the trend indicated by DESI observations. However, due to the settlement of the scalar field at the minima of the effective potential at the present epoch, the effective dark energy equation of state asymptotically approaches $w_{\rm eff}\to -1$. leading to only weak evidence in favor of this model when analyzed using the DESI DR2 dataset.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for CSS and fractonic lattice models and dualities via cluster state measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Time Non-locality in Dark Matter and LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the intriguing phenomenon of time non-locality in the evolution of dark matter and Large Scale Structure (LSS). Recently in\,\cite{Donath:2023sav}, it was shown that time non-locality emerges in bias tracer fluctuations, which are $SO(3)$ scalars in real space, at fifth order in the perturbation expansion in dark matter overdensity. We demonstrate that by breaking the symmetry down to $SO(2)$, which is the case whenever line-of-sight effects become important, such as for flux fluctuations in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest, the temporal non-locality appears at the third order in expansion. Additionally, within the framework of EFTofLSS, we demonstrate that time non-locality manifests in the effective stress tensor of dark matter, which is a second rank tensor under $SO(3)$ transformations, again at the third order in dark matter overdensity. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the standard $\Pi$ basis\,\cite{Mirbabayi:2014zca} in handling time non-local operators.</description>

      <title>Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalues of the quantum state. The conventional constant $ \tfrac{1}{4} $ is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient $\frac{(\lambda_{\max} + \lambda_{\min})^2}{4(\lambda_{\max} - \lambda_{\min})^2}$, where $ \lambda_{\max} $ and $ \lambda_{\min}$ denote the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator $\rho$, respectively. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement.Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson's relation fails to detect. In addition, our result also provides a strict generalization of the Schr\"oedinger's uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus,thereby generalizing the Arthurs--Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in critical $\mathrm{O}(N)$ models from non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\mathrm{O}(N)$ vector models in three dimensions, when defined in a geometry with a compact direction and tuned to criticality, exhibit long-range fluctuations which induce a Casimir effect. The strength of the resulting interaction is encoded in the excess free-energy density, which depends on a universal coefficient: the Casimir amplitude. We present a high-precision numerical calculation of the latter, by means of a novel non-equilibrium Monte Carlo algorithm, and compare our findings with results obtained from large-$N$ expansions and from the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>The Sound of an Orbit: A Quantum Spectrum at the ISCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum signature of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), a region of profound importance in black hole astrophysics. By modeling an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in the Boulware vacuum, we calculate the excitation rate for a detector following a circular geodesic at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stark contrast to the continuous thermal spectra associated with static or infalling observers, our analysis reveals a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum characterized by a discrete "frequency comb" of sharp, resonant peaks. We show that the locations of these peaks are determined by the orbital frequency at the ISCO, while their intensity increases dramatically as the orbit approaches this final stability boundary. This distinct spectral signature offers a novel theoretical probe of the quantum vacuum in a strong-field gravitational regime and provides a clear distinction between the quantum phenomena experienced by observers on different trajectories. Our findings have potential implications for interpreting the emission spectra from accretion disks and open new avenues for exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Fermi liquids and cuprate phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20164v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in spin density wave theory. Magnetotransport measurements, including observation of the Yamaji angle, show clear evidence of hole pocket quasiparticles which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and are consistent with the FL* description.
  The FL* phase of a single-band model is described using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid (FL) at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of the FL*-FL metal-metal transition without a symmetry-breaking order parameter, using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model to two spatial dimensions.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>

      <title>Exponential quintessence with momentum coupling to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.06$ eV ($\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>SO(3) real algebra method for SU(3) QCD at finite baryon-number densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities, we propose the ``SO(3) real algebra method'', in which the SU(3) gauge variable is divided into the SO(3) and SU(3)/SO(3) parts. In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly among the sampled gauge configurations for a set of parameters (e.g., volume, chemical potential, and quark mass), then SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible.</description>

      <title>Consistent Regularization of Signature-Changing BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetime singularities represent a fundamental challenge in gravitational physics. We present a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes based on the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, where the signature transitions from Lorentzian $(-,+,+)$ to Euclidean $(+,+,+)$ at the horizon. We identify and rectify a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that respects distribution theory. This produces a vacuum solution free of surface layers and impulsive gravitational waves. Geodesic analysis reveals that radially infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, effectively preventing access to the would-be singularity while maintaining finite curvature invariants throughout the spacetime. We further establish the physical robustness of the geometry by demonstrating linear stability against gravitational perturbations, showing that quantum scalar field propagation remains unitary and well-defined across the signature change, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ region as a topological boundary rather than a curvature singularity. Our work establishes atemporality via signature change as a mathematically rigorous mechanism for \emph{singularity avoidance} in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reduction of dynamical systems which are invariant under changes of global scale is well-understood, for classical theories of particles, and fields. The excision of the superfluous degree of freedom describing such a scale leads to a dynamically-equivalent theory, which is frictional in nature. In this article, we extend the formalism to physical models, of both particles and fields, described by singular Lagrangians. Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$. The results obtained are subsequently applied to a number of physically-motivated examples, as well as a discussion presented on the implications of our work for classical General Relativity.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of preferred structures in quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the possibilities offered by Hilbert space fundamentalism, an attitude towards quantum physics according to which all physical structures (e.g. subsystems, locality, spacetime, preferred observables) should emerge from minimal quantum ingredients (typically a Hilbert space, Hamiltonian, and state). As a case study, we first mainly focus on the specific question of whether the Hamiltonian can uniquely determine a tensor product structure, a crucial challenge in the growing field of quantum mereology. The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version. We then propose a correct mathematical way to address the general problem of preferred structures in quantum theory, relative to the characterization of emergent objects by unitary-invariant properties. Finally, we apply this formalism in the particular case we started with, and show that a Hamiltonian and a state are enough structure to uniquely select a preferred tensor product structure.</description>

      <title>Relativistic motion through a thermal bath as a thermodynamic resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a localized quantum system following an arbitrary stationary trajectory and weakly interacting with a stationary thermal bath of a massless scalar field is generically driven into a non-Gibbs steady state by relative motion alone, even without external driving or multiple baths. Relative motion between the system and the bath modifies the standard Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation, preventing relaxation to a Gibbs state. The resulting steady states fall into two distinct classes: (i) nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) with persistent probability currents, and (ii) current-free non-Gibbs steady states characterized by a frequency-dependent effective inverse temperature. We then focus on the simplest stationary trajectory, namely uniform relativistic motion with respect to a thermal bath. Using a three-level system as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that the former class can function as noisy stochastic clocks, while the latter possesses finite nonequilibrium free energy, enabling work extraction or storage, highlighting their potential as quantum batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological inflation for the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the Higgs potential function and the Gauss-Bonnet term coupled with the Higgs scalar field through a dilaton-like coupling. Then, using the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and considering the appropriate slow-roll parameters, we derive the necessary equations of motion. In the proposed model, since the e-folding integral cannot be easily solved analytically, we first utilize a well-known Taylor expansion. Then, with a certain range of values derived for the model parameters, utilizing a mixture of several diagrams and numerical analysis methods, we obtain results for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index that are in good agreement the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6, w within the acceptable range of the e-folding values. Also, in the absence of the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that the inflationary observables are roughly the same as the predictions of the chaotic inflation model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal Casimir effect for a massless scalar field in the curved spacetime of a neutron star within the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism. Starting from the renormalized energy-momentum tensor, we generalize the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include gravitational redshift and curvature corrections governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) metric. Finite temperature and spatial compactification are introduced simultaneously, allowing a unified and consistent treatment of both vacuum and thermal contributions inside and outside the star. Analytical expressions are derived for the high- and low-temperature limits, showing explicitly how curvature and redshift modify the characteristic $T^4$ dependence of thermal radiation. The results reveal that strong gravity significantly alters the local energy density and pressure, demonstrating the nontrivial interplay between quantum vacuum fluctuations and compact astrophysical geometries. A polytropic model is considered to perform numerical analyses, highlighting the influence of the spacetime background on vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Delayed Scaling of Multi-Type Cosmic F- and D-strings in VOS Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory. We analytically calculate the scaling string density as a function of the reconnection probabilities, and confirm our results with numerical calculations. We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Subsystems (in)dependence in GIE proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that detecting entanglement between two spatially superposed masses would establish the quantum nature of gravity. However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such "joint" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity.</description>
