      <title>Higher order electroweak radiative corrections in lepton-proton scattering using covariant approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform detailed calculations of electroweak radiative corrections to parity violating lepton scattering with a proton target up to quadratic and reducible two-loop level using a covariant approach. Our numerical results are presented at energies relevant for a variety of existing and proposed experimental programs such as Qweak, P2, MOLLER, MUSE, and experiments at the EIC. Analysis shows that such corrections at the Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) are quite significant and have to be included in searches of physics beyond the standard model, matching the increasing precision of the future experimental programs at low-energy scales.</description>

      <title>Boosting VBF Reconstruction at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward muon detection at high-energy muon colliders is crucial for resolving the underlying electroweak process. This work proposes a novel strategy using asymmetric beam energies to boost one of the forward muons into the detector acceptance, enhancing the ability to distinguish between $W$- and $Z$-initiated vector boson fusion processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an asymmetric collider using VBF Higgs production at 3 and 10 TeV muon colliders with modest boost asymmetries. Asymmetric beam configurations can partially recover the physics potential lost in forward regions when detector coverage is limited.</description>

      <title>The goofy-symmetric Standard Model and the Hierarchy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of so-called "goofy" symmetries has been shown to lead to renormalization-group stable relations between parameters in two-Higgs-Doublet Models, not known before. In this work we investigate goofy transformations in the Standard Model (SM), extending them to the fermion sector. We show that the SM action is goofy "symmetric", if the Higgs mass term vanishes, while other SM interactions are allowed. Goofy symmetry could thus add another option to the very few means to successfully forbid the Higgs mass term, providing an alternative to conformal symmetry or shift symmetry. We further consider how electroweak symmetry breaking can be realized in the goofy symmetric SM via higher dimensional operators or an extended scalar sector. A viable Higgs mass can be obtained via spontaneous breaking of goofy symmetry, which can be realized via operators that would not be allowed by shift symmetry or conformal symmetry. We find that goofy-symmetric extensions of the SM are strongly constrained, but offer for example a straightforward dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound on Parity Breaking Scale for Doublet WIMP Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter in a Parity solution to the strong CP problem. The WIMP phenomenology can be drastically affected by the presence of Parity partners of the WIMP and electroweak gauge bosons. We focus on a Parity extension of $SU(2)_L$-doublet fermion dark matter, identify the viable parameter space, and derive the predictions of the theory. We find that the Parity symmetry breaking scale is bounded from above, with the bound given by $25-60$ TeV, depending on whether or not dark matter and its Parity partner coannihilate with each other. The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, future colliders, and direct and indirect detection experiments can probe the parameter space further, with correlated signal rates.</description>

      <title>New Physics in inclusive semileptonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inclusive semileptonic $\bar{B}\to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}$ decays ($\ell = e,\mu$) in the presence of generic physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that is heavy compared to the $b$-quark mass. Its effect is encoded in the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators of the Weak Effective Theory (WET). We compute the resulting BSM contributions to the experimentally measured kinematic moments and the total decay rate through order $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^3/m_b^3)$ in the Heavy Quark Expansion, as well as the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ corrections for the right-handed vector current. We then perform fits to the full set of available inclusive measurements in several single-mediator scenarios and in the full WET basis. We find qualitatively new bounds in several of these scenarios, complementary to and competitive with constraints from exclusive decays.</description>

      <title>Supernova cooling from neutrino-devouring dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova cooling provides a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), in particular for new, light states interacting feebly with SM particles. In this work, we investigate for the first time the production of fermionic dark matter (DM) via the neutrino-devouring process inside a core-collapse supernova, which contributes to the excessive cooling. By incorporating state-of-the-art supernova simulation data and the full time evolution information, we derive stringent and robust limits on DM interactions. We exclude the cross sections down to $10^{-51}-10^{-58}$ cm$^2$ in the keV-MeV mass range for DM-electron scattering, and $10^{-49}-10^{-56}$ cm$^2$ in the 0.1-100 MeV mass range for DM-nucleon scattering, supplemented by complementary constraints from cosmology, astrophysics, LHC and direct detection experiments in the larger cross section regime. We also close almost the entire window in which fermionic DM constitutes $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of DM for its coupling to electrons in the keV-MeV mass range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These proceedings review the application of Bayesian inference to high momentum transfer probes of the quark--gluon plasma (QGP). Bayesian inference techniques are introduced, highlighting critical components to consider when comparing analyses. Recent calibrations using hadron observables are described, illustrating the importance of the choice of parametrization. Additional recent analyses that characterize the impact of the inclusion of jet observables, as well as soft-hard correlations, are reviewed. Finally, lessons learned from these analyses and important questions for the future are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of near-threshold states with repulsive Coulomb interaction combined with short-range potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of near-threshold states in a system with a repulsive Coulomb interaction combined with a short-range potential, using the compositeness. We construct a model in which the eigenmomentum is expressed in terms of three observables: the Coulomb scattering length, the Coulomb effective range, and the Bohr radius. In the presence of the Coulomb interaction, a bound state directly goes into a resonance as parameters are varied, bypassing a virtual state, in contrast to the case with only the short-range interaction. We show that the compositeness of near-threshold states can be expressed solely in terms of these observables. When the magnitude of the Coulomb effective range is much smaller than that of the Bohr radius, both shallow bound states and near-threshold resonances exhibit common structures with large compositeness, reflecting the remnant of the low-energy universality.</description>

      <title>Role of meson exchange and final-state interaction in $J/\psi$-meson photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $J/\psi$ photoproduction off the nucleon using a dynamical model based on a Hamiltonian framework. First, Pomeron exchange is regarded as a background contribution that accounts for the gradual rise of the total cross section with increasing beam energy. Then, the meson-exchange and direct $J/\psi$-radiation contributions are included as part of the Born term. More specifically, we examine the contributions of the light-meson [$\pi^0(135)$, $\eta(548)$, $\eta'(958)$, $f_1(1285)$] and charmonium-meson [$\eta_c(1S)$, $\chi_{c0}(1P)$, $\chi_{c1}(1P)$, $\eta_c(2S)$, $\chi_{c1}(3872)$] exchanges in the $t$-channel diagram. Most of the coupling constants are determined from the radiative decays of the $J/\psi$ or other relevant charmonium states. Finally, we consider the $J/\psi N$ final-state interaction (FSI) within the leading-order approximation, which includes gluon-exchange and direct $J/\psi N$-coupling terms. The model parameters of the Hamiltonian are fitted to the data from the GlueX and $J/\psi$-007 experiments at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). The light mesons $\eta(548)$ and $\eta'(958)$ are found to make the most significant contributions, whereas the charmonium mesons play only a minor role. The direct $J/\psi$-radiation term begins to come into play only in the backward scattering regions. The FSI contribution is suppressed by a factor of $10^1 - 10^2$ in comparison to the Born-term contribution when a Yukawa-type potential is employed for the charmonium-nucleon interaction. Our results agree well with the available JLab data on the total and $t$-dependent differential cross sections. High-precision, angle-dependent data in the threshold region ($E_\gamma \leqslant 8.9$ GeV) are crucial for confirming the FSI effect.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry and its breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to fundamental symmetries playing a crucial role for establishing the Standard Model of fundamental interactions, approximate symmetries provide essential insight into the respective phenomena and shed light on the underlying physics. Here we give a brief pedagogical introduction to chiral symmetry as an approximate but still rather accurate symmetry of strong interactions and its spontaneous breaking in the vacuum of Quantum Chromodynamics. Special attention is paid to a microscopic picture of this phenomenon and understanding a dual nature of the chiral pion that is the Goldstone boson related to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the lowest pseudoscalar quark-antiquark state in the spectrum of hadrons simultaneously.</description>

      <title>On the contribution from the light quarks to $H\to\gamma\gamma , \gamma Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter addresses the contribution from the light $u , d , s$ quarks to the amplitudes for the decay modes of the Brout-Englert-Higgs scalar boson $H$ into two photons ($H\to\gamma\gamma$) or to a photon and a neutral weak gauge boson ($H\to\gamma Z$), taking into account the non-perturbative aspects of QCD. Contrary to a recent claim, the contribution from the light quarks does not vanish. Rather, it is shown that, in contrast to the perturbative evaluations usually considered in the literature, this contribution to the amplitudes starts with a term that is linear, and not quadratic, in the masses of the light quarks, thus pointing toward a sizeable enhancement of their contribution to $H \to \gamma \gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we summarise the recent experimental measurements and theoretical work on Higgs boson production via vector-boson fusion at the LHC. Along with this, we provide state-of-the-art predictions at fixed order as well as with parton-shower corrections within the Standard Model at 13.6 TeV. The results are presented in the form of multi-differential distributions as well as in the Simplified Template Cross Section bins. All materials and outputs of this study are available on public repositories. Finally, following findings in the literature, recommendations are made to estimate theoretical uncertainties related to parton-shower corrections.</description>

      <title>Kaon-deuteron femtoscopy from unitarized chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a theoretical study of the correlation functions of $K^- d$ and $K^+ d$ pairs and compared them with those provided by the ALICE Collaboration from Pb-Pb collisions, and also from high-multiplicity p-p collisions in the case of $K^+ d$. In addition to implementing the effect of the Coulomb force, the $K^- d$ and $K^+ d$ wave functions are derived from the corresponding strong scattering amplitudes that are built employing a unitarized chiral model for the elementary $K^- N$ and $K^+ N$ interactions. We present results for the impulse approximation, which accounts for single-scattering processes of the kaon with the nucleons of the deuteron, as well as for the solution of the Faddeev equations in the so-called fixed center approximation, which includes multiple rescattering effects. The $K^- d$ correlation function is shown to be very sensitive to both the size of the source and the relative momentum of the interacting pair, with large deviations from the Coulomb baseline and sizable multi-step scattering contributions, effects that are tied to a ${\bar K}N$ strong interaction that is dominated by the influence of the subthreshold resonance $\Lambda(1405)$. In contrast, the $K^+ d$ correlation function only differs appreciably from the Coulomb one for relatively small sources, reflecting the mildly repulsive and elastic behavior of the $KN$ strong force. The calculated correlation functions are found to nicely reproduce the experimental data of the ALICE collaboration. Our study serves to reinforce the validity of the theoretical models employed and demonstrates the value of femtoscopy as a powerful tool for probing hadronic interactions involving strangeness.</description>

      <title>All-gluon amplitudes with off-shell recursion in multiplet bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient computation of color-summed QCD amplitudes at high parton multiplicities remains a central challenge for precision collider predictions. Existing approaches using trace, color-flow, or adjoint bases suffer from non-orthogonality, which complicates the color algebra and scales poorly with multiplicity. In this work, we present an off-shell recursive framework for computing all-gluon tree-level amplitudes directly in orthogonal multiplet bases. Utilizing Wigner $6j$ coefficients, we construct an algorithm that builds multiplet-projected off-shell currents from lower-point currents. By optimizing the recursion through partial summation and caching, we find that the computational complexity of calculating $n$-gluon color-summed squared amplitudes scales as $\mathcal{O}(17^n)$. This demonstrates the potential competitiveness of multiplet bases for high-multiplicity processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study both orbital and spin contributions to quarkonia spin alignment induced by magnetic field in heavy ion collisions. The orbital contribution arises from distortion of quarkonium spatial wave function, and the spin contribution is due to spin states mixing in the magnetic field. We find the spin contribution dominates in heavy ion phenomenology. The subleading orbital contribution offers the possibility of studying structure change of quarkonium in magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and emergent symmetries in hadron scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one potential origin of emergent symmetries. In this work, we extend this theoretical framework to accommodate particles with arbitrary spins and/or arbitrary group representations. As case studies, we discuss recent efforts to test the entanglement-suppression conjecture in two hadron systems that exhibit possible emergent symmetries. The first concerns interactions involving spin-3/2 baryons, where entanglement suppression gives rise to symmetries such as $\text{SU}(40)$ spin-flavor symmetry. The second system involves low-energy scattering of heavy mesons, where entanglement suppression leads to an enhancement of the inherent heavy-quark spin symmetry to a light-quark spin symmetry, predicting additional siblings for the prominent exotic double-charm meson $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. These predictions should be confronted against experimental data and lattice results to further test the minimal-entanglement conjecture.</description>

      <title>Scaling functions in the soft-wall AdS/QCD models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static scaling behavior of the chiral condensate near the two-flavor critical point within the framework of the soft-wall AdS/QCD. The scaling functions are extracted from the chiral order parameters and are found to precisely match those obtained through mean-field calculations. Additionally, it is also checked that the scaling functions are independent of the specific construction of the holographic model. Furthermore, we develop the formalism for calculating the chiral susceptibility and demonstrate that the pseudo-critical temperatures obey the scaling law for moderate quark masses. It is shown that the temperature scaling could be comparable with those obtained from Dyson-Schwinger equations and lattice simulations. These findings could help improve the effectiveness of the soft-wall AdS/QCD.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar meson dominance, the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix elements of the pseudoscalar density with pion-quantum numbers $I^G J^{PC}= 1^- 0^{-+}$ in the nucleon in terms of dispersion relations, PCAC and pQCD asymptotic sum rules for the pseudoscalar form factor. We show that the corresponding spectral density must have at least one zero. A model based on ChPT at low energies, resonances at intermediate energies, Regge power-like behaviour at high energies and pQCD at asymptotically high energies allows to deduce the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy $\Delta_{GT} = 1 -\frac{m_N g_A}{F_{\pi}g_{\pi NN}}$ yielding the results
  \[ g_{\pi NN} = 13.14(^{+7}_{-4}), \quad \Delta_{\rm GT} = 1.26(^{+51}_{-34})\% , \] to be compared with the most precise determinations, $g_{\pi^+ np} = 13.25(5)$ (and hence $\Delta_{\rm GT}=2.1(4) \%$), from $np, pp$ scattering analysis of the Granada-2013 database. Our work supports the concept of pseudoscalar dominance in the nucleon structure suggested by Dominguez long ago. The minimal resonance saturation of the pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon with the lowest isovector-pseudoscalar mesons compatible with analyticity, pQCD short distance constraints and chiral symmetry leads to an extended PCAC in the large-$N_c$ limit, and effectively depends on the $\pi(1300)$-excited pion state. Our results are compatible, though more accurate, than recent lattice QCD studies and are consistent with almost flat strong pion-nucleon-nucleon vertices.</description>

      <title>Pionic gluons from global QCD analysis of experimental and lattice data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first global QCD analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the pion, with lattice-QCD data on gluonic pseudo--Ioffe-time distributions fitted simultaneously with experimental Drell-Yan and leading neutron electroproduction data. Inclusion of the lattice results with parametrized systematic corrections significantly reduces the uncertainties on the gluon PDF at parton momentum fractions $x \gtrsim 0.2$, revealing a higher gluon density in the pion at large $x$ than in the proton. The similar gluon momentum fractions in the pion and proton further suggests a relative suppression of the pion gluon density at small $x$.</description>

      <title>Review of the Higgs boson production via vector boson fusion and its decay into bottom quarks in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8,13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive overview of the vector boson fusion production and the following decay of the Higgs boson to two bottom quarks (\(H\!\to\! b\bar{b}\)), which dominates the Higgs total width yet remains experimentally challenging because of substantial QCD multijet backgrounds. We overview the use of boosted decision trees, which advance jet reconstruction and flavour tagging by including boosted topologies and deep-learning-based \(b\)-tagging and which improve sensitivity in associated production channels. Special attention is given to ATLAS and CMS selections and results pertaining to the vector boson fusion production of Higgs, decaying in the $b\bar{b}$-channel, from both the 8 TeV and the 13 TeV LHC data-sets conducted with up to 90.8 $fb^{-1}$ of Data and published through 2024. Consistent with the Standard Model gauge symmetry \(SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\) predictions, we emphasise how \(H\!\to\! b\bar{b}\) measurements contribute, in conjunction with other production modes and decay channels, to tests of the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling, which is an essential probe of the electroweak symmetry-breaking mechanism. Finally, we discuss how the current precision constrains deviations in the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling, outline ongoing efforts during Run 3, and consider the prospects of forthcoming high-luminosity LHC operation and the proposed Future Circular Collider in further tightening precision tests of the Standard Model and beyond.</description>

      <title>The $1/N_c$ Operator Analysis of the Combined Octet and Decuplet Baryons Contact Interactions in SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the non-derivative four-point interactions for Octet and Decuplet baryons in the SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChEFT) framework and there are {black}{104} terms. The non-relativistic expansion of the baryon fields has been considered up to the {Next-to-Leading Order} (NLO) of the three-momentum. We find 28 and 106 Low-Energy Constants (LECs) for {Leading Order} (LO) and NLO, respectively. Using the Hartree Hamiltonian of the $1/N_c$ expansion of the operator product up to {Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order} (NNLO), we can reduce the free parameters (coupling constants) of the ChEFT from 104 down to 53 up to NLO of the three-momentum expansion. Moreover, we will discuss the implications of the large-$N_c$ sum rules in $\Omega\Omega$ and $\Omega N$ scatterings where the future results from lattice QCD can be used to test our sum rules.</description>

Abstract: We present the first next-to-leading order matched and multi-jet merged predictions based on the Alaric parton shower. The components needed for infrared subtraction in the S-MC@NLO algorithm are computed analytically for the case of color singlet decays to hadronic final states and validated against existing approaches for up to e+e- to 5 jets. Phenomenological results for e+e- to hadrons at the Z pole are obtained with up to five jets at next-to-leading order precision, for the first time using an evolution algorithm with NLL-preserving kinematics mapping.</description>

      <title>From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provides a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15458v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extraction of Compton Form Factors (CFFs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) experiments conducted at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, utilizing Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). The analysis employs the standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and M\"uller formalism at twist-two, complemented by a fitting procedure designed to minimize model dependence in a manner analogous to conventional local fits. A pseudodata extraction test of the CFFs is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and QDNNs, with a detailed comparative analysis. Results indicate that QDNNs can outperform CDNNs in particular cases, offering enhanced predictive accuracy and precision even with limited model complexity. Motivated by this, we develop a metric to quantify the extent of the quantum advantage based on characteristics of DVCS experimental data. These findings underscore the promising role of QDNNs in advancing future investigations into multidimensional parton distributions and hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>Two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ decay to excited states at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-neutrino double-beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) into first-excited $0^+_2$ states of nuclei used in $\beta\beta$ decay experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe. We calculate the corresponding nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) within the nuclear shell model, using various Hamiltonians that describe well the spectroscopy of the initial and final nuclei. We evaluate the next-to-leading order (NLO) long-range NMEs recently introduced within chiral effective field theory, keeping three terms in the expansion of the energy denominator. In most cases, NLO contributions to the half-life are below 5%, but they can increase to 25% due to cancellations in the leading-order Gamow-Teller NME. A detailed analysis in terms of nuclear deformation, including triaxiality, indicates that larger deformation differences between the initial and final states generally lead to smaller NMEs, but the seniority structure of the states also plays a relevant role. The lower range of our predicted half-lives, with uncertainties dominated by the nuclear Hamiltonian used, are slightly longer than the current experimental limit in $^{76}$Ge and the very recent half-life indication in $^{82}$Se.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 43\%, 31\%, and 4\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully self-consistent computation of the graviton spectral function in quantum gravity, using the spectral renormalisation group for gravity put forward in arXiv:2111.13232v2 [hep-th] within a physical mass-shell renormalisation scheme. Here, self-consistency refers to the fact that the full non-perturbative spectral function is used in the diagrams, including the scattering continuum. We find a positive graviton spectral function with a massless one-graviton peak and a multi-graviton continuum with a close-to-quadratic spectral decay in the ultraviolet. Within the physical on-shell renormalisation scheme, the graviton satisfies the sum rule of an asymptotic state and features a unit total spectral weight. We briefly discuss the implications of the physical formulation for the computation of scattering processes and investigations of unitarity in asymptotically safe quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Low-energy multi-photon scattering at tree-level and one-loop order in a homogeneous electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study low energy photons coupled to scalar and spinor matter in the presence of an arbitrary homogeneous electromagnetic field in a first-quantised (worldline) approach. Utilising a Fock-Schwinger gauge for both the scattering photons and homogeneous background, simple compact expressions are found for both the photon- and background-dressed effective action and propagator in scalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy limit allows identification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective homogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following from application of a suitable linearisation operator.
  To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a functional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green functions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a matrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a replacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop order can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy limit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum space matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for this path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and momentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in momentum space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological properties of a quantum mechanical system with $U(1)$-symmetry within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach. These properties include the vacuum energy structure and the topological susceptibility. Our approach works with a complexification of the flow equation, and specifically we embed the original symmetry into the complex plane, $U(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. We compute the effective potential of a given topological sector by restricting ourselves to field configurations with a given generalised non-trivial Chern-Simons numbers. The full potential is directly constructed from these sector potentials. Our results compare well with the benchmark results obtained from solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed in Ref. [1]. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF. It reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation, which enables us to apply the peak theory to estimate the PBH function.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions and critical exponents for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model at five loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We renormalize the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with an $O(N)$ symmetry to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^5)$ in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions and determine the anomalous dimensions of the fermion and scalar fields, $\beta$-functions as well as the scalar field's mass operator. These are used to construct several $N$ dependent critical exponents relevant for quantum transitions in semi-metals and in particular those connected with graphene in three dimensions when $N=2$. Improved exponent estimates for scalar fermion transitions on a honeycomb lattice, when $N=1$, as well as for $N=5$ are also given to compare with results from other techniques such as the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>The influence of electromagnetic fields on the generation of the directed and elliptic flows of heavy quark in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of self-generated electromagnetic fields (EMF) on the charm quarks momentum evolution in the partonic and hadronic medium created in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energy within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) off-shell transport approach. In the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase, the charm quark interacts with the off-shell partons whose mass and widths are given by the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM), which can reproduce the lattice QCD thermodynamics. The background electromagnetic fields are computed dynamically within the PHSD considering both the spectators and participants protons as well as newly produced charged hadrons, quarks, and antiquarks, which reflects naturally the electric conductivity $\sigma_{el}$ of the medium. We study the directed and elliptic flow of the $D$ mesons in the presence of the electromagnetic fields. We find that electromagnetically induced splitting in the $D$ meson $v_1$ through $D^0$ and $\overline{D}^0$ mesons is consistent with the experimental data. Furthermore, we notice that the splitting in the heavy quark $v_1$ as a function of $p_T$ is more prominent as a probe of the produced electromagnetic fields. However, we find only a small impact of electromagnetic fields on the heavy quark elliptic flow $v_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves on small scales are not tightly constrained by current cosmological observations, which allows for the possibility of large amplitudes at small scales. We investigate second-order tensor induced gravitational waves (TIGWs) sourced by primordial gravitational waves and present the corresponding corrections to the total energy density spectrum of gravitational wave. We analyze primordial gravitational waves with large amplitudes generated by various models at small scales. Our results indicate that when primordial gravitational waves on small scales sufficiently dominate the current PTA observations, corrections to the total energy density spectrum from second-order TIGWs may become pronounced in certain frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Gauge Choices, Infrared Pitfalls, and Thermal Effects in Effective Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of effective potentials is critical for a range of phenomenological applications, including inflation, vacuum stability, and phase transitions. A drawback arises from the gauge-dependence of the effective potential. Furthermore, in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the effective potential exhibits infrared (IR) divergences in the limit of vanishing Goldstone masses. By considering the multiplicative anomaly that arises due to non-factorisation of elliptic operators in the Fermi gauge when computing the effective potential at one-loop order, we demonstrate that its gauge independence and IR behaviour are improved to the corresponding findings of Landau gauge calculations simultaneously. The latter are straightforwardly and transparently reproduced using an approach that employs the Heat Kernel technique, thereby providing a shortcut to reflect anomaly-related cancellations from the outset. Our findings generalise to the treatment of the effective potential at finite temperature. In particular, the Heat Kernel extends gauge independence to any value of the expansion in mass over temperature.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal contributions to $Z\gamma V^\ast$ vertex, polarizations and bounds on $Z\overline{t}q$ couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the flavor-changing neutral current contributions to the trilinear neutral gauge boson couplings $Z\gamma V^\ast$ ($V=Z$, $\gamma$) at the one-loop level. Only the $CP$-conserving form factor $h_3^Z$ is induced, with the relevant contributions arising from top quark couplings. To our numerical analysis, constraints on the $Z\overline{t}q$ ($q=c$, $u$) couplings are obtained from current LHC data, leading to bounds of $|g_{\text{V}}^{tu}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tu}|\leqslant 0.007$ and $|g_{\text{V}}^{tc}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tc}|\leqslant 0.0095$ for the vector and axial couplings. The new contributions to the $h_3^Z$ form factor are of order $10^{-7}$. Furthermore, we analyze the polarized partial decay widths of the $V^\ast\rightarrow Z\gamma$ process, and a new type of left-right asymmetry is also discussed. We find that in the presence of new physics, the polarized $\Gamma(V^\ast\rightarrow Z\gamma)$ exhibits significant deviations from the SM prediction, resulting in a non-zero asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Properties of neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars from a pion mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the static neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars, based on the equations of state derived from a pion mean-field approach. Using the empirical data on the pion-nucleus scattering and bulk properties of nuclear matter, we have already fixed all the parameters in a previous work, where the nucleons and hyperons were shown to be modified in various nuclear medium. In the current work, we first examine the energy and pressure inside a neutron star. We show that the central densities in various neutron stars vary within the range of $(3-4)\rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the normal nuclear matter density. The mass-radius relations are obtained and discussed. As the slope parameter for neutron matter increases, the radii of the neutron stars increase with their masses fixed. We also study the strangeness-mixed stars or the hyperon stars using the same sets of the parameters. As the strangeness content of strange matter increases, the binding energy per nucleon is saturated and the corresponding equation of state becomes softened. Consequently, the central densities of the strangeness-mixed stars increase. Assuming that recently observed neutron stars are the strangeness-mixed ones, we find that the central densities increase.</description>

      <title>Observability of 2HDM charged Higgs boson in a misaligned scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large hadron collider precision measurement of $h_{125}$ properties suggests that a misaligned two Higgs doublet model type 1 is preferred among other types of the model. In this analysis, a lepton collider potential for charged Higgs boson observation is evaluated and compared with HL-LHC expectations. We focus on $H^{\pm} \to W^{\pm}h_{125}$ decay which is exclusively activated in misalignment scenario. An event analysis including fast detector simulation is performed and it is shown that some parts of the parameter space which are out of HL-LHC reach can be probed by a high energy lepton collider with signal significance exceeding $2\sigma$ and $5\sigma$ for exclusion or discovery. The region with highest sensitivity is in the middle range charged Higgs boson mass, i.e., $350 &lt; m_{H^{\pm}} &lt;450$ GeV and $\tan \beta \gtrsim4$ at non-zero $\cos(\beta-\alpha)$ values.</description>

      <title>Optimal sensitivity of anomalous charged triple gauge couplings through $W$ boson helicity at the $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the estimation of anomalous charged triple gauge couplings (cTGCs) parameterized in a model-independent Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) framework via $WW$ production followed by semi-leptonic decay at the $e^+e^-$ colliders. The anomalous $(WWV~(V=\gamma,Z))$ couplings are given in terms of Wilson coefficients of three CP-conserving and two CP-violating dimension-6 operators in the HISZ basis. We adopt the optimal observable technique (OOT) to extract the sensitivity of these anomalous couplings and compare it with the latest experimental limits on anomalous couplings studied at the LHC. The limits on the anomalous couplings obtained via OOT are significantly tighter than the ones obtained using standard $\chi^2$ analysis. The impact of different helicity combinations of the $W$ boson pair in determining optimal sensitivity is analyzed. The constraints on CP-violating operators from the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon colliders provide an exciting new direction to expand the energy frontier of particle physics. We point out a new use of these facilities for neutrino and beyond the Standard Model physics using their main detectors. Muon decays along the accelerator rings create an intense and highly collimated neutrino beam that crosses a thin slice of the kt-scale detector. As a result, it would induce an unprecedented number of neutrino interactions, with $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ events per second for a 10 TeV $\mu^+\mu^-$ collider. These interactions are highly energetic and possess a distinct timing signature and a large transverse displacement. We discuss promising applications of these events for instrumentation, electroweak, and beyond-the-Standard Model physics. For instance, a sub-percent measurement of the neutrino-electron scattering rate enables new precision measurements of the Weak angle and a novel detection of the neutrino charge radius.</description>

      <title>LHC-friendly freeze-in dark matter via Higgs portal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves footprints in dark matter direct detection and collider experiments. This situation can be altered in two-field context. In this work we propose a two-field freeze-in dark matter model through Higgs portal. The observed dark matter relic abundance is obtained by a decay of scalar mediator thermalized in the early Universe. While there is a lack of direct dark matter signals, the scalar mediator is in the reach of HL-LHC either through vector boson fusion or Mono-Z channel. Within allowed scalar mass window of 10-50 GeV, we use improved cuts to derive both $2\sigma$ exclusion and $5\sigma$ discovery limits, depending on the value of Higgs portal coupling. If verified, this scalar mediator signal allows us to infer the freeze-in dark matter.</description>

      <title>Searching for single production of vector-like quarks decaying into $Wb$ at a future muon-proton collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the discovery potential for singly-produced Vector-Like Quarks~(VLQs) $T$ ($Q=+2/3e$) and $Y$ ($Q=-4/3e$) decaying to $Wb$ at future $\mu p$ colliders with $\sqrt{s}=5.29$, 6.48, and 9.16 TeV, analyzing both leptonic and hadronic $W$ decay channels through detailed detector simulations. The hadronic channel demonstrates superior sensitivity, enabling $5\sigma$ discovery up to $m_T=3750$ GeV ($m_Y=4100$ GeV) at 9.16 TeV with 100 fb$^{-1}$, while exclusion limits reach $m_T=4500$ GeV ($g^*\geq0.06$) and $m_Y=4800$ GeV ($\kappa_Y\geq0.04$) - significantly beyond LHC capabilities. At 5.29 TeV, discovery regions cover $g^*\in[0.15,0.5]$ for $m_T\in[1500,2520]$ GeV and $\kappa_Y\in[0.12,0.5]$ for $m_Y\in[1700,2700]$ GeV, with exclusions extending to $m_T=2750$ GeV and $m_Y=3020$ GeV. These results, obtained within a simplified two-parameter framework ($m_{T/Y}$ and electroweak couplings $g^{\ast}$), establish $\mu p$ colliders as uniquely powerful tools for probing high-mass VLQ states, particularly in the boosted jet regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we have considered two minimal versions of scotogenic models, where neutrinos acquire masses through a radiative mechanism. We call these two models as Majorana and Dirac scotogenic models. In the former model, neutrinos have Majorana nature, and in the later one, neutrinos are Dirac particles. These two models are related to each other in terms of additional fields and symmetries of the model. Hence, to compare these two models in future experiments, we have analyzed lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes in both of them, in the charged lepton sector. We have found that the 3-body LFV decays in both these models can get different contributions. Among all the LFV decays and after satisfying relevant constraints, we have found that $\tau\to3\mu$ can have a branching ratio as high as $10^{-10}(10^{-11})$ in the Majorana(Dirac) scotogenic model.</description>

      <title>Z boson production in proton-lead collisions: A study utilizing MRW nuclear TMDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the production of Z bosons in proton-lead collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8.16$ TeV, utilizing various transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs), including the leading order Martin-Ryskin-Watt (LO-MRW), next-to-leading order MRW (NLO-MRW), and parton branching (PB) approaches. By comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data from the CMS collaboration, we assess the performance of these TMD models across different kinematic regions. Our analysis reveals that while both LO-MRW and NLO-MRW models generally align well with experimental data, the LO-MRW model tends to overestimate in certain kinematic regions. The NLO-MRW model, with its strong ordering constraint, provides better agreement in these areas. This study highlights the impact of different impositions of angular and strong ordering constraints in the LO-MRW and NLO-MRW approaches in describing Z boson production.</description>

      <title>Super heavy dark matter origin of the PeV neutrino event: KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this \textit{letter}, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal scenario where the SHDM decays to neutrino and SM Higgs. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass, ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits, and the observed KM3-230213A event, along with the gamma-ray constraints. We find that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on the DM mass ranging from $1.5\times10^8$ GeV to $5.2\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime in the range: $1.42\times10^{30}$ s to $5.4\times10^{29}$ s. Remarkably, in our SHDM scenario, the apparent tension between the KM3NeT observation and the non-observation of this event by IceCube and Auger can be reduced to below $1.2\sigma$. Our results are applicable to any neutrinophilic SHDM models while evading gamma-ray constraints.</description>

      <title>Oscillating scalar potential and its implications for cosmic neutrino background searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism in which an external oscillatory wave modulates the mass-squared term of a scalar potential, periodically switching its sign. As a result of this "potential oscillation," the vacuum transitions between symmetry-broken and symmetry-restored phases. This repeated toggling leads to a time-varying vacuum state with rich phenomenological consequences, driven by the scalar field's couplings to other sectors. As a concrete illustration, we demonstrate how these oscillations can open a new avenue for probing the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <title>Towards automatizing Higgs decays in BSM models at one-loop in the decoupling renormalization scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the use of a decoupling renormalization scheme in the calculation of NLO corrections to SM-like Higgs boson decays in the beyond the Standard Model models. The advantage of this particular scheme is its decoupling property in the presence of a heavy BSM physics and the possibility to directly include known higher-order Standard Model corrections. We illustrate the use of this scheme by analysing the $h \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay in a simple Standard Model extension by an $S_1$ leptoquark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged-current deep inelastic scattering plays a significant role in determining parton distribution functions with flavour separation.In this work, we present a systematic calculation of the charged-current semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in the $eN$ collinear frame up to twist-3 level at leading order. Semi-inclusive refers to the process in which a jet is detected in addition to the scattered neutrino. We focus on neutrino-jet correlations in our calculation. We first present the differential cross section in terms of structure functions, followed by the differential cross section expressed in term of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions. We derive the complete set of azimuthal asymmetries and intrinsic asymmetries. We also introduce an observable $A^C$, defined as the ratio of the difference to the sum of differential cross sections for electron and positron semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering.We notice that $A^C$ provides a sensitive probe for valence and sea quark distribution functions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the particles being searched for at the LHC beyond the Standard Model are bileptons, which are doubly charged gauge bosons. Bileptons are predicted by several Standard Model extensions, including the so-called 331 models with $\beta = \sqrt 3$. The minimal formulation of these models is generally plagued by a "low energy" Landau pole, which can undermine current predictions for TeV-scale bileptons. We analyze this issue and investigate the possibility to shift the Landau pole at higher energy scales by extending the troublesome minimal 331 models.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (HB$\chi$PT), a non-relativistic effective field theory that treats baryons as heavy static sources, to calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of spin-3/2 baryons in two sectors: the light-flavor decuplet baryons and singly heavy sextet baryons. We derive the analytical expressions up to $\mathcal{O}\left(p^3\right)$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections provide substantial contributions to the polarizabilities. In addition, magnetic dipole (M1) transitions of the baryons can significantly affect the magnetic polarizabilities and may even reverse their signs. For the decuplet baryons, the $\Delta^+$ and $\Delta^0$ exhibit the largest electric polarizabilities. Their values, $\alpha_E(\Delta^+) = (17.5 \pm 9.5)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(\Delta^0) = (17.0 \pm 9.3)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$, significantly exceed those typically observed for nucleons. Meanwhile, the electric polarizabilities of spin-3/2 singly heavy baryons are comparable to those of their spin-1/2 partners.</description>

      <title>Analyzing $t\bar{t}Z$-couplings at the future $e^-p$ collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposed Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), with center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}\approx 1.3$ TeV, provides a clean and sensitive environment to probe the top quark's neutral current interactions with the $Z$ boson via the process $e^- p \to e^- t \bar{t}$. We investigate the precision with which the Standard Model (SM) $t\bar{t}Z$ couplings-the vector and axial-vector components ($\Delta C_{1V}$, $\Delta C_{1A}$)-can be measured, along with possible new physics effects parameterized by higher-dimensional operators inducing weak electric and magnetic dipole-like interactions ($C_{2V}$, $C_{2A}$). Focusing on the semileptonic decay channel, where either the top quark or anti-top decays leptonically to a positively charged lepton ($\ell^+ = e^+, \mu^+$), we utilize the azimuthal angle difference $\Delta \phi$ between the scattered electron and the charged lepton as the key observable. Using a one-parameter multi-bin $\chi^2$-analysis of this differential distribution, we find that constraints on $\Delta C_{1V}$ and $\Delta C_{1A}$ improve from order $10^{-1}$ at 50 fb$^{-1}$ to order $10^{-2}$ at 1000 fb$^{-1}$, corresponding to approximately 50% and 6% precision relative to their SM values. The anomalous tensor couplings $C_{2V}$ and $C_{2A}$ are constrained at the $10^{-1}$ level even at low luminosity and improve moderately with high luminosity. While the two-parameter analysis broadens the allowed regions due to parameter correlations, it retains competitive sensitivity, particularly for SM-like couplings. A systematic uncertainty of 5% is assumed throughout. These results highlight the LHeC's potential to provide complementary and competitive sensitivity to top-$Z$ couplings compared to current and future hadron and lepton collider capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with explicit CP violation offers a promising framework for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry while remaining consistent with stringent electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked set of two-loop diagrams that contribute to fermion EDMs in the NMSSM. Our analysis of the electron EDM shows that, for certain NMSSM specific CP-violating phases, these diagrams partially cancel existing contributions, thereby relaxing the associated constraints. In other phases, the diagrams dominate and tighten the bounds, which in turn necessitates more finely tuned parameters to reconcile successful baryogenesis with current EDM limits.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Study on Gauge Symmetry of Electroweak Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroweak (EW) amplitudes in the gauge-Goldstone 5-component formalism have a distinctive property: gauge symmetry is imprinted in the amplitudes, manifested as the massive Ward identity (MWI) $k^M\mathcal M_M=0$. In this paper, we use the HELAS package to numerically study gauge symmetry in EW amplitudes. First, we directly test gauge symmetry by examining the MWI of amplitudes. Second, we modify the couplings within a vertex and of vertices to check if and how the MWI changes. Third, we test gauge symmetry by considering the couplings modified by operators from the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT). Similar to the standard model, there are relations between different couplings that are protected by gauge symmetry. We find that if we modify the couplings to deviate from the relations, the MWI is violated. On the other hand, the MWI is restored when the relations between couplings reduce to those in the SMEFT.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces\,: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains\,: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (81\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice result $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM} = (87\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP contributions in adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions to the ones in Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $ and $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the KM3-230213A PeV Neutrino Event via Vector Dark Matter Decay and Its Multi-Messenger Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A with a reconstructed energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}$ PeV, the most energetic astrophysical neutrino ever detected. The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes. We present a vector dark matter model based on a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry to interpret this event through superheavy dark matter decay. Our analysis demonstrates that dark matter lifetimes in the range $7.3 \times 10^{28}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{30}$ s can successfully account for the KM3-230213A event while satisfying stringent constraints from gamma-ray observations. Moreover, the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_X$ in our model naturally predicts cosmic string formation, generating a stochastic gravitational wave background with string tension $4.5 \times 10^{-11} \lesssim G\mu \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$, consistent with recent pulsar timing array observations. This multi-messenger consistency across neutrinos, gamma-rays, and gravitational waves validates our vector dark matter interpretation of the KM3-230213A event while providing testable predictions for upcoming multi-wavelength experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new jet observable, the one-point energy correlators (EC), designed to characterize the in-jet energy flow distribution by measuring energy deposition at a specific angle relative to the jet axis. Building upon the transverse momentum dependent physics, we aim for the EC to provide novel insights into jet substructure and offer a new approach to study TMD physics, particularly gluon transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions (TMDFFs) which are notoriously difficult to extract. We obtain the factorization of the EC jet function within Soft-Collinear Effective Theory and leverage the framework of semi-inclusive TMD fragmenting jet functions. We resum large global logarithms and non-global logarithms (NGLs) and show that the normalized EC jet function exhibits significantly reduced dependence on the factorization scale and is primarily sensitive to the jet scale. Finally, after incorporating non-perturbative effects, we present numerical calculations up to NNLL accuracy for global logarithms and LL accuracy for NGLs, and we compare these predictions with PYTHIA 8 simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm exotic mesons based on a coupled-channel framework, where the physical states are described as superpositions of a compact $c\bar c$ core (identified with the $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ states) and hadronic components such as $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$. We incorporate meson exchange potentials to describe hadron-hadron interactions and determine model parameters to reproduce the observed masses of $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$. The model also predicts a $0^{++}$ bound state consistent with the $X(3860)$. The internal structure is found to be predominantly molecular for the $X(3872)$, while the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$ have larger $c\bar{c}$ components. The coupling between $c\bar{c}$ cores and hadronic components plays a crucial role in generating these states. The resulting wave functions provide insight into the internal structure and decay properties of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Shapes of magnetic monopoles in effective $SU(2)$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic exploration of a general family of effective $SU(2)$ models with an adjoint scalar. First, we discuss a redundancy in this class of models and use it to identify seemingly different, yet physically equivalent models. Next, we construct the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit and derive analytic monopole solutions. In contrast to the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, included here as a special case, these solutions tend to exhibit more complex energy density profiles. Typically, we obtain monopoles with a hollow cavity at their core where virtually no energy is concentrated; accordingly, most of the monopole's energy is stored in a spherical shell around its core. Moreover, the shell itself can be structured, with several "sub-shells". A recipe for the construction of these analytic solutions is presented.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Black Holes as Sources of High-Energy Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, the idea that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly relevant for systems with a large information storage capacity, such as black holes. In these objects, the evaporation process halts, at the latest, once approximately half of the initial mass has been radiated away. As a result, light primordial black holes (PBHs) with mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{g}$, which are traditionally assumed to have fully evaporated by the present time, may instead survive and constitute viable dark matter candidates. Ongoing mergers of such PBHs would give rise to ``young'' black holes that resume their evaporation, emitting ultrahigh-energy particles potentially detectable by current experiments. The resulting emission spectrum would be thermal across all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinctive signature. We demonstrate that, if the memory burden effect activates after PBHs have lost around half of their initial mass, current measurements of the neutrino flux at Earth place strong constraints on such dark matter candidates for $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$. This suggests that the memory burden must set in at earlier stages of evaporation. Unlike existing bounds, our results depend solely on the mass of the remnant, and not on model-dependent details of the stabilized phase. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through observations of gamma rays, cosmic rays, and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06349</link>

Abstract: We develop a method to compute the pion transition form factor directly at arbitrary space-like photon momenta and use it to determine the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The calculation is performed using eight gauge ensembles generated with 2+1 flavor domain wall fermions, incorporating multiple pion masses, lattice spacings, and volumes. By introducing a pion structure function and performing a Gegenbauer expansion, we demonstrate that about 98\% of the $\pi^0$-pole contribution can be extracted in a model-independent manner, thereby ensuring that systematic effects are well controlled. After applying finite-volume corrections, as well as performing chiral and continuum extrapolations, we obtain the final result for the $\pi^0$-pole contribution to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\mu}^{\pi^0\mathrm{-pole}}=61.2(1.7)\times 10^{-11}$, and the $\pi^0$ decay width, $\Gamma_{\pi^0\to \gamma\gamma}=7.60(27)$ eV.</description>

      <title>First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Gravity in Gravitational Wave Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms on the gravitational wave memory effect. In certain quantum gravity theories and semi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects) exhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger waveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the detector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features following the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect signatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black holes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform templates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In this work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory arising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar ${\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features is model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real interferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is estimated subsequently. We further compute the physical fluxes associated to the echo at both the black hole horizon and null infinity and identify novel distinguishing features of the underlying reflectivity models in measurement data.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena have been predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, more recently, quantum particle teleportation.
  Here, we introduce the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We illustrate the idea within a 1+1D toy model of particle-antiparticle creation and space-time evolution obeying transport locality. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to observe apparent teleportation driven by strong interactions through measurements of correlations between the momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in nuclear collisions. Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of deep-inelastic $e+p$ scattering data from HERA and transverse energy distributions in $p+p$ and $p+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions, alongside charged hadron multiplicities in $\mathrm{Pb}+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02\;\mathrm{TeV}$ from ALICE. Using a saturation-based initial state model grounded in high-energy QCD, we determine the early-time non-equilibrium shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ of the quark-gluon plasma. Our results provide new insights into the early-time transport properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new look onto the thermodynamics of cold isospin QCD matter described within the quarkyonic framework, when confining forces are essential only for the momentum states close to the Fermi sphere and lead to formation of the quark-antiquark correlations with quantum numbers of pions. Within this picture cold isospin QCD matter is constituted by the Bose-Einstein condensate of pions and free (anti)quarks. We develop a simple confining model of pions existing as the lowest energy $P$-state of in-medium three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and use it to show that under the conditions of isospin QCD quarkyonic matter can onset at densities significantly smaller than the overlap density of pions. Using the experimentally established pion charge radius we demonstrate that the onset density can be even lower than two nuclear saturation densities. To analyze the lattice QCD data we develop a field-theory inspired model of quark-antiquark-pion matter with vector-isovector repulsion among pions and (anti)quarks. The quark substructure of pions, which is one of the key elements of the model, is accounted for within the one-loop no-sea approximation and leads to an effective medium dependence of the pion mass. The latter is shown to be crucial for providing asymptotic vanishing of the pion density and pion condensate, which reflects pion dissociation due to asymptotic freedom of QCD. The proposed quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD agrees with the results of perturbative calculations on reaching the conformal limit of QCD and with the data of lattice simulations, which supports its viability and physical relevance.</description>

      <title>On internal mechanical properties of Electroweak Magnetic Monopoles and their effects on stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering properties of the energy-momentum tensor of the electroweak magnetic monopole and its Born-Infeld extension, we attempt to make comments on the stability of these configurations. Specifically, we perform a study of the behaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended field-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum tensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion for stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and applied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic monopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole, we also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite) internal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards the centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical criterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as is the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the short-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part, due to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast, the total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both radial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to rotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the CM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or hypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated over space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld case. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM monopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it does not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the latest Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $\chi$-extended $R^2$ inflation model--can naturally accommodate a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, both of which are consistent with the latest P-ACT constraints. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum, which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The deviation of the $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$ from the single field $R^2$ inflation is related to the non-minimal coupling constant $\xi$. The consequent enhancement in the primordial power spectrum can be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$ as dark matter candidates. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs. We stress its strong connection to the seesaw mechanism for the generation of the observed small masses.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</description>

      <title>Single-flavor heavy baryons in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of single-flavor heavy baryons, $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ and $\Omega_{\rm bbb}$, in a strong magnetic field. For that sake, we simply treat the baryons as quark-diquark two-body systems, and a systematic formalism is developed to deal with two-body Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equations in a magnetic field. It is found that: 1. The orbital properties of $\Omega_{\rm bbb}$ are almost not affected by the magnetic field. 2. $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ is more tightly bound in the presence of a magnetic field. 3. The magnetic-spin effect dominates over the magnetic-orbital effect. Applying to peripheral heavy ion collisions, $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ is much better than $\Omega_{\rm bbb}$ to explore the magnetic effect, and the discovery of $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ could be more promising.</description>
