      <title>Giant Second-Order Susceptibility in Monolayer WSe2 via Strain Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer WSe$_2$ (ML WSe$_2$) exhibits high second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency under single 1-photon (1-p) or 2-photon (2-p) resonance conditions due to enhanced second-order susceptibility compared with the off-resonance state \cite{lin2021narrow,wang2015giant}. Here, we propose a novel strain engineering approach to dramatically boost the in-plane second-order susceptibility ($\chi_{yyy}$) by tuning the biaxial strain to shift two K-valley excitons (the A-exciton and a high-lying exciton (HX)) into double resonance. We first identify the A-exciton and HX from the 2D Mott-Wannier model and compare the enhanced $\chi_{yyy}$ at single 1-p and 2-p resonance states. The strongest enhancement arises from the 2-p resonance state of HX. By applying a small uniform biaxial strain (0.16%), we observe an excitonic double resonance state ($E_{\rm{HX}}$ = 2$E_{\rm{A}}$, $E_{\rm{HX}}$ and $E_{\rm{A}}$ are the exciton absorption energies). Strain-tuning can yield up to a $50$X enhancement in $\chi_{yyy}$ compared to the single 2-p resonance state of HX, resulting in a further three orders of magnitude enhancement in SHG efficiency. Further exploration of strain states near 0.16\% reveals double resonance also occurs at other wavevectors near the K valley, leading to a further increase in $\chi_{yyy}$, confirming that strain engineering is an effective methodology for enhancing $\chi_{yyy}$. Our findings suggest new avenues for strain engineering the optical properties of 2D materials for novel nonlinear optoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide design is crucial in developing efficient light delivery systems, requiring meticulous material selection, precise manufacturing, and rigorous performance optimization, including dispersion engineering. Here, we introduce universal diffractive waveguide designs that can match the performance of any conventional dielectric waveguide and achieve various functionalities. Optimized using deep learning, our diffractive waveguide designs can be cascaded to each other to form any desired length and are comprised of transmissive diffractive surfaces that permit the propagation of desired guided modes with low loss and high mode purity. In addition to guiding the targeted modes along the propagation direction through cascaded diffractive units, we also developed various waveguide components and introduced bent diffractive waveguides, rotating the direction of mode propagation, as well as programmable mode filtering and mode splitting diffractive waveguide designs, showcasing the versatility of this platform. This diffractive waveguide framework was experimentally validated in the terahertz (THz) spectrum using 3D-printed diffractive layers to selectively pass certain spatial modes while rejecting others. Diffractive waveguides can be scaled to operate at different wavelengths, including visible and infrared parts of the spectrum, without the need for material dispersion engineering, providing an alternative to traditional waveguide components. This advancement will have potential applications in telecommunications, imaging, sensing and spectroscopy, among others.</description>

      <title>A new direct method of continuous unwrapping phase from a single interferogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method recovers the phase difference of interfering wavefronts from a pattern of interference fringes, avoiding the phase discontinuity problem. The method relies on the numerical solution of one-dimensional first-order ordinary differential equations. The solution of each equation allows to compute a corresponding cross section of the two-dimensional phase, leading to the effective recovery of the phase surface. The unwrapping procedure can be performed in each orthogonal direction.</description>

      <title>Response of a multi-wavelength laser to single-sideband optical injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-mode semiconductor lasers subject to optical injection have been shown to trigger a wide range of dynamical behavior from injection locking to chaos. Multi-wavelength lasers add even more degrees of freedom and complexity to the dynamical repertoire potentially unlocking new functionalities for applications ranging from THz generation and processing to all-optical memories. In particular, leveraging the inherent mode coupling in multi-wavelength lasers, spectral multiplication over a THz range of an injected optical signal has been shown. While most of the research on optical injection has been focused on single-mode semiconductor lasers, the dynamical behavior of multi-wavelength lasers, particularly when subjected to injection of amplitude-modulated signals remains vastly unexplored. In this work, we numerically and experimentally investigate the response of an on-chip dual-wavelength laser subject to the optical injection of a single-sideband signal around one of the modes of the laser. Our findings show an asymmetric power evolution of the sidebands appearing around both the injected and un-injected modes with respect to the modulation frequency. The power and bandwidth of the sideband signals strongly depend on the resonance frequency produced by the interference between the cavity mode and the injection, which can be tailored by twerking the strength and the detuning of the injection. The outcomes of our numerical investigations, based on rate equations, align closely with the experimental results highlighting the influence of key injection and laser parameters.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral near infrared imaging using a tunable spectral phasor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging captures both spectral and spatial information from a sample. The near infrared (NIR, &gt; 800 nm) is advantageous for biomedical imaging as it falls into the tissue transparency window but also contains vibrational overtone and combination modes useful for molecular fingerprinting. Here, we demonstrate hyperspectral NIR imaging using a spectral phasor transformation (HyperNIR). This method employs a liquid crystal variable retarder (LCVR) for tunable, wavelength-dependent sine-, cosine and no filtering that transforms optical signals into phasor space. Spectral information is thus obtained with just three images. The LCVR can be adjusted to cover a spectral range from 900 nm to 1600 nm in windows tunable from 50 nm to 700 nm. This approach enables distinguishing NIR fluorophores with emission peaks less than 5 nm apart. Furthermore, we demonstrate label-free hyperspectral NIR reflectance imaging to identify plastic polymers and to monitor in vivo plant health. The approach uses the full camera resolution and reaches hyperspectral frame rates of 0.2 per second, limited only by the switching rate of the LCVR. HyperNIR facilitates straightforward hyperspectral imaging with standard NIR cameras for applications in biomedical imaging and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Statistical Localization of Electromagnetic Signals in Disordered Time-Varying Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the statistical properties of electromagnetic signals after different times of duration within one-dimensional local-disordered time-varying cavities, where both spatial and temporal disorders are added. Our findings reveal that, in the vast majority of cases, adequate temporal disorder in local space can make the electromagnetic field statistically localized, obeying a normal distribution at a specific point in time of arbitrary location within the cavity. We employ the concept of disordered space-time crystals and leverage Lindeberg's and Lyapunov's theorems to theoretically prove the normal distribution of the field values. Furthermore, we find that with the increase of energy provided by time variation, the probability of extreme fields will significantly increase and the field intensity eventually is de-normalized, that is, deviating from the normal distribution. This study not only sheds light on the statistical properties of transient signals in local-disordered time-varying systems but also paves the way for further exploration in wave dynamics of analogous systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Photonic Reservoir Computing: Wavelength Division Multiplexing for Parallel Computing with a Silicon Microring Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...</description>

Abstract: Entanglement distribution is a critical technique that enables numerous quantum applications. Most fiber-based long-distance experiments reported to date have utilized photon pair sources generated in bulk optical crystals, with the entanglement encoded in the polarization degree of freedom. Here, we create time-energy entanglement for photon pairs generated from an on-chip silicon ring resonator via SFWM process and report the distribution of the entanglement over standard optical fiber with distance &gt;81 km. Our work paves the way for future large-scale quantum networks with connect of distant quantum nodes.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature efficient single-photon generation from CdSe/ZnS nanoplateletes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for materials for quantum information science applications, colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) have emerged as a highly promising new class of materials due to their interesting optical properties, such as narrow emission linewidth and fast photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes at room temperature. So far only few works focused on the quantum properties of their emission, however, NPLs, with their atomic-scale thickness and one-dimensional quantum confinement, are promising candidates for single-photon sources. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature single-photon emission from core/shell CdSe/ZnS NPLs, which feature 8$x$20 nm$^2$ surface area and 1 nm shell. The limited surface area ensures effective Auger non-radiative recombination, resulting in highly efficient single-photon generation with values of photon purity as low as $g^{(2)}(\tau)=0.04$. The observed long-period blinking and bleaching, typical of such thin shells, can be easily reduced by increasing the shell thickness. This work establishes NPLs as new single-photon sources very well suited for integration into quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Magnetic Switching of THz Signal in Planar Structured Spintronic Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm for Electromagnetic Scattering by Large Metasurfaces using a Static Mode Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, comprising large arrays of interacting subwavelength scatterers, pose significant challenges for general-purpose computational methods due to their large electric dimensions and multiscale nature. This paper introduces an efficient boundary element method specifically tailored for metasurfaces, leveraging the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation. Our method combines the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) with a representation of surface current density unknowns using static modes, a set of entire domain basis functions dependent only on object shape. The reduction in the number of unknowns by the static mode expansion (SME), combined with the \(\mathcal{O}(N \log N)\) complexity of MLFMA matrix-vector products, significantly reduces CPU time and memory requirements for solving scattering problems from metasurfaces compared to classical MLFMA with RWG basis functions. The MLFMA-SME method offers substantial benefits for the analysis and optimization of metalenses and metasurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the polarization properties of light in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum is crucial for molecular sensing, biomedical diagnostics, and IR imaging system technologies. Traditional methods, limited by bulky size and intricate fabrication, utilize large rotating optics for full Stokes polarization detection, impeding miniaturization and accuracy. Van der Waals materials (vdW) based devices can address these challenges due to their lithography-free fabrication, ease of integration with chip-scale platforms and room-temperature operation. This study introduces a chip-integrated polarimeter device leveraging the in-plane biaxial hyperbolic vdW crystal properties for mid-infrared light manipulation. The spatial division measurement scheme incorporates six meticulously designed linear and circular polarization filters, achieving high extinction ratios exceeding 30 dB and transmittance surpassing 50%, with fabrication tolerance of film thickness up to 100 nm. The proposed device represents a significant advancement in polarimetric detection, providing a compact, cost-effective solution and opens new avenues for on-chip mid-IR polarimetric detection in next-generation ultra-compact optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum technology, the interest in communication tasks assisted by quantum systems has increased both in academia and industry. Nonetheless, the transmission of a quantum state in real-world scenarios is bounded by environmental noise, so that the quantum channel is an open quantum system. In this work, we study a high dimensional non-Markovian open quantum system in a multi-core optical fiber by characterizing the environmental interaction as quantum operations, which here correspond to phase flips between pairs of computational basis states. The experimental platform is currently state-of-the-art for space division multiplexing optical fiber communication, which can serve as a robust channel for high-dimensional quantum communication. To test the channel, we perform a quantum communication task in the prepare-and-measure scenario. The non-Markovian nature of the system is demonstrated by implementing a Quantum Vault protocol. A better understanding of the phase noise in multi-core fibers could improve the stability and quality of several real-world communication protocols since they are a prime candidate to increase the telecom data transmission rate worldwide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing and optimizing optical amplifiers to maximize system performance is becoming increasingly important as optical communication systems strive to increase throughput. Offline optimization of optical amplifiers relies on models ranging from white-box models deeply rooted in physics to black-box data-driven and physics-agnostic models. Here, we compare the capabilities of white-, grey- and black-box models on the challenging test case of optimizing a bidirectional distributed Raman amplifier to achieve a target frequency-distance signal power profile. We show that any of the studied methods can achieve similar frequency and distance flatness of between 1 and 3.6 dB (depending on the definition of flatness) over the C-band in an 80-km span. Then, we discuss the models' applicability, advantages, and drawbacks based on the target application scenario, in particular in terms of flexibility, optimization speed, and access to training data.</description>

      <title>Quantum plasmonic sensing by Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum plasmonic sensor using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry that measures the refractive index of an analyte, embedded in a plasmonic beam splitter composed of a dual-Kretschmann configuration, which serves as a frustrated total internal reflection beamsplitter. The sensing performance of the HOM interferometry, combined with single-photon detectors, is evaluated through Fisher information for estimation of the refractive index of the analyte. This is subsequently compared with the classical benchmark that considers the injection of a coherent state of light into the plasmonic beamsplitter. By varying the wavelength of the single photons and the refractive index of the analyte, we identify a wide range where a 50 % quantum enhancement is achieved and discuss the observed behaviors in comparison with the classical benchmark. We expect this study to provide a useful insight into the advancement of quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, with direct implications for a wide range of nanophotonic beamsplitter structures.</description>

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where neighbouring cells nonlinearly compete for activation.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>
