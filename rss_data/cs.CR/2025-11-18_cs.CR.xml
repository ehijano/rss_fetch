      <title>Can AI Models be Jailbroken to Phish Elderly Victims? An End-to-End Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end demonstration of how attackers can exploit AI safety failures to harm vulnerable populations: from jailbreaking LLMs to generate phishing content, to deploying those messages against real targets, to successfully compromising elderly victims. We systematically evaluated safety guardrails across six frontier LLMs spanning four attack categories, revealing critical failures where several models exhibited near-complete susceptibility to certain attack vectors. In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud. Beyond generating phishing content, LLMs enable attackers to overcome language barriers and conduct multi-turn trust-building conversations at scale, fundamentally transforming fraud economics. While some providers report voluntary counter-abuse efforts, we argue these remain insufficient.</description>

      <title>NegBLEURT Forest: Leveraging Inconsistencies for Detecting Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks designed to bypass safety mechanisms pose a serious threat by prompting LLMs to generate harmful or inappropriate content, despite alignment with ethical guidelines. Crafting universal filtering rules remains difficult due to their inherent dependence on specific contexts. To address these challenges without relying on threshold calibration or model fine-tuning, this work introduces a semantic consistency analysis between successful and unsuccessful responses, demonstrating that a negation-aware scoring approach captures meaningful patterns. Building on this insight, a novel detection framework called NegBLEURT Forest is proposed to evaluate the degree of alignment between outputs elicited by adversarial prompts and expected safe behaviors. It identifies anomalous responses using the Isolation Forest algorithm, enabling reliable jailbreak detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently achieves top-tier performance, ranking first or second in accuracy across diverse models using the crafted dataset, while competing approaches exhibit notable sensitivity to model and data variations.</description>

      <title>Securing Generative AI in Healthcare: A Zero-Trust Architecture Powered by Confidential Computing on Google Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in healthcare is impeded by significant security challenges unaddressed by traditional frameworks, precisely the data-in-use gap where sensitive patient data and proprietary AI models are exposed during active processing. To address this, the paper proposes the Confidential Zero-Trust Framework (CZF), a novel security paradigm that synergistically combines Zero-Trust Architecture for granular access control with the hardware-enforced data isolation of Confidential Computing. We detailed a multi-tiered architectural blueprint for implementing the CZF on Google Cloud and analyzed its efficacy against real-world threats. The CZF provides a defense-in-depth architecture where data remains encrypted while in-use within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The framework's use of remote attestation offers cryptographic proof of workload integrity, transforming compliance from a procedural exercise into a verifiable technical fact and enabling secure, multi-party collaborations previously blocked by security and intellectual property concerns. By closing the data-in-use gap and enforcing Zero-Trust principles, the CZF provides a robust and verifiable framework that establishes the necessary foundation of trust to enable the responsible adoption of transformative AI technologies in healthcare.</description>

      <title>VULPO: Context-Aware Vulnerability Detection via On-Policy LLM Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread reliance on open-source software dramatically increases the risk of vulnerability exploitation, underscoring the need for effective and scalable vulnerability detection (VD). Existing VD techniques, whether traditional machine learning-based or LLM-based approaches like prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, or off-policy preference optimization, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform context-aware analysis: They depend on fixed inputs or static preference datasets, cannot adaptively explore repository-level dependencies, and are constrained by function-level benchmarks that overlook critical vulnerability context.
  This paper introduces Vulnerability-Adaptive Policy Optimization (VULPO), an on-policy LLM reinforcement learning framework for context-aware VD. To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy optimization, improving F1 by 85% over Qwen3-4B and achieving performance comparable to a 150x larger-scale model, DeepSeek-R1-0528.</description>

      <title>CITADEL: A Semi-Supervised Active Learning Framework for Malware Detection Under Continuous Distribution Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Android malware evolves rapidly, leading to concept drift that degrades the performance of traditional machine learning (ML)-based detection systems. While recent approaches incorporate active learning and hierarchical contrastive loss to handle this drift, they remain fully supervised, computationally expensive, and perform poorly on real-world datasets with long temporal spans. In particular, our evaluation highlights these limitations, particularly on LAMDA, a 12-year longitudinal dataset exhibiting substantial distributional shifts. Moreover, manual expert labeling cannot scale with the daily emergence of over 450,000 new malware samples, leaving most samples unlabeled and underutilized.
  To address these challenges, we propose CITADEL, a robust semi-supervised active learning framework for Android malware detection. To bridge the gap between image-domain semi-supervised learning and binary feature representations of malware, we introduce malware-specific augmentations, Bernoulli bit flips and masking, that simulate realistic drift behaviors. CITADEL further integrates supervised contrastive loss to improve boundary sample discrimination and combines it with a multi-criteria active learning strategy based on prediction confidence, $L_p$-norm distance, and boundary uncertainty, enabling effective adaptation under limited labeling budgets. Extensive evaluation on four large-scale Android malware benchmarks -- APIGraph, Chen-AZ, MaMaDroid, and LAMDA demonstrates that CITADEL outperforms prior work, achieving F1 score of over 1%, 3%, 7%, and 14% respectively, using only 40% labeled samples. Furthermore, CITADEL shows significant efficiency over prior work incurring $24\times$ faster training and $13\times$ fewer operations.</description>

      <title>BudgetLeak: Membership Inference Attacks on RAG Systems via the Generation Budget Side Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by integrating external knowledge, but reliance on proprietary or sensitive corpora poses various data risks, including privacy leakage and unauthorized data usage. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are a common technique to assess such risks, yet existing approaches underperform in RAG due to black-box constraints and the absence of strong membership signals. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored side channel in RAG systems: the generation budget, which controls the maximum number of tokens allowed in a generated response. Varying this budget reveals observable behavioral patterns between member and non-member queries, as members gain quality more rapidly with larger budgets. Building on this insight, we propose BudgetLeak, a novel membership inference attack that probes responses under different budgets and analyzes metric evolution via sequence modeling or clustering. Extensive experiments across four datasets, three LLM generators, and two retrievers demonstrate that BudgetLeak consistently outperforms existing baselines, while maintaining high efficiency and practical viability. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked data risk in RAG systems and highlight the need for new defenses.</description>

      <title>BackWeak: Backdooring Knowledge Distillation Simply with Weak Triggers and Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is essential for compressing large models, yet relying on pre-trained "teacher" models downloaded from third-party repositories introduces serious security risks -- most notably backdoor attacks. Existing KD backdoor methods are typically complex and computationally intensive: they employ surrogate student models and simulated distillation to guarantee transferability, and they construct triggers in a way similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which being not stealthy in magnitude, inherently exhibit strong adversarial behavior. This work questions whether such complexity is necessary and constructs stealthy "weak" triggers -- imperceptible perturbations that have negligible adversarial effect. We propose BackWeak, a simple, surrogate-free attack paradigm. BackWeak shows that a powerful backdoor can be implanted by simply fine-tuning a benign teacher with a weak trigger using a very small learning rate. We demonstrate that this delicate fine-tuning is sufficient to embed a backdoor that reliably transfers to diverse student architectures during a victim's standard distillation process, yielding high attack success rates. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, model architectures, and KD methods show that BackWeak is efficient, simpler, and often more stealthy than previous elaborate approaches. This work calls on researchers studying KD backdoor attacks to pay particular attention to the trigger's stealthiness and its potential adversarial characteristics.</description>

      <title>Exploring AI in Steganography and Steganalysis: Trends, Clusters, and Sustainable Development Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steganography and steganalysis are strongly related subjects of information security. Over the past decade, many powerful and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) - driven techniques have been designed and presented during research into steganography as well as steganalysis. This study presents a scientometric analysis of AI-driven steganography-based data hiding techniques using a thematic modelling approach. A total of 654 articles within the time span of 2017 to 2023 have been considered. Experimental evaluation of the study reveals that 69% of published articles are from Asian countries. The China is on top (TP:312), followed by India (TP-114). The study mainly identifies seven thematic clusters: steganographic image data hiding, deep image steganalysis, neural watermark robustness, linguistic steganography models, speech steganalysis algorithms, covert communication networks, and video steganography techniques. The proposed study also assesses the scope of AI-steganography under the purview of sustainable development goals (SDGs) to present the interdisciplinary reciprocity between them. It has been observed that only 18 of the 654 articles are aligned with one of the SDGs, which shows that limited studies conducted in alignment with SDG goals. SDG9 which is Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure is leading among 18 SDGs mapped articles. To the top of our insight, this study is the unique one to present a scientometric study on AI-driven steganography-based data hiding techniques. In the context of descriptive statistics, the study breaks down the underlying causes of observed trends, including the influence of DL developments, trends in East Asia and maturity of foundational methods. The work also stresses upon the critical gaps in societal alignment, particularly the SDGs, ultimately working on unveiling the field's global impact on AI security challenges.</description>

      <title>Explainable Transformer-Based Email Phishing Classification with Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing and related cyber threats are becoming more varied and technologically advanced. Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to disseminate malware or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users. This combined approach ensures precise phishing classification while providing easily understandable justifications for the model's decisions.</description>

      <title>AttackVLA: Benchmarking Adversarial and Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to interpret natural-language instructions and perform diverse tasks, yet their integration of perception, language, and control introduces new safety vulnerabilities. Despite growing interest in attacking such models, the effectiveness of existing techniques remains unclear due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present. We evaluate BackdoorVLA in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic settings, achieving an average targeted success rate of 58.4% and reaching 100% on selected tasks. Our work provides a standardized framework for evaluating VLA vulnerabilities and demonstrates the potential for precise adversarial manipulation, motivating further research on securing VLA-based embodied systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Collaborative Fuzzing with Continuous Reflection for Smart Contracts Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzing is a widely used technique for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, which generates transaction sequences to explore the execution paths of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers are falling short in detecting sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific attack transaction sequences with proper inputs to trigger, as they (i) prioritize code coverage over vulnerability discovery, wasting considerable effort on non-vulnerable code regions, and (ii) lack semantic understanding of stateful contracts, generating numerous invalid transaction sequences that cannot pass runtime execution.
  In this paper, we propose SmartFuzz, a novel collaborative reflective fuzzer for smart contract vulnerability detection. It employs large language model-driven agents as the fuzzing engine and continuously improves itself by learning and reflecting through interactions with the environment. Specifically, we first propose a new Continuous Reflection Process (CRP) for fuzzing smart contracts, which reforms the transaction sequence generation as a self-evolving process through continuous reflection on feedback from the runtime environment. Then, we present the Reactive Collaborative Chain (RCC) to orchestrate the fuzzing process into multiple sub-tasks based on the dependencies of transaction sequences. Furthermore, we design a multi-agent collaborative team, where each expert agent is guided by the RCC to jointly generate and refine transaction sequences from both global and local perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SmartFuzz's performance on real-world contracts and DApp projects. The results demonstrate that SmartFuzz outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools: (i) it detects 5.8\%-74.7\% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes, and (ii) it reduces false negatives by up to 80\%.</description>

      <title>RulePilot: An LLM-Powered Agent for Security Rule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time demand for system security leads to the detection rules becoming an integral part of the intrusion detection life-cycle. Rule-based detection often identifies malicious logs based on the predefined grammar logic, requiring experts with deep domain knowledge for rule generation. Therefore, automation of rule generation can result in significant time savings and ease the burden of rule-related tasks on security engineers. In this paper, we propose RulePilot, which mimics human expertise via LLM-based agent for addressing rule-related challenges like rule creation or conversion. Using RulePilot, the security analysts do not need to write down the rules following the grammar, instead, they can just provide the annotations such as the natural-language-based descriptions of a rule, our RulePilot can automatically generate the detection rules without more intervention. RulePilot is equipped with the intermediate representation (IR), which abstracts the complexity of config rules into structured, standardized formats, allowing LLMs to focus on generation rules in a more manageable and consistent way. We present a comprehensive evaluation of RulePilot in terms of textual similarity and execution success abilities, showcasing RulePilot can generate high-fidelity rules, outperforming the baseline models by up to 107.4% in textual similarity to ground truths and achieving better detection accuracy in real-world execution tests. We perform a case study from our industry collaborators in Singapore, showcasing that RulePilot significantly help junior analysts/general users in the rule creation process.</description>

      <title>eFPE: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Lightweight Format-Preserving Encryption Algorithm for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource-constrained embedded systems demand secure yet lightweight data protection, particularly when data formats must be preserved. This paper introduces eFPE (Enhanced Format-Preserving Encryption), an 8-round Feistel cipher featuring a "novel lightweight Pseudorandom Function (PRF)" specifically designed for this domain. The PRF, architected with an efficient two-iteration structure of AES-inspired operations (byte-substitution, keyed XOR, and byte-rotation), underpins eFPE's ability to directly encrypt even-length decimal strings without padding or complex conversions, while aiming for IND-CCA2 security under standard assumptions. Implemented and evaluated on an ARM7TDMI LPC2148 microcontroller using Keil {\mu}Vision 4, eFPE demonstrates the efficacy of its targeted design: a total firmware Read-Only Memory (ROM) footprint of 4.73 kB and Random Access Memory (RAM) usage of 1.34 kB. The core eFPE algorithm module itself is notably compact, requiring only 3.55 kB ROM and 116 B RAM. These characteristics make eFPE a distinct and highly suitable solution for applications like financial terminals, medical sensors, and industrial IoT devices where data format integrity, minimal resource footprint, and low operational latency are paramount.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web3 applications, built on blockchain technology, manage billions of dollars in digital assets through decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. These systems rely on complex, software supply chains that introduce significant security vulnerabilities. This paper examines the software supply chain security challenges unique to the Web3 ecosystem, where traditional Web2 software supply chain problems intersect with the immutable and high-stakes nature of blockchain technology. We analyze the threat landscape and propose mitigation strategies to strengthen the security posture of Web3 systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Prompt Injection Detection for LLMs Using Federated Learning and Embedding-Based NLP Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks are an emerging threat to large language models (LLMs), enabling malicious users to manipulate outputs through carefully designed inputs. Existing detection approaches often require centralizing prompt data, creating significant privacy risks. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving prompt injection detection framework based on federated learning and embedding-based classification. A curated dataset of benign and adversarial prompts was encoded with sentence embedding and used to train both centralized and federated logistic regression models. The federated approach preserved privacy by sharing only model parameters across clients, while achieving detection performance comparable to centralized training. Results demonstrate that effective prompt injection detection is feasible without exposing raw data, making this one of the first explorations of federated security for LLMs. Although the dataset is limited in scale, the findings establish a strong proof-of-concept and highlight new directions for building secure and privacy-aware LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Dyadic-Chaotic Lifting S-Boxes for Enhanced Physical-Layer Security within 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks will interconnect billions of resource-constrained devices and time-critical services, where classical, fixed, and heavy cryptography strains latency and energy budgets and struggles against large-scale, pre-computation attacks. Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $\beta$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling. Our proposed reconfigurable, lightweight S-box directly fulfills key PLS requirements of 6G networks by delivering fast, hardware-amenable confusion components with built-in agility against evolving threats.</description>

      <title>On the Security and Privacy of AI-based Mobile Health Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has impacted the development of mobile health (mHealth) apps, most notably with the advent of AI-based chatbots used as ubiquitous ``companions'' for various services, from fitness to mental health assistants. While these mHealth chatbots offer clear benefits, such as personalized health information and predictive diagnoses, they also raise significant concerns regarding security and privacy. This study empirically assesses 16 AI-based mHealth chatbots identified from the Google Play Store. The empirical assessment follows a three-phase approach (manual inspection, static code analysis, and dynamic analysis) to evaluate technical robustness and how design and implementation choices impact end users. Our findings revealed security vulnerabilities (e.g., enabling Remote WebView debugging), privacy issues, and non-compliance with Google Play policies (e.g., failure to provide publicly accessible privacy policies). Based on our findings, we offer several recommendations to enhance the security and privacy of mHealth chatbots. These recommendations focus on improving data handling processes, disclosure, and user security. Therefore, this work also seeks to support mHealth developers and security/privacy engineers in designing more transparent, privacy-friendly, and secure mHealth chatbots.</description>

      <title>GenSIaC: Toward Security-Aware Infrastructure-as-Code Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical approach for managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code and automation. IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.
  While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.
  To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858. Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities.</description>

      <title>GRAPHTEXTACK: A Realistic Black-Box Node Injection Attack on LLM-Enhanced GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs), which combine structural and textual node information, are ubiquitous across many domains. Recent work integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to jointly model semantics and structure, resulting in more general and expressive models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on TAG benchmarks. However, this integration introduces dual vulnerabilities: GNNs are sensitive to structural perturbations, while LLM-derived features are vulnerable to prompt injection and adversarial phrasing. While existing adversarial attacks largely perturb structure or text independently, we find that uni-modal attacks cause only modest degradation in LLM-enhanced GNNs. Moreover, many existing attacks assume unrealistic capabilities, such as white-box access or direct modification of graph data. To address these gaps, we propose GRAPHTEXTACK, the first black-box, multi-modal{, poisoning} node injection attack for LLM-enhanced GNNs. GRAPHTEXTACK injects nodes with carefully crafted structure and semantics to degrade model performance, operating under a realistic threat model without relying on model internals or surrogate models. To navigate the combinatorial, non-differentiable search space of connectivity and feature assignments, GRAPHTEXTACK introduces a novel evolutionary optimization framework with a multi-objective fitness function that balances local prediction disruption and global graph influence. Extensive experiments on five datasets and two state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced GNN models show that GRAPHTEXTACK significantly outperforms 12 strong baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SeedAIchemy, an automated LLM-driven corpus generation tool that makes it easier for developers to implement fuzzing effectively. SeedAIchemy consists of five modules which implement different approaches at collecting publicly available files from the internet. Four of the five modules use large language model (LLM) workflows to construct search terms designed to maximize corpus quality. Corpora generated by SeedAIchemy perform significantly better than a naive corpus and similarly to a manually-curated corpus on a diverse range of target programs and libraries.</description>

      <title>A Content-Preserving Secure Linguistic Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing linguistic steganography methods primarily rely on content transformations to conceal secret messages. However, they often cause subtle yet looking-innocent deviations between normal and stego texts, posing potential security risks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a content-preserving linguistic steganography paradigm for perfectly secure covert communication without modifying the cover text. Based on this paradigm, we introduce CLstega (\textit{C}ontent-preserving \textit{L}inguistic \textit{stega}nography), a novel method that embeds secret messages through controllable distribution transformation. CLstega first applies an augmented masking strategy to locate and mask embedding positions, where MLM(masked language model)-predicted probability distributions are easily adjustable for transformation. Subsequently, a dynamic distribution steganographic coding strategy is designed to encode secret messages by deriving target distributions from the original probability distributions. To achieve this transformation, CLstega elaborately selects target words for embedding positions as labels to construct a masked sentence dataset, which is used to fine-tune the original MLM, producing a target MLM capable of directly extracting secret messages from the cover text. This approach ensures perfect security of secret messages while fully preserving the integrity of the original cover text. Experimental results show that CLstega can achieve a 100\% extraction success rate, and outperforms existing methods in security, effectively balancing embedding capacity and security.</description>

      <title>Prrr: Personal Random Rewards for Blockchain Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contracts, the stateful programs running on blockchains, often rely on reports. Publishers are paid to publish these reports on the blockchain. Designing protocols that incentivize timely reporting is the prevalent reporting problem. But existing solutions face a security-performance trade-off: Relying on a small set of trusted publishers introduces centralization risks, while allowing open publication results in an excessive number of reports on the blockchain. We identify the root cause of this trade-off to be the standard symmetric reward design, which treats all reports equally. We prove that no symmetric-reward mechanism can overcome the trade-off.
  We present Personal Random Rewards for Reporting (Prrr), a protocol that assigns random heterogeneous values to reports. We call this novel mechanism-design concept Ex-Ante Synthetic Asymmetry. To the best of our knowledge, Prrr is the first game-theoretic mechanism (in any context) that deliberately forms participant asymmetry. Prrr employs a second-price-style settlement to allocate rewards, ensuring incentive compatibility and achieving both security and efficiency. Following the protocol constitutes a Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium, robust against collusion and Sybil attacks. Prrr is applicable to numerous smart contracts that rely on timely reports.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dual-Layer Web Application Firewall (ADL-WAF) Leveraging Machine Learning for Enhanced Anomaly and Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web Application Firewalls are crucial for protecting web applications against a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Web Application Firewalls often struggle to effectively distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic, leading to limited efficacy in threat detection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Dual-Layer WAF employing a two-layered Machine Learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of anomaly and threat detection. The first layer employs a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to detect anomalies by identifying traffic deviations from established normal patterns. The second layer employs Support Vector Machine to classify these anomalies as either threat anomalies or benign anomalies. Our Adaptive Dual Layer WAF incorporates comprehensive data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques and has been thoroughly evaluated using five large benchmark datasets. Evaluation using these datasets shows that ADL WAF achieves a detection accuracy of 99.88% and a precision of 100%, significantly enhancing anomaly detection and reducing false positives. These findings suggest that integrating machine learning techniques into WAFs can substantially improve web application security by providing more accurate and efficient threat detection.</description>

      <title>Scalable Hierarchical AI-Blockchain Framework for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Large-Scale Autonomous Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of autonomous vehicle networks is facing major challenges, owing to the complexity of sensor integration, real-time performance demands, and distributed communication protocols that expose vast attack surfaces around both individual and network-wide safety. Existing security schemes are unable to provide sub-10 ms (milliseconds) anomaly detection and distributed coordination of large-scale networks of vehicles within an acceptable safety/privacy framework. This paper introduces a three-tier hybrid security architecture HAVEN (Hierarchical Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Network), which decouples real-time local threat detection and distributed coordination operations. It incorporates a light ensemble anomaly detection model on the edge (first layer), Byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning to aggregate threat intelligence at a regional scale (middle layer), and selected blockchain mechanisms (top layer) to ensure critical security coordination. Extensive experimentation is done on a real-world autonomous driving dataset. Large-scale simulations with the number of vehicles ranging between 100 and 1000 and different attack types, such as sensor spoofing, jamming, and adversarial model poisoning, are conducted to test the scalability and resiliency of HAVEN. Experimental findings show sub-10 ms detection latency with an accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 92% across multimodal sensor data, Byzantine fault tolerance validated with 20\% compromised nodes, and a reduced blockchain storage overhead, guaranteeing sufficient differential privacy. The proposed framework overcomes the important trade-off between real-time safety obligation and distributed security coordination with novel three-tiered processing. The scalable architecture of HAVEN is shown to provide great improvement in detection accuracy as well as network resilience over other methods.</description>

      <title>AI Bill of Materials and Beyond: Systematizing Security Assurance through the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assurance for artificial intelligence (AI) systems remains fragmented across software supply-chain security, adversarial machine learning, and governance documentation. Existing transparency mechanisms - including Model Cards, Datasheets, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) - advance provenance reporting but rarely provide verifiable, machine-readable evidence of model security. This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields. The AIRS Framework thus extends SBOM practice to the AI domain by coupling threat modeling with automated, auditable evidence generation, providing a principled foundation for standardized, trustworthy, and machine-verifiable AI risk documentation.</description>

      <title>Offensive tool determination strategy R.I.D.D.L.E. + (C)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intentional threats are a major risk factor related to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure assets, and an accurate risk assessment is necessary to analyze threats, assess vulnerabilities, and evaluate potential impacts on assets and systems. This research proposes a methodology that can be added as an additional phase in the risk assessment process. The method introduces an extra analytical parameter concerning offensive tool characteristics, improving the understanding of intentional threats.
  The methodology is presented using clear and accessible language suitable for a broad audience. It is based on an approach described as an "offensive tool determination strategy," summarized by the acronym R.I.D.D.L.E.+C, which refers to the variables used in the analysis: resistance, intrusion timing, damage, disruption timing, latency, efficiency, and cost. These variables are evaluated using open-source intelligence.
  Each variable is assigned a specific range of values according to its potential impact on the targeted asset. A matrix is then provided for practical application, which can reveal unexpected vulnerabilities and offer a more granular framework for decision-making and security planning.</description>

      <title>ProxyPrints: From Database Breach to Spoof, A Plug-and-Play Defense for Biometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprint recognition systems are widely deployed for authentication and forensic applications, but the security of stored fingerprint data remains a critical vulnerability. While many systems avoid storing raw fingerprint images in favor of minutiae-based templates, recent research shows that these templates can be reverse-engineered to reconstruct realistic fingerprint images, enabling physical spoofing attacks that compromise user identities with no means of remediation.
  We present ProxyPrints, the first practical defense that brings cancellable biometrics to existing fingerprint recognition systems without requiring modifications to proprietary matching software. ProxyPrints acts as a transparent middleware layer between the fingerprint scanner and the matching algorithm, transforming each scanned fingerprint into a consistent, unlinkable alias. This transformation allows biometric identities to be revoked and replaced in the event of a breach, without affecting authentication accuracy. Additionally, ProxyPrints provides organizations with breach detection capabilities by enabling the identification of out-of-band spoofing attempts involving compromised aliases.
  We evaluate ProxyPrints on standard benchmark datasets and commercial fingerprint recognition systems, demonstrating that it preserves matching performance while offering strong security and revocability. Our open-source implementation includes tools for alias generation and deployment in real-world pipelines, making ProxyPrints a drop-in, scalable solution for fingerprint data protection.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation Framework for Network IDS/IPS Datasets: Leveraging MITRE ATT&amp;CK and Industry Relevance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) is critically dependent on the relevance and quality of the datasets used for training and evaluation. However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&amp;CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments.</description>

      <title>Whose Narrative is it Anyway? A KV Cache Manipulation Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Key Value(KV) cache is an important component for efficient inference in autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs), but its role as a representation of the model's internal state makes it a potential target for integrity attacks. This paper introduces "History Swapping," a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity of High-Altitude Platform Stations: Threat Taxonomy, Attacks and Defenses with Standards Mapping - DDoS Attack Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are emerging stratospheric nodes within non-terrestrial networks. We provide a structured overview of HAPS subsystems and principal communication links, map cybersecurity and privacy exposure across communication, control, and power subsystems, and propose a stratosphere-aware threat taxonomy. We then discuss defenses feasible under HAPS constraints including encryption and authentication, frequency agility, directional and beam-steered antennas, intrusion detection, secure boot, and software and supply-chain assurance-while highlighting how they align with emerging regulatory and standards guidance. Finally, we report a simulation-based case study using OMNeT++/INET to characterize distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) impact on service and control-plane availability, and summarize regulatory and standardization considerations relevant to deployment. We conclude with concrete future research directions. The study is simulation-grounded and intended to inform engineering trade-offs for real-world HAPS deployments rather than serve as an on-air validation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adversarial Malware Defense via Trust-Based Raw Override and Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of robust malware detection systems in big data environments requires careful consideration of both security effectiveness and computational efficiency. While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning from Partial Decryption Verifiable Threshold Multi-Client Functional Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties can cooperate to train the model without directly exchanging their own private data, but the gradient leakage problem still threatens the privacy security and model integrity. Although the existing scheme uses threshold cryptography to mitigate the inference attack, it can not guarantee the verifiability of the aggregation results, making the system vulnerable to the threat of poisoning attack. We construct a partial decryption verifiable threshold multi client function encryption scheme, and apply it to Federated learning to implement the federated learning verifiable threshold security aggregation protocol (VTSAFL). VTSAFL empowers clients to verify aggregation results, concurrently minimizing both computational and communication overhead. The size of the functional key and partial decryption results of the scheme are constant, which provides efficiency guarantee for large-scale deployment. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that vtsafl can achieve the same accuracy as the existing scheme, while reducing the total training time by more than 40%, and reducing the communication overhead by up to 50%. This efficiency is critical for overcoming the resource constraints inherent in Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</description>

      <title>Esim: EVM Bytecode Similarity Detection Based on Stable-Semantic Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is experiencing rapid expansion. However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection.
  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search.</description>

      <title>The Grain Family of Stream Ciphers: an Abstraction, Strengthening of Components and New Concrete Instantiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first contribution of the paper is to put forward an abstract definition of the Grain family of stream ciphers which formalises the different components that are required to specify a particular member of the family. Our second contribution is to provide new and strengthened definitions of the components. These include definining new classes of nonlinear Boolean functions, improved definition of the state update function during initialisation, choice of the tap positions, and the possibility of the linear feedback shift register being smaller than the nonlinear feedback shift register. The third contribution of the paper is to put forward seven concrete proposals of stream ciphers by suitably instantiating the abstract family, one at the 80-bit security level, and two each at the 128-bit, 192-bit, and the 256-bit security levels. At the 80-bit security level, compared to the well known Grain~v1, the new proposal uses Boolean functions with improved cryptographic properties \textit{and} an overall lower gate count. At the 128-bit level, compared to ISO/IEC standard Grain-128a, the new proposals use Boolean functions with improved cryptographic properties; one of the proposals require a few extra gates, while the other has an overall lower gate count. At the 192-bit, and the 256-bit security levels, there are no proposals in the literature with smaller gate counts.</description>

      <title>SafeGRPO: Self-Rewarded Multimodal Safety Alignment via Rule-Governed Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, yet their expanded modality space introduces new compositional safety risks that emerge from complex text-image interactions. Such cross-modal couplings can produce unsafe semantics even when individual inputs are benign, exposing the fragile safety awareness of current MLLMs. While recent works enhance safety by guiding models to reason about potential risks, unregulated reasoning traces may compromise alignment; although Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers self-rewarded refinement without human supervision, it lacks verifiable signals for reasoning safety. To address this, we propose SafeGRPO a self-rewarded multimodal safety alignment framework that integrates rule-governed reward construction into GRPO, enabling interpretable and verifiable optimization of reasoning safety. Built upon the constructed SafeTag-VL-3K dataset with explicit visual, textual, and combined safety tags, SafeGRPO performs step-guided safety thinking to enforce structured reasoning and behavior alignment, substantially improving multimodal safety awareness, compositional robustness, and reasoning stability across diverse benchmarks without sacrificing general capabilities.</description>

      <title>SoK: The Last Line of Defense: On Backdoor Defense Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models by implanting hidden vulnerabilities that can be activated by malicious inputs. While numerous defenses have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, the heterogeneous landscape of evaluation methodologies hinders fair comparison between defenses. This work presents a systematic (meta-)analysis of backdoor defenses through a comprehensive literature review and empirical evaluation. We analyzed 183 backdoor defense papers published between 2018 and 2025 across major AI and security venues, examining the properties and evaluation methodologies of these defenses.
  Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in experimental setups, evaluation metrics, and threat model assumptions in the literature. Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations. Our work aims to equip researchers and industry practitioners with actionable insights for developing, assessing, and deploying defenses to different systems.</description>

      <title>A Secure Semantic Communication System Based on Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to ensure the security of textual data transmission in a semantic communication system. In the proposed system, a sender transmits textual information to a receiver, while a potential eavesdropper attempts to intercept the information. At the sender side, the text is initially preprocessed, where each sentence is annotated with its corresponding topic, and subsequently extracted into a knowledge graph. To achieve the secure transmission of the knowledge graph, we propose a channel encryption scheme that integrates constellation diagonal transformation with multi-parameter weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). At the receiver side, the textual data is first decrypted, and then recovered via a transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the probability of information compromise. The legitimate receiver achieves a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.9, whereas the BLEU score of the eavesdropper remains below 0.3. Compared to the baselines, the proposed method can improve the security by up to 20%.</description>

      <title>DualTAP: A Dual-Task Adversarial Protector for Mobile MLLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliance of mobile GUI agents on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduces a severe privacy vulnerability: screenshots containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are often sent to untrusted, third-party routers. These routers can exploit their own MLLMs to mine this data, violating user privacy. Existing privacy perturbations fail the critical dual challenge of this scenario: protecting PII from the router's MLLM while simultaneously preserving task utility for the agent's MLLM. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Task Adversarial Protector (DualTAP), a novel framework that, for the first time, explicitly decouples these conflicting objectives. DualTAP trains a lightweight generator using two key innovations: (i) a contrastive attention module that precisely identifies and targets only the PII-sensitive regions, and (ii) a dual-task adversarial objective that simultaneously minimizes a task-preservation loss (to maintain agent utility) and a privacy-interference loss (to suppress PII leakage). To facilitate this study, we introduce PrivScreen, a new dataset of annotated mobile screenshots designed specifically for this dual-task evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) demonstrate DualTAP's state-of-the-art protection. It reduces the average privacy leakage rate by 31.6 percentage points (a 3.0x relative improvement) while, critically, maintaining an 80.8% task success rate - a negligible drop from the 83.6% unprotected baseline. DualTAP presents the first viable solution to the privacy-utility trade-off in mobile MLLM agents.</description>

      <title>Whistledown: Combining User-Level Privacy with Conversational Coherence in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for personal, emotionally charged, and socially sensitive conversations. However, prompts sent to cloud-hosted models can contain personally identifiable information (PII) that users do not want logged, retained, or leaked. We observe this to be especially acute when users discuss friends, coworkers, or adversaries, i.e., when they spill the tea. Enterprises face the same challenge when they want to use LLMs for internal communication and decision-making.
  In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM. Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $\epsilon$-local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users. For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure. Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers.</description>

      <title>AutoMalDesc: Large-Scale Script Analysis for Cyber Threat Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating thorough natural language explanations for threat detections remains an open problem in cybersecurity research, despite significant advances in automated malware detection systems. In this work, we present AutoMalDesc, an automated static analysis summarization framework that, following initial training on a small set of expert-curated examples, operates independently at scale. This approach leverages an iterative self-paced learning pipeline to progressively enhance output quality through synthetic data generation and validation cycles, eliminating the need for extensive manual data annotation. Evaluation across 3,600 diverse samples in five scripting languages demonstrates statistically significant improvements between iterations, showing consistent gains in both summary quality and classification accuracy. Our comprehensive validation approach combines quantitative metrics based on established malware labels with qualitative assessment from both human experts and LLM-based judges, confirming both technical precision and linguistic coherence of generated summaries. To facilitate reproducibility and advance research in this domain, we publish our complete dataset of more than 100K script samples, including annotated seed (0.9K) and test (3.6K) datasets, along with our methodology and evaluation framework.</description>

      <title>Enhancing All-to-X Backdoor Attacks with Optimized Target Class Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose severe threats to machine learning systems, prompting extensive research in this area. However, most existing work focuses on single-target All-to-One (A2O) attacks, overlooking the more complex All-to-X (A2X) attacks with multiple target classes, which are often assumed to have low attack success rates. In this paper, we first demonstrate that A2X attacks are robust against state-of-the-art defenses. We then propose a novel attack strategy that enhances the success rate of A2X attacks while maintaining robustness by optimizing grouping and target class assignment mechanisms. Our method improves the attack success rate by up to 28%, with average improvements of 6.7%, 16.4%, 14.1% on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively. We anticipate that this study will raise awareness of A2X attacks and stimulate further research in this under-explored area.

      <title>InfoDecom: Decomposing Information for Defending against Privacy Leakage in Split Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split inference (SI) enables users to access deep learning (DL) services without directly transmitting raw data. However, recent studies reveal that data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) can recover the original inputs from the smashed data sent from the client to the server, leading to significant privacy leakage. While various defenses have been proposed, they often result in substantial utility degradation, particularly when the client-side model is shallow. We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines. The code and the appendix are available at https://github.com/SASA-cloud/InfoDecom.</description>

      <title>Tight and Practical Privacy Auditing for Differentially Private In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform in-context learning (ICL) by adapting to tasks from prompt demonstrations, which in practice often contain private or proprietary data. Although differential privacy (DP) with private voting is a pragmatic mitigation, DP-ICL implementations are error-prone, and worst-case DP bounds may substantially overestimate actual leakage, calling for practical auditing tools. We present a tight and efficient privacy auditing framework for DP-ICL systems that runs membership inference attacks and translates their success rates into empirical privacy guarantees using Gaussian DP. Our analysis of the private voting mechanism identifies vote configurations that maximize the auditing signal, guiding the design of audit queries that reliably reveal whether a canary demonstration is present in the context. The framework supports both black-box (API-only) and white-box (internal vote) threat models, and unifies auditing for classification and generation by reducing both to a binary decision problem. Experiments on standard text classification and generation benchmarks show that our empirical leakage estimates closely match theoretical DP budgets on classification tasks and are consistently lower on generation tasks due to conservative embedding-sensitivity bounds, making our framework a practical privacy auditor and verifier for real-world DP-ICL deployments.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Ransomware Detection Using Hybrid Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis of BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa Through LIME and SHAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware continues to evolve in complexity, making early and explainable detection a critical requirement for modern cybersecurity systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of three Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa) for ransomware detection using two structured datasets: UGRansome and Process Memory (PM). Since LLMs are primarily designed for natural language processing (NLP), numerical and categorical ransomware features were transformed into textual sequences using KBinsDiscretizer and token-based encoding. This enabled the models to learn behavioural patterns from system activity and network traffic through contextual embeddings. The models were fine-tuned on approximately 2,500 labelled samples and evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. To ensure transparent decision-making in this high-stakes domain, two explainable AI techniques (LIME and SHAP) were applied to interpret feature contributions. The results show that the models learn distinct ransomware-related cues: BERT relies heavily on dominant file-operation features, RoBERTa demonstrates balanced reliance on network and financial signals, while DeBERTa exhibits strong sensitivity to financial and network-traffic indicators. Visualisation of embeddings further reveals structural differences in token representation, with RoBERTa producing more isotropic embeddings and DeBERTa capturing highly directional, disentangled patterns. In general, RoBERTa achieved the strongest F1-score, while BERT yielded the highest ROC-AUC performance. The integration of LLMs with XAI provides a transparent framework capable of identifying feature-level evidence behind ransomware predictions.</description>

      <title>ForgeDAN: An Evolutionary Framework for Jailbreaking Aligned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has brought both transformative applications and new security risks, including jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards to elicit harmful outputs. Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effectiveness of Google Play Store's Privacy Transparency Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the requirements and emphases on privacy transparency placed by regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, the Google Play Store requires Android developers to more responsibly communicate their apps' privacy practices to potential users by providing the proper information via the data safety, privacy policy, and permission manifest privacy transparency channels. However, it is unclear how effective those channels are in helping users make informed decisions in the app selection and installation process. In this article, we conducted a study for 190 participants to interact with our simulated privacy transparency channels of mobile apps. We quantitatively analyzed (supplemented by qualitative analysis) participants' responses to five sets of questions. We found that data safety provides the most intuitive user interfaces, privacy policy is most informative and effective, while permission manifest excels at raising participants' concerns about an app's overall privacy risks. These channels complement each other and should all be improved.</description>

      <title>Robust Client-Server Watermarking for Split Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is renowned for its privacy-preserving nature and low computational overhead among decentralized machine learning paradigms. In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks.</description>

      <title>It's a Feature, Not a Bug: Secure and Auditable State Rollback for Confidential Cloud Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replay and rollback attacks threaten cloud application integrity by reintroducing authentic yet stale data through an untrusted storage interface to compromise application decision-making. Prior security frameworks mitigate these attacks by enforcing forward-only state transitions (state continuity) with hardware-backed mechanisms, but they categorically treat all rollback as malicious and thus preclude legitimate rollbacks used for operational recovery from corruption or misconfiguration. We present Rebound, a general-purpose security framework that preserves rollback protection while enabling policy-authorized legitimate rollbacks of application binaries, configuration, and data. Key to Rebound is a reference monitor that mediates state transitions, enforces authorization policy, guarantees atomicity of state updates and rollbacks, and emits a tamper-evident log that provides transparency to applications and auditors. We formally prove Rebound's security properties and show through an application case study -- with software deployment workflows in GitLab CI -- that it enables robust control over binary, configuration, and raw data versioning with low end-to-end overhead.</description>

      <title>TZ-LLM: Protecting On-Device Large Language Models with Arm TrustZone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on mobile devices offer benefits like user privacy and reduced network latency, but introduce a significant security risk: the leakage of proprietary models to end users.
  To mitigate this risk, we propose a system design for protecting on-device LLMs using Arm Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), TrustZone. Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.
  Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.
  We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.</description>

      <title>A New Quantum Secure Time Transfer System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision clock synchronization is essential for a wide range of network-distributed applications. In the quantum space, these applications include communication, sensing, and positioning. However, current synchronization techniques are vulnerable to attacks, such as intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, and delay attacks. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system, subsequently used for clock synchronization, that largely negates such attacks. Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data. With these enhancements, we argue that our new system represents the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.</description>

      <title>Output Supervision Can Obfuscate the Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OpenAI (2025) showed that training against a chain of thought (CoT) monitor can cause obfuscated CoTs, which contain bad behavior the monitor cannot detect. They proposed to keep CoTs monitorable by training only against output monitors that do not have access to CoT. We show that such training can still cause obfuscated CoTs via two mechanisms. First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced. We introduce two mitigations to address these two issues, which achieve a Pareto improvement in terms of monitorability and task performance compared to regular training.</description>

      <title>MedFedPure: A Medical Federated Framework with MAE-based Detection and Diffusion Purification for Inference-Time Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential in medical imaging, particularly for brain tumor detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the models remain vulnerable at inference time when they are trained collaboratively through Federated Learning (FL), an approach adopted to protect patient privacy. Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%. By operating locally and in real time during diagnosis, our framework provides a practical path to deploying secure, trustworthy, and privacy-preserving AI tools in clinical workflows.

      <title>Value-Aligned Prompt Moderation via Zero-Shot Agentic Rewriting for Safe Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative vision-language models like Stable Diffusion demonstrate remarkable capabilities in creative media synthesis, but they also pose substantial risks of producing unsafe, offensive, or culturally inappropriate content when prompted adversarially. Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Pediatric Pneumonia Detection: Enabling Collaborative Diagnosis Without Sharing Patient Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-rays (CXRs) is clinically critical to expedite treatment and isolation, reduce complications, and curb unnecessary antibiotic use. Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.
  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains.</description>

      <title>On the Trade-Off Between Transparency and Security in Adversarial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency and security are both central to Responsible AI, but they may conflict in adversarial settings. We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.</description>

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of pretrained models and open repositories has made model merging a convenient yet risky practice, allowing free-riders to combine fine-tuned models into a new multi-capability model without authorization. Such unauthorized model merging not only violates intellectual property rights but also undermines model ownership and accountability. To address this issue, we present MergeGuard, a proactive dual-stage weight protection framework that disrupts merging compatibility while maintaining task fidelity. In the first stage, we redistribute task-relevant information across layers via L2-regularized optimization, ensuring that important gradients are evenly dispersed. In the second stage, we inject structured perturbations to misalign task subspaces, breaking curvature compatibility in the loss landscape. Together, these stages reshape the model's parameter geometry such that merged models collapse into destructive interference while the protected model remains fully functional. Extensive experiments on both vision (ViT-L-14) and language (Llama2, Gemma2, Mistral) models demonstrate that MergeGuard reduces merged model accuracy by up to 90% with less than 1.5% performance loss on the protected model.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Study of Model Extraction Attacks on Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning has advanced rapidly in tasks such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and node classification. As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems.</description>

      <title>Forgetting-MarI: LLM Unlearning via Marginal Information Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>DeiTFake: Deepfake Detection Model using DeiT Multi-Stage Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes are major threats to the integrity of digital media. We propose DeiTFake, a DeiT-based transformer and a novel two-stage progressive training strategy with increasing augmentation complexity. The approach applies an initial transfer-learning phase with standard augmentations followed by a fine-tuning phase using advanced affine and deepfake-specific augmentations. DeiT's knowledge distillation model captures subtle manipulation artifacts, increasing robustness of the detection model. Trained on the OpenForensics dataset (190,335 images), DeiTFake achieves 98.71\% accuracy after stage one and 99.22\% accuracy with an AUROC of 0.9997, after stage two, outperforming the latest OpenForensics baselines. We analyze augmentation impact and training schedules, and provide practical benchmarks for facial deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Adversarial Sampling: Multi-Armed Bandit-Guided Generalization Against Unforeseen Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to various adversarial perturbations. To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT frameworks primarily focus on a single or a limited set of attack types, leaving DNNs still exposed to attack types that may be encountered in practice but not addressed during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CAS achieves superior overall robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy, providing a new paradigm for robust generalization of DNNs.</description>

      <title>An Improved Quantum Anonymous Notification Protocol for Quantum-Augmented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalability of current quantum networks is limited due to noisy quantum components and high implementation costs, thereby limiting the security advantages that quantum networks provide over their classical counterparts. Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network. Finally, we discuss how this notification layer integrates with QuANets so that receivers can allow switch-bypass handling of quantum payloads, reducing header-based information leakage and vulnerability to targeted interference at compromised switches.</description>

      <title>The 'Sure' Trap: Multi-Scale Poisoning Analysis of Stealthy Compliance-Only Backdoors in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically couple a secret trigger to an explicit malicious output. We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response "Sure" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the "Sure" rate approaches 100\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors.</description>

      <title>SGuard-v1: Safety Guardrail for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SGuard-v1, a lightweight safety guardrail for Large Language Models (LLMs), which comprises two specialized models to detect harmful content and screen adversarial prompts in human-AI conversational settings. The first component, ContentFilter, is trained to identify safety risks in LLM prompts and responses in accordance with the MLCommons hazard taxonomy, a comprehensive framework for trust and safety assessment of AI. The second component, JailbreakFilter, is trained with a carefully designed curriculum over integrated datasets and findings from prior work on adversarial prompting, covering 60 major attack types while mitigating false-unsafe classification. SGuard-v1 is built on the 2B-parameter Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct model that supports 12 languages. We curate approximately 1.4 million training instances from both collected and synthesized data and perform instruction tuning on the base model, distributing the curated data across the two component according to their designated functions. Through extensive evaluation on public and proprietary safety benchmarks, SGuard-v1 achieves state-of-the-art safety performance while remaining lightweight, thereby reducing deployment overhead. SGuard-v1 also improves interpretability for downstream use by providing multi-class safety predictions and their binary confidence scores. We release the SGuard-v1 under the Apache-2.0 License to enable further research and practical deployment in AI safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean functions with strong cryptographic properties, such as high nonlinearity and algebraic degree, are important for the security of stream and block ciphers. These functions can be designed using algebraic constructions or metaheuristics. This paper examines the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve homogeneous bent Boolean functions, that is, functions whose algebraic normal form contains only monomials of the same degree and that are maximally nonlinear. We introduce the notion of density of homogeneous bent functions, facilitating the algorithmic design that results in finding quadratic and cubic bent functions in different numbers of variables.</description>

      <title>FLClear: Visually Verifiable Multi-Client Watermarking for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model while preserving the privacy of their local data. Within this paradigm, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of client models are critical assets that must be protected. In practice, the central server responsible for maintaining the global model may maliciously manipulate the global model to erase client contributions or falsely claim sole ownership, thereby infringing on clients' IPR. Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods.</description>

      <title>Evolve the Method, Not the Prompts: Evolutionary Synthesis of Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated red teaming frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, yet they share a fundamental limitation: their jailbreak logic is confined to selecting, combining, or refining pre-existing attack strategies. This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods. We release our framework to facilitate future research in this new direction of evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods.

      <description>arXiv:2511.12782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Large Language Model alignment research mostly focuses on improving model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on examples and prompting. Research has shown that LLM jailbreak probability increases with the size of the user input or conversation length. There is a lack of appropriate research into means of strengthening alignment which also scale with user input length. We propose interruptions as a possible solution to this problem. Interruptions are control sentences added to the user input approximately every x tokens for some arbitrary x. We suggest that this can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming.</description>

Abstract: Personal communication using technical means is protected by telecommunications secrecy. Any interference with this fundamental right requires a legal basis, which has existed for many years for traditional communication services in the form of telecommunications surveillance (TK\"U, {\S} 100a StPO) and appears to be widely accepted by society. The basis for the implementation of TK\"U is the obligation of telecommunications providers to provide interception interfaces. However, the technical implementation of telecommunications has changed significantly as a result of the Internet. Messenger services and Voice over IP telephony are increasingly competing with traditional telephone services. The use of strong end-to-end encryption made possible by this technology is increasingly posing problems for law enforcement agencies, as only cryptographically encrypted content is accessible via the interception interfaces provided to date. Against the backdrop of current discussions on socalled ``chat control'' and its limited social acceptance, this article addresses the question of whether and, if so, how the cooperation obligations of the technical actors involved can be sensibly regulated in the case of encrypted communication.</description>

      <title>T2I-Based Physical-World Appearance Attack against Traffic Sign Recognition Systems in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems play a critical role in Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, enabling real-time detection of road signs, such as STOP and speed limit signs. While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types.
  In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities and are analyzed by experts as well as automated systems, such as static analysis and AI-assisted solutions. However, audit artifacts are heterogeneous and often lack reproducible, executable PoC tests suitable for automated validation, leading to costly, ad hoc manual verification. Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to turn audit reports into PoC test cases, but have three major challenges: noisy inputs, hallucinations, and missing runtime oracles. In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively. Applied to the latest Etherscan verified-source corpus, SmartPoC confirms 236 real bugs out of 545 audit findings at a cost of only $0.03 per finding.</description>

      <title>VEIL: Jailbreaking Text-to-Video Models via Visual Exploitation from Implicit Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.</description>

      <title>RegionMarker: A Region-Triggered Semantic Watermarking Framework for Embedding-as-a-Service Copyright Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) is an effective and convenient deployment solution for addressing various NLP tasks. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS.</description>

      <title>Tuning for Two Adversaries: Enhancing the Robustness Against Transfer and Query-Based Attacks using Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first detailed analysis of how optimization hyperparameters -- such as learning rate, weight decay, momentum, and batch size -- influence robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.</description>

      <title>Identify As A Human Does: A Pathfinder of Next-Generation Anti-Cheat Framework for First-Person Shooter Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gaming industry has experienced substantial growth, but cheating in online games poses a significant threat to the integrity of the gaming experience. Cheating, particularly in first-person shooter (FPS) games, can lead to substantial losses for the game industry. Existing anti-cheat solutions have limitations, such as client-side hardware constraints, security risks, server-side unreliable methods, and both-sides suffer from a lack of comprehensive real-world datasets. To address these limitations, the paper proposes HAWK, a server-side FPS anti-cheat framework for the popular game CS:GO. HAWK utilizes machine learning techniques to mimic human experts' identification process, leverages novel multi-view features, and it is equipped with a well-defined workflow. The authors evaluate HAWK with the first large and real-world datasets containing multiple cheat types and cheating sophistication, and it exhibits promising efficiency and acceptable overheads, shorter ban times compared to the in-use anti-cheat, a significant reduction in manual labor, and the ability to capture cheaters who evaded official inspections.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{OPA}$: One-shot Private Aggregation with Single Client Interaction and its Applications to Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work aims to minimize interaction in secure computation due to the high cost and challenges associated with communication rounds, particularly in scenarios with many clients. In this work, we revisit the problem of secure aggregation in the single-server setting where a single evaluation server can securely aggregate client-held individual inputs. Our key contribution is the introduction of One-shot Private Aggregation ($\mathsf{OPA}$) where clients speak only once (or even choose not to speak) per aggregation evaluation. Since each client communicates only once per aggregation, this simplifies managing dropouts and dynamic participation, contrasting with multi-round protocols and aligning with plaintext secure aggregation, where clients interact only once. We construct $\mathsf{OPA}$ based on LWR, LWE, class groups, DCR and demonstrate applications to privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) where clients \emph{speak once}. This is a sharp departure from prior multi-round FL protocols whose study was initiated by Bonawitz et al. (CCS, 2017). Moreover, unlike the YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model for general secure computation, $\mathsf{OPA}$ eliminates complex committee selection protocols to achieve adaptive security. Beyond asymptotic improvements, $\mathsf{OPA}$ is practical, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. We benchmark logistic regression classifiers for two datasets, while also building an MLP classifier to train on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. We build two flavors of $\caps$ (1) from (threshold) key homomorphic PRF and (2) from seed homomorphic PRG and secret sharing.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability Coordination Under the Cyber Resilience Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) of the European Union (EU) imposes many new cyber security requirements practically to all network-enabled information technology products, whether hardware or software. The paper examines and elaborates the CRA's new requirements for vulnerability coordination, including vulnerability disclosure. Although these requirements are only a part of the CRA's obligations for vendors, also some new vulnerability coordination mandates are present. In particular, so-called actively exploited vulnerabilities require mandatory reporting. In addition to elaborating the reporting logic, the paper discusses the notion of actively exploited vulnerabilities in relation to the notion of known exploited vulnerabilities used in the United States. The CRA further alters the coordination practices on the side of public administrations. The paper addresses also these new practices. With the examination elaboration, and associated discussion based on conceptual analysis, the paper contributes to the study of cyber security regulations, providing also a few takeaways for further research.</description>

      <title>Backdooring CLIP through Concept Confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to deep learning models by allowing adversaries to implant hidden behaviors that remain dormant on clean inputs but are maliciously triggered at inference. Existing backdoor attack methods typically rely on explicit triggers such as image patches or pixel perturbations, which makes them easier to detect and limits their applicability in complex settings. To address this limitation, we take a different perspective by analyzing backdoor attacks through the lens of concept-level reasoning, drawing on insights from interpretable AI. We show that traditional attacks can be viewed as implicitly manipulating the concepts activated within a model's latent space. This motivates a natural question: can backdoors be built by directly manipulating concepts? To answer this, we propose the Concept Confusion Attack (CCA), a novel framework that designates human-understandable concepts as internal triggers, eliminating the need for explicit input modifications. By relabeling images that strongly exhibit a chosen concept and fine-tuning on this mixed dataset, CCA teaches the model to associate the concept itself with the attacker's target label. Consequently, the presence of the concept alone is sufficient to activate the backdoor, making the attack stealthier and more resistant to existing defenses. Using CLIP as a case study, we show that CCA achieves high attack success rates while preserving clean-task accuracy and evading state-of-the-art defenses.</description>

      <title>VideoMark: A Distortion-Free Robust Watermarking Framework for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces \textbf{VideoMark}, a distortion-free robust watermarking framework for video diffusion models. As diffusion models excel in generating realistic videos, reliable content attribution is increasingly critical. However, existing video watermarking methods often introduce distortion by altering the initial distribution of diffusion variables and are vulnerable to temporal attacks, such as frame deletion, due to variable video lengths. VideoMark addresses these challenges by employing a \textbf{pure pseudorandom initialization} to embed watermarks, avoiding distortion while ensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space to preserve generation quality. To enhance robustness, we adopt a frame-wise watermarking strategy with pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes, using a fixed watermark sequence with randomly selected starting indices for each video. For watermark extraction, we propose a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that leverages edit distance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence, ensuring resilience against temporal attacks. Experimental results show that VideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while maintaining video quality comparable to watermark-free generation. The watermark remains imperceptible to attackers without the secret key, offering superior invisibility compared to other frameworks. VideoMark provides a practical, training-free solution for content attribution in diffusion-based video generation. Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/KYRIE-LI11/VideoMark}{VideoMark}.</description>

      <title>DAVSP: Safety Alignment for Large Vision-Language Models via Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP), which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/DAVSP.</description>

      <title>LLMs Cannot Reliably Judge (Yet?): A Comprehensive Assessment on the Robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks, driving the development and widespread adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge systems for automated evaluation, including red teaming and benchmarking. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that can manipulate evaluation outcomes, raising critical concerns about their robustness and trustworthiness. Existing evaluation methods for LLM-based judges are often fragmented and lack a unified framework for comprehensive robustness assessment. Furthermore, the impact of prompt template design and model selection on judge robustness has rarely been explored, and their performance in real-world deployments remains largely unverified. To address these gaps, we introduce RobustJudge, a fully automated and scalable framework designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge systems. Specifically, RobustJudge investigates the effectiveness of 15 attack methods and 7 defense strategies across 12 models (RQ1), examines the impact of prompt template design and model selection (RQ2), and evaluates the security of real-world deployments (RQ3). Our study yields three key findings: (1) LLM-as-a-Judge systems are highly vulnerable to attacks such as PAIR and combined attacks, while defense mechanisms such as re-tokenization and LLM-based detectors can provide enhanced protection; (2) robustness varies substantially across prompt templates (up to 40%); (3) deploying RobustJudge on Alibaba's PAI platform uncovers previously undiscovered vulnerabilities. These results offer practical insights for building trustworthy LLM-as-a-Judge systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Parsing for Security Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security logs are foundational to threat detection and post-incident investigation, yet analysts often struggle to fully leverage them due to their heterogeneity and unstructured nature. The standard practice of manually writing parsers to normalize the data in security event management systems is time-consuming and costly due to the long tail of log formats. Meanwhile, querying raw logs without explicit parsing using large language models (LLMs) is impractical at scale. In this paper, we introduce Matryoshka, an end-to-end system leveraging LLMs to automatically generate semantically-aware structured log parsers without labeled examples or human intervention. Matryoshka achieves this by directly inferring log syntax, variable naming, and normalization to common security-specific schemas (e.g., OCSF [1]) from unlabeled log line samples, then generating deterministic parsers and mapping rules that can be efficiently applied during data ingest. This approach provides analysts with semantically-rich data representations at scale, facilitating rapid and precise log search without the traditional burden of manual parser construction. We evaluate Matryoshka's capabilities through both established template generation datasets and new datasets curated to establish end-to-end performance on a realistic distribution of log types. Our experiments show that Matryoshka outperforms prior work on syntax parsing while matching human-generated parsers in both side-by-side comparisons and retrieval for security-relevant queries. These results demonstrate that Matryoshka significantly reduces manual effort by automatically extracting and organizing valuable security data, moving us closer to fully automated, AI-driven analytics.</description>

      <title>Linearly Homomorphic Ring Signature Scheme over Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homomorphic ring signature schemes combine the strong anonymity of ring signatures with the computability of homomorphic signatures, demonstrating significant potential in scenarios requiring both anonymous data provenance and verifiable homomorphic computation (e.g., confidential blockchain transactions and secure multi-party computation). However, no feasible homomorphic ring signature scheme currently exists.
  In this work, we propose the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic ring signature scheme. Proven secure in the standard model under the small integer solution (SIS) assumption, our scheme achieves strong anonymity under full key exposure and unforgeability against insider corruption attacks. As the first unified framework for ring signatures and linear homomorphic signatures, this construction provides a post-quantum-secure solution for the aforementioned applications, advancing the development of privacy-enhanced homomorphic computation.</description>

      <title>PurpCode: Reasoning for Safer Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.</description>

      <title>LeakyCLIP: Extracting Training Data from CLIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive Language--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of multimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 258% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Whispering Agents: An event-driven covert communication protocol for the Internet of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) introduces critical challenges for communication privacy in sensitive, high-stakes domains. While standard Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer {\Pi}CCAP, a novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that {\Pi}CCAP achieves high capacity and robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens, establishing its practical viability. By systematically engineering this channel, our work provides the foundational understanding essential for developing the next generation of monitoring systems and defensive protocols for a secure and trustworthy IoA.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption for Privacy-Preserving I2I Communication in ITS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study experimentally evaluates the feasibility of post-quantum secure Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for privacy-preserving Infrastructure-to-Infrastructure (I2I) communication in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Unlike prior simulation-based efforts, this work implements three lattice-based HE schemes: Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV), and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), within a real experimental pipeline representing roadside unit (RSU)-Cloud data exchange over Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks. The experiments benchmark encrypted addition and addition-plus-multiplication operations representing key analytical tasks, such as vehicle queue assessment and regional speed computation. Results show that while BFV achieves sub-5-second latency suitable for intersection-level analytics, BGV supports regional aggregation with 10 to 30-second updates. CKKS, though exhibiting higher latency (21-32 seconds), remains practical for minute-scale applications like eco-driving. These findings demonstrate that post-quantum HE can enable privacy-preserving ITS backhaul analytics when latency requirements align with application needs. The study also presents optimization pathways, including algorithmic tuning, network adaptation, and hardware acceleration, to reduce end-to-end delay.</description>

      <title>Isolate Trigger: Detecting and Eliminating Adaptive Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely deployed in various applications but remain vulnerable to stealthy adversarial threats, particularly backdoor attacks. Backdoor models trained on poisoned datasets behave normally with clean inputs but cause mispredictions when a specific trigger is present. Most existing backdoor defenses assume that adversaries only inject one backdoor with small and conspicuous triggers. However, adaptive backdoor that entangle multiple trigger patterns with benign features can effectively bypass existing defenses. To defend against these attacks, we propose Isolate Trigger (IsTr), an accurate and efficient framework for backdoor detection and mitigation. IsTr aims to eliminate the influence of benign features and reverse hidden triggers. IsTr is motivated by the observation that a model's feature extractor focuses more on benign features while its classifier focuses more on trigger patterns. Based on this difference, IsTr designs Steps and Differential-Middle-Slice to resolve the detecting challenge of isolating triggers from benign features. Moreover, IsTr employs unlearning-based repair to remove both attacker-injected and natural backdoors while maintaining model benign accuracy. We extensively evaluate IsTr against six representative backdoor attacks and compare with seven state-of-the-art baseline methods across three real-world applications: digit recognition, face recognition, and traffic sign recognition. In most cases, IsTr reduces detection overhead by an order of magnitude while achieving over 95\% detection accuracy and maintaining the post-repair attack success rate below 3\%, outperforming baseline defenses. IsTr remains robust against various adaptive attacks, even when trigger patterns are heavily entangled with benign features.</description>

      <title>Fact2Fiction: Targeted Poisoning Attack to Agentic Fact-checking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) fact-checking systems combat misinformation by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanations for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers can amplify misinformation, but remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a novel threat model against such fact-checking systems and presents \textsc{Fact2Fiction}, the first poisoning attack framework targeting SOTA agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction employs LLMs to mimic the decomposition strategy and exploit system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than SOTA attacks across various poisoning budgets and exposes security weaknesses in existing fact-checking systems, highlighting the need for defensive countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy for Regulatory Compliance in Cyberattack Detection on Critical Infrastructure Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial control systems are a fundamental component of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as gas, water and power. With the growing risk of cyberattacks, regulatory compliance requirements are also increasing for large scale critical infrastructure systems comprising multiple utility stakeholders. The primary goal of regulators is to ensure overall system stability with recourse to trustworthy stakeholder attack detection. However, adhering to compliance requirements requires stakeholders to also disclose sensor and control data to regulators raising privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a cyberattack detection framework that utilizes differentially private (DP) hypothesis tests geared towards enhancing regulatory confidence while alleviating privacy concerns of CIN stakeholders. The hallmark of our approach is a two phase privacy scheme that protects the privacy of covariance, as well as the associated sensor driven test statistics computed as a means to generate alarms. Theoretically, we show that our method induces a misclassification error rate comparable to the non-DP cases while delivering robust privacy guarantees. With the help of real-world datasets, we show the reliability of our DP-detection outcomes for a wide variety of attack scenarios for interdependent stakeholders.</description>

      <title>SoK: Large Language Model Copyright Auditing via Fingerprinting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The broad capabilities and substantial resources required to train Large Language Models (LLMs) make them valuable intellectual property, yet they remain vulnerable to copyright infringement, such as unauthorized use and model theft. LLM fingerprinting, a non-intrusive technique that compares the distinctive features (i.e., fingerprint) of LLMs to identify whether an LLM is derived from another, offers a promising solution to copyright auditing. However, its reliability remains uncertain due to the prevalence of diverse model modifications and the lack of standardized evaluation. In this SoK, we present the first comprehensive study of the emerging LLM fingerprinting. We introduce a unified framework and taxonomy that structures the field: white-box methods are classified based on their feature source as static, forward-pass, or backward-pass fingerprinting, while black-box methods are distinguished by their query strategy as either untargeted or targeted. Furthermore, we propose LeaFBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM fingerprinting under realistic deployment scenarios. Built upon 7 mainstream foundation models and comprising 149 distinct model instances, LeaFBench integrates 13 representative post-development techniques, spanning both parameter-altering methods (e.g., fine-tuning, quantization) and parameter-independent techniques (e.g., system prompts, RAG). Extensive experiments on LeaFBench reveal the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby outlining future research directions and critical open problems in this emerging field. The code is available at https://github.com/shaoshuo-ss/LeaFBench.</description>

      <title>LLM-driven Provenance Forensics for Threat Investigation and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce PROVSEEK, an LLM-powered agentic framework for automated provenance-driven forensic analysis and threat intelligence extraction. PROVSEEK employs specialized toolchains to dynamically retrieve relevant context by generating precise, context-aware queries that fuse knowledge from threat reports with evidence from system provenance data. The framework resolves provenance queries, orchestrates multiple role-specific agents, and synthesizes structured, ground-truth verifiable forensic summaries. By combining agent orchestration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, data-guided filtration using a behavioral model, PROVSEEK enables adaptive multi-step analysis that iteratively refines hypotheses, verifies supporting evidence, and produces scalable, interpretable forensic explanations of attack behaviors. PROVSEEK is designed for automated threat investigation without task-specific training data, enabling forensic-style investigation even when no prior knowledge of the environment. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on publicly available DARPA datasets, demonstrating that PROVSEEK outperforms retrieval-based methods for the intelligence extraction task, achieving a 34% improvement in contextual precision/recall; and for threat detection task, PROVSEEK achieves 22%/29% higher precision/recall compared to both a baseline agent approach and State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Provenance-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS). In our scalability study, we show that PROVSEEK increases token usage by 1.42x and latency by 1.63x as the database size increases 50x, making it optimal for large-scale deployment. We also conducted an ablation and error analysis study to show how different components of PROVSEEK affect the detection performance.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity AI: Hacking the AI Hackers via Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how AI-powered cybersecurity tools can be turned against themselves through prompt injection attacks. Prompt injection is reminiscent of cross-site scripting (XSS): malicious text is hidden within seemingly trusted content, and when the system processes it, that text is transformed into unintended instructions. When AI agents designed to find and exploit vulnerabilities interact with malicious web servers, carefully crafted reponses can hijack their execution flow, potentially granting attackers system access. We present proof-of-concept exploits against the Cybersecurity AI (CAI) framework and its CLI tool, and detail our mitigations against such attacks in a multi-layered defense implementation. Our findings indicate that prompt injection is a recurring and systemic issue in LLM-based architectures, one that will require dedicated work to address, much as the security community has had to do with XSS in traditional web applications.</description>

      <title>SoK: How Sensor Attacks Disrupt Autonomous Vehicles: An End-to-end Analysis, Challenges, and Missed Threats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11120v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles, including self driving cars, ground robots, and drones, rely on multi-modal sensor pipelines for safe operation, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial sensor attacks. A critical gap is the lack of a systematic end-to-end view of how sensor induced errors traverse interconnected modules to affect the physical world. To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive survey across platforms, sensing modalities, attack methods, and countermeasures. At its core is \Model (\modelAbbr), a graph-based illustrative framework that maps how attacks inject errors, the conditions for their propagation through modules from perception and localization to planning and control, and when they reach physical impact. From the systematic analysis, our study distills 8 key findings that highlight the feasibility challenges of sensor attacks and uncovers 12 previously overlooked attack vectors exploiting inter-module interactions, several of which we validate through proof-of-concept experiments.</description>

      <title>NeuroStrike: Neuron-Level Attacks on Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for the ethical deployment of large language models (LLMs), guiding them to avoid generating harmful or unethical content. Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability.
  This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.</description>

      <title>Invisible Ears at Your Fingertips: Acoustic Eavesdropping via Mouse Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern optical mouse sensors, with their advanced precision and high responsiveness, possess an often overlooked vulnerability: they can be exploited for side-channel attacks. This paper introduces Mic-E-Mouse, the first-ever side-channel attack that targets high-performance optical mouse sensors to covertly eavesdrop on users. We demonstrate that audio signals can induce subtle surface vibrations detectable by a mouse's optical sensor. Remarkably, user-space software on popular operating systems can collect and broadcast this sensitive side channel, granting attackers access to raw mouse data without requiring direct system-level permissions. Initially, the vibration signals extracted from mouse data are of poor quality due to non-uniform sampling, a non-linear frequency response, and significant quantization. To overcome these limitations, Mic-E-Mouse employs a sophisticated end-to-end data filtering pipeline that combines Wiener filtering, resampling corrections, and an innovative encoder-only spectrogram neural filtering technique. We evaluate the attack's efficacy across diverse conditions, including speaking volume, mouse polling rate and DPI, surface materials, speaker languages, and environmental noise. In controlled environments, Mic-E-Mouse improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by up to +19 dB for speech reconstruction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a speech recognition accuracy of roughly 42% to 61% on the AudioMNIST and VCTK datasets.

      <title>Jailbreaking LLMs via Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs' alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs' alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs. Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro.

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Spiking Neural Networks: A Deep Dive into Encryption Parameter Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning is widely applied to modern problems through neural networks, but the growing computational and energy demands of these models have driven interest in more efficient approaches. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the third generation of neural networks, mimic the brain's event-driven behaviour, offering improved performance and reduced power use. At the same time, concerns about data privacy during cloud-based model execution have led to the adoption of cryptographic methods. This article introduces BioEncryptSNN, a spiking neural network based encryption-decryption framework for secure and noise-resilient data protection. Unlike conventional algorithms, BioEncryptSNN converts ciphertext into spike trains and exploits temporal neural dynamics to model encryption and decryption, optimising parameters such as key length, spike timing, and synaptic connectivity. Benchmarked against AES-128, RSA-2048, and DES, BioEncryptSNN preserved data integrity while achieving up to 4.1x faster encryption and decryption than PyCryptodome's AES implementation.

      <title>CompressionAttack: Exploiting Prompt Compression as a New Attack Surface in LLM-Powered Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-powered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs, but this introduces a new security risk. Compression modules, which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety, can be manipulated by adversarial inputs, causing semantic drift and altering LLM behavior. This work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents CompressionAttack, the first framework to exploit it. CompressionAttack includes two strategies: HardCom, which uses discrete adversarial edits for hard compression, and SoftCom, which performs latent-space perturbations for soft compression. Experiments on multiple LLMs show up to an average ASR of 83% and 87% in two tasks, while remaining highly stealthy and transferable. Case studies in three practical scenarios confirm real-world impact, and current defenses prove ineffective, highlighting the need for stronger protections.</description>

      <title>zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks</title>

Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>Ghost in the Transformer: Tracing LLM Lineage with SVD-Fingerprint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are widely adopted across diverse fields. Due to the substantial computational cost and data requirements of training from scratch, many developers choose to fine-tune or modify existing open-source models. While most adhere to open-source licenses, some falsely claim original training despite clear derivation from public models. This raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection and highlights the need for reliable methods to verify model provenance. In this paper, we propose GhostSpec, a lightweight yet effective method for verifying LLM lineage without access to training data or modification of model behavior. Our approach constructs compact and robust fingerprints by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to invariant products of internal attention weight matrices, effectively capturing the structural identity of a model. Unlike watermarking or output-based methods, GhostSpec is fully data-free, non-invasive, and computationally efficient. It demonstrates strong robustness to sequential fine-tuning, pruning, block expansion, and even adversarial transformations. Extensive experiments show that GhostSpec can reliably trace the lineage of transformed models with minimal overhead. By offering a practical solution for model verification and reuse tracking, our method contributes to the protection of intellectual property and fosters a transparent, trustworthy ecosystem for large-scale language models.</description>

      <title>Differentiated Directional Intervention A Framework for Evading LLM Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety alignment instills in Large Language Models (LLMs) a critical capacity to refuse malicious requests. Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.</description>

      <title>Class-feature Watermark: A Resilient Black-box Watermark Against Model Extraction Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models constitute valuable intellectual property, yet remain vulnerable to model extraction attacks (MEA), where adversaries replicate their functionality through black-box queries. Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.
  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models.</description>

      <title>Coverage-Guided Pre-Silicon Fuzzing of Open-Source Processors based on Leakage Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware-software leakage contracts have emerged as a formalism for specifying side-channel security guarantees of modern processors, yet verifying that a complex hardware design complies with its contract remains a major challenge. While verification provides strong guarantees, current verification approaches struggle to scale to industrial-sized designs. Conversely, prevalent hardware fuzzing approaches are designed to find functional correctness bugs, but are blind to information leaks like Spectre.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and scalable approach: coverage-guided hardware-software contract fuzzing. Our methodology leverages a self-compositional framework to make information leakage directly observable as microarchitectural state divergence. The core of our contribution is a new, security-oriented coverage metric, Self-Composition Deviation (SCD), which guides the fuzzer to explore execution paths that violate the leakage contract. We implemented this approach and performed an extensive evaluation on two open-source RISC-V cores: the in-order Rocket Core and the complex out-of-order BOOM core. Our results demonstrate that coverage-guided strategies outperform unguided fuzzing and that increased microarchitectural coverage leads to a faster discovery of security vulnerabilities in the BOOM core.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Privacy Leakage from Noise-Perturbed Gradients via Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning synchronizes models through gradient transmission and aggregation. However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce gradient-guided conditional diffusion models for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients, without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of the attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly emerged as a transformative approach for integrating large language models into clinical and biomedical workflows. However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems. Our evaluation reveals critical gaps, including insufficient clinical validation, absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, and lack of automated assessment tools. We propose actionable directions based on these limitations and conclude with a call to action. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in healthcare RAG and offers a roadmap toward developing systems that achieve both clinical effectiveness and robust privacy preservation.</description>

      <title>Automated Side-Channel Analysis of Cryptographic Protocol Implementations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extract the first formal model of WhatsApp from its implementation by combining binary-level analysis (via CryptoBap) with reverse engineering (via Ghidra) to handle this large closed-source application. Using this model, we prove forward secrecy, identify a known clone-attack against post-compromise security and discover functional gaps between WhatsApp's implementation and its specification. We further introduce a methodology to analyze cryptographic protocol implementations for their resilience to side-channel attacks. This is achieved by extending the CryptoBap framework to integrate hardware leakage contracts into the protocol model, which we then pass to the state-of-the-art protocol prover, DeepSec. This enables a detailed security analysis against both functional bugs and microarchitectural side-channel attacks. Using this methodology, we identify a privacy attack in WhatsApp that allows a side-channel attacker to learn the victim's contacts and confirm a known unlinkability attack on the BAC protocol used in electronic passports.
  Key contributions include (1) the first formal model of WhatsApp, extracted from its binary, (2) a framework to integrate side-channel leakage contracts into protocol models for the first time, and (3) revealing critical vulnerabilities invisible to specification-based methods.</description>

      <title>Private Frequency Estimation Via Residue Number Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present \textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \in [\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \textsf{SubsetSelection} (SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $\Theta\bigl(\omega \log_2(k/\omega)\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $\omega \approx k/(e^\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\lceil \log_2 \ell \rceil + \lceil \log_2 m_j \rceil$ bits, where $m_j &lt; k$. Server-side decoding runs in $\Theta(n + r k \ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\ell = \Theta(\log k)$), this becomes $\Theta(n + k \log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022) while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS. Lastly, by sampling from multiple moduli and reporting only a single perturbed residue, MSS achieves the lowest reconstruction-attack success rate among all evaluated LDP protocols.</description>

      <title>DiffProtect: Generate Adversarial Examples with Diffusion Models for Facial Privacy Protection</title>

Abstract: The increasingly pervasive facial recognition (FR) systems raise serious concerns about personal privacy, especially for billions of users who have publicly shared their photos on social media. Several attempts have been made to protect individuals from being identified by unauthorized FR systems utilizing adversarial attacks to generate encrypted face images. However, existing methods suffer from poor visual quality or low attack success rates, which limit their utility. Recently, diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation. In this work, we ask: can diffusion models be used to generate adversarial examples to improve both visual quality and attack performance? We propose DiffProtect, which utilizes a diffusion autoencoder to generate semantically meaningful perturbations on FR systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffProtect produces more natural-looking encrypted images than state-of-the-art methods while achieving significantly higher attack success rates, e.g., 24.5% and 25.1% absolute improvements on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets.</description>

      <title>Mysticeti: Reaching the Limits of Latency with Uncertified DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14821v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Mysticeti-C, the first DAG-based Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve the lower bounds of latency of 3 message rounds. Since Mysticeti-C is built over DAGs it also achieves high resource efficiency and censorship resistance. Mysticeti-C achieves this latency improvement by avoiding explicit certification of the DAG blocks and by proposing a novel commit rule such that every block can be committed without delays, resulting in optimal latency in the steady state and under crash failures. We further extend Mysticeti-C to Mysticeti-FPC, which incorporates a fast commit path that achieves even lower latency for transferring assets. Unlike prior fast commit path protocols, Mysticeti-FPC minimizes the number of signatures and messages by weaving the fast path transactions into the DAG. This frees up resources, which subsequently result in better performance. We prove the safety and liveness in a Byzantine context. We evaluate both Mysticeti protocols and compare them with state-of-the-art consensus and fast path protocols to demonstrate their low latency and resource efficiency, as well as their more graceful degradation under crash failures. Mysticeti-C is the first Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve WAN latency of 0.5s for consensus commit while simultaneously maintaining state-of-the-art throughput of over 200k TPS. Finally, we report on integrating Mysticeti-C as the consensus protocol into the Sui blockchain, resulting in over 4x latency reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networked computing power is a critical utility in the era of artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel Physical Infrastructure Finance (PinFi) protocol designed to facilitate the distribution of computing power within networks in a decentralized manner. Addressing the core challenges of coordination, pricing, and liquidity in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), the PinFi protocol introduces a distinctive dynamic pricing mechanism. It enables providers to allocate excess computing resources to a "dissipative" PinFi liquidity pool, distinct from traditional DeFi liquidity pools, ensuring seamless access for clients at equitable, market-based prices. This approach significantly reduces the costs of accessing computing power, potentially to as low as 1% compared to existing services, while simultaneously enhancing security and dependability. The PinFi protocol is poised to transform the dynamics of supply and demand in computing power networks, setting a new standard for efficiency and accessibility.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Ethereum Blob Revolution: Market, Strategies, and Optimality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a key enabler of Web3, Ethereum has long faced scalability challenges. The recent EIP-4844 upgrade aims to alleviate the scalability issue by introducing the ''blob'', a new data structure for Layer-2 rollups that enables off-chain storage with much reduced costs. Yet, this new mechanism's impact on Ethereum, and the wider Web3 ecosystem, remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of the post-EIP-4844 ecosystem, leveraging a dataset of 319.5 million transactions, out of which 1.3 million are blob-carrying. Our analysis reveals two major trends: (1) average block size has increased 2.5 times, from 150 KB to 400 KB, while the share of conventional transactions has shrunk from over $150$ KB to around 80 KB; (2) rollups are rapidly migrating from expensive calldata, falling from approximately 7,500 to nearly zero, toward cheap blobs, rising from zero to about 10,000. These shifts introduce a new economic game between block builders and rollups. Thus, we develop a game-theoretic model to characterize their equilibrium strategies: a profit-maximizing inclusion rule for builders, and a cost-minimizing blob batching strategy for rollups. Empirically, however, we find notable economic inefficiencies: for example, 29.48% of blob-containing blocks are built sub-optimally, yielding less revenue than available alternatives. These findings highlight the intricacies of the blob marketplace, and our work has established both methodological and empirical foundations to understand the evolving post-EIP4844 Ethereum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Shuffle Differential Privacy</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for sequential decision-making, but its application is often hindered by privacy concerns arising from its interaction data. This challenge is particularly acute in advanced networked systems, where learning from operational and user data can expose systems to privacy inference attacks. Existing differential privacy (DP) models for RL are often inadequate: the centralized model requires a fully trusted server, creating a single point of failure risk, while the local model incurs significant performance degradation that is unsuitable for many networked applications. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the emerging shuffle model of privacy, an intermediate trust model that provides strong privacy guarantees without a centralized trust assumption. We present Shuffle Differentially Private Policy Elimination (SDP-PE), the first generic policy elimination-based algorithm for episodic RL under the shuffle model. Our method introduces a novel exponential batching schedule and a ``forgetting'' mechanism to balance the competing demands of privacy and learning performance. Our analysis shows that SDP-PE achieves a near-optimal regret bound, demonstrating a superior privacy-regret trade-off with utility comparable to the centralized model while significantly outperforming the local model. The numerical experiments also corroborate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of SDP-PE. This work establishes the viability of the shuffle model for secure data-driven decision-making in networked systems.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Generation of Adversarial Texts: A Case Study on Tibetan Script</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12478v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNN-based language models excel across various NLP tasks but remain highly vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks. While adversarial text generation is crucial for NLP security, explainability, evaluation, and data augmentation, related work remains overwhelmingly English-centric, leaving the problem of constructing high-quality and sustainable adversarial robustness benchmarks for lower-resourced languages both difficult and understudied. First, method customization for lower-resourced languages is complicated due to linguistic differences and limited resources. Second, automated attacks are prone to generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial texts. Last but not least, language models continuously evolve and may be immune to parts of previously generated adversarial texts. To address these challenges, we introduce HITL-GAT, an interactive system based on a general approach to human-in-the-loop generation of adversarial texts. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of HITL-GAT through a case study on Tibetan script, employing three customized adversarial text generation methods and establishing its first adversarial robustness benchmark, providing a valuable reference for other lower-resourced languages.</description>

      <title>Transferability of Adversarial Attacks in Video-based MLLMs: A Cross-modal Image-to-Video Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models - a common and practical real-world scenario - remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal large language model (I-MLLM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and spatiotemporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. Additionally, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as a surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rate (AASR) of 57.98% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for Zero-Shot VideoQA tasks, respectively.</description>

      <title>MOS-Attack: A Scalable Multi-objective Adversarial Attack Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crafting adversarial examples is crucial for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), presenting a challenge equivalent to maximizing a non-differentiable 0-1 loss function.
  However, existing single objective methods, namely adversarial attacks focus on a surrogate loss function, do not fully harness the benefits of engaging multiple loss functions, as a result of insufficient understanding of their synergistic and conflicting nature.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose the Multi-Objective Set-based Attack (MOS Attack), a novel adversarial attack framework leveraging multiple loss functions and automatically uncovering their interrelations.
  The MOS Attack adopts a set-based multi-objective optimization strategy, enabling the incorporation of numerous loss functions without additional parameters.
  It also automatically mines synergistic patterns among various losses, facilitating the generation of potent adversarial attacks with fewer objectives.
  Extensive experiments have shown that our MOS Attack outperforms single-objective attacks. Furthermore, by harnessing the identified synergistic patterns, MOS Attack continues to show superior results with a reduced number of loss functions. Our code is available at https://github.com/pgg3/MOS-Attack.</description>

      <title>An Improved Privacy and Utility Analysis of Differentially Private SGD with Bounded Domain and Smooth Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its privacy guarantee often comes at a large cost of model performance due to the lack of tight theoretical bounds quantifying privacy loss. While recent efforts have achieved more accurate privacy guarantees, they still impose some assumptions prohibited from practical applications, such as convexity and complex parameter requirements, and rarely investigate in-depth the impact of privacy mechanisms on the model's utility. In this paper, we provide a rigorous privacy characterization for DPSGD with general L-smooth and non-convex loss functions, revealing converged privacy loss with iteration in bounded-domain cases. Specifically, we track the privacy loss over multiple iterations, leveraging the noisy smooth-reduction property, and further establish comprehensive convergence analysis in different scenarios. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i) the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, (ii) a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously under certain conditions, and (iii) the attainable big-O order of the privacy utility trade-off for DPSGD with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC) and for DPSGD-GC with bounded domain (DPSGD-DC) and mu-strongly convex population risk function, respectively. Experiments via membership inference attack (MIA) in a practical setting validate insights gained from the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>SafeKey: Amplifying Aha-Moment Insights for Safety Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce a new generation paradigm of explicitly reasoning before answering, leading to remarkable improvements in complex tasks. However, they pose great safety risks against harmful queries and adversarial attacks. While recent mainstream safety efforts on LRMs, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improve safety performance, we find that SFT-aligned models struggle to generalize to unseen jailbreak prompts. After thorough investigation of LRMs' generation, we identify a safety aha moment that can activate safety reasoning and lead to a safe response. This aha moment typically appears in the `key sentence', which follows models' query understanding process and can indicate whether the model will proceed safely. Based on these insights, we propose SafeKey, including two complementary objectives to better activate the safety aha moment in the key sentence: (1) a Dual-Path Safety Head to enhance the safety signal in the model's internal representations before the key sentence, and (2) a Query-Mask Modeling objective to improve the models' attention on its query understanding, which has important safety hints. Experiments across multiple safety benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve safety generalization to a wide range of jailbreak attacks and out-of-distribution harmful prompts, lowering the average harmfulness rate by 9.6\%, while maintaining general abilities. Our analysis reveals how SafeKey enhances safety by reshaping internal attention and improving the quality of hidden representations.</description>

      <title>Video Signature: Implicit Watermarking for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has led to significant progress in video generation, but also raises serious concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing. Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, yet existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. Meanwhile, current in-generation methods that embed the watermark into the initial Gaussian noise usually incur substantial additional computation. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Video Signature} (\textsc{VidSig}), an implicit watermarking method for video diffusion models that enables imperceptible and adaptive watermark integration during video generation with almost no extra latency. Specifically, we partially fine-tune the latent decoder, where \textbf{Perturbation-Aware Suppression} (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight \textbf{Temporal Alignment} module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that \textsc{VidSig} achieves the best trade-off among watermark extraction accuracy, video quality, and watermark latency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tamper, and remains stable across different video lengths and resolutions, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Private Evolution Converges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework to understand PE's practical behavior and identify sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive datasets with $n$ data points from a convex and compact domain, we prove that under the right hyperparameter settings and given access to the Gaussian variation API proposed in \cite{PE23}, PE produces an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein distance $\tilde{O}(d(n\varepsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original; this establishes worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our theoretical findings in experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning of Graph Representations for Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</description>

      <title>HiLoMix: Robust High- and Low-Frequency Graph Learning Framework for Mixing Address Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As mixing services are increasingly being exploited by malicious actors for illicit transactions, mixing address association has emerged as a critical research task. A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels. Then, we jointly train high-pass and low-pass GNNs using both unsupervised contrastive signals and confidence-based supervision to learn robust node representations. Finally, we adopt a stacking framework to fuse predictions from multiple heterogeneous models, further improving generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLoMix outperforms existing methods in mixing address association.</description>
