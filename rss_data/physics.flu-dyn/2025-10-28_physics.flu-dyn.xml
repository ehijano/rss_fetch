      <title>Numerical Insights on Controlled Droplet Formation in a Microfluidic Flow-Focusing Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we have developed a computational model to determine the droplet formation regime and its transition in a square microfluidic flow-focusing device that eventually dictate the droplet shape, size, and its formation frequency. We have methodically explored the influences of various physicochemical parameters on the droplet dynamics and flow regime transition, which are essential in the development of new methods for on-demand droplet generation. On the basis of the droplet formation mechanism, we have formulated flow maps for different liquid-liquid systems, and have also proposed a scaling law to predict the droplet length for a wide range of operating condition resulting from the variation of flow rates, and viscosities of the continuous phase as well as the interfacial tension. This work can effectively contribute in providing helpful guidelines on the design and operations of droplet-based flow-focusing microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phenomenon of bouncing of inertial particles crossing density stratified interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of inertial spheres settling through density-stratified interfaces, focusing on the conditions that lead to pronounced deceleration and ``bouncing''. Using synchronized particle tracking and flow visualization in both water-salt and water-glycerol stratifications, we extend the parameter space of previous studies to include significant viscosity contrasts. We show that existing models based solely on density ratios fail to capture the observed retention times and bouncing behavior. Instead, we identify the ratio of particle Froude numbers across the interface, $Fr_2/Fr_1 \le 0.142$, as the critical condition distinguishing bouncing from non-bouncing cases. Using a drag-law of the form $C_d = \alpha Re^{-\beta}$, this ratio can be expressed in terms of density and viscosity contrasts. The results reveal how inertia, viscosity, and stratification jointly control particle retention, with implications for sedimentation, separation, and biogeophysical transport processes.</description>

      <title>Electrokinetic Effects on Flow and Ion Transport in Charge-Patterned Corrugated Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how the distribution of surface charge along corrugated nanochannels affects flow rates and influences ionic currents and charge selectivity in a pressure gradient-driven flow. We numerically solve the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes (PNPS) equations for periodic aperture profiles and explore how changes in the Debye screening length and the degree of symmetry between surface charge and geometry, and the magnitude of an applied pressure gradient affect the velocity profile. We identify three regimes of flow: I. At low (no) pressure gradients, the inhomogeneous distribution of surface charge generates a nonlinear torque that drives recirculating flow. Placing surface charge asymmetrically with respect to the geometry produces a net axial flow. II. At moderate pressure gradients, the flow rate is proportional to the mechanical driving force, though is significantly diminished relative to channels absent of surface charge inhomogeneity. Throughput is inhibited by the electrostatic force that opposes the displacement of ions from the diffuse part of the electric double layer. III. At high pressure gradients, we demonstrate a transition between electrostatically and mechanically controlled flow regimes, where -- under appropriate choice of parameters -- a marginal increase in the applied pressure gradient triggers an abrupt, orders-of-magnitude increase in the mean velocity. By incorporating the computed velocity and electric fields from the PNPS equations into a random walk particle tracking algorithm, we provide a detailed quantitative characterization of the transport dynamics of the ions, demonstrating the ability to selectively control the flux of charge and moderate the rate of ion dispersion.</description>

      <title>Aeroelastic Reduced-Order Model Differential Equations in Transonic Buffeting Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of the transonic shock buffet phenomenon remains a formidable challenge due to its inherent nonlinear and unsteady characteristics. These difficulties are further compounded in three-dimensional configurations and when aeroelastic coupling is considered. Consequently, computational studies of aeroelastic shock buffet interactions have largely been confined to two-dimensional systems. This limitation underscores the need for reduced-order models (ROMs) capable of efficiently and accurately capturing the aeroelastic response of structures subjected to shock buffet oscillations. This paper presents a novel nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic ROM that integrates nonlinear oscillator dynamics with Volterra theory to model aeroelastic shock buffet phenomena. The coefficients and terms of the resulting Integro-Differential Equation ROM (IDE-ROM) are identified using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Application of the IDE-ROM to an OAT15A airfoil demonstrates that the compact and computationally efficient formulation can reproduce key nonlinear behaviors, including aeroelastic lock-in, with a high degree of accuracy. The limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach are also critically examined.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer transition induced by surface roughness distributed over a low-pressure turbine blade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of a low-pressure turbine with roughness elements distributed over the blade surface have been performed. A series of fifteen cases with varying roughness heights and streamwise wavenumbers are introduced to present a systematic study of the effect of roughness on the various transition phenomena in the suction-side boundary layer. For cases with large roughness heights, the boundary layer is violently disturbed by the wake of rough elements in the leading edge (LE) region, and maintains the turbulent state over the whole blade suction-side. For cases with small roughness heights, however, the disturbances induced by the LE roughness are suppressed by the favourable pressure gradient in the downstream boundary layer, and the relaminarized flow does not undergo transition until the separation near the blade trailing edge (TE). Furthermore, the streamwise wavenumber of the distributed roughness plays an important role in cases with intermediate roughness height. Specifically, cases with larger streamwise slope show earlier transition induced by strong shear layer instability, which manages to suppress the mean flow separation near the TE region. Overall, the combined effect of several factors, including the geometric effect at the blade LE and TE, the complex pressure gradient distribution across the turbine vane, and the various roughness configurations, is responsible for the intriguing boundary layer behaviours in the present study.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in the dissipation in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence of the hysteretic nature of dissipation in unsteady turbulent flows. Wind tunnel experiments and direct numerical simulations in oscillating flows show that, at fixed mean Reynolds number, the dissipation constant is larger for decelerating flows. Consequently, a periodic behavior of the flow produces a hysteresis cycle, whose area scales with a parameter combining the Strouhal number and the relative amplitude of the forcing. This phenomenon can be explained and quantified through the influence of the unsteady term in the Karman-Howarth equation, with implications for a wide range of out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Augmentation of Turbulence Model in Three-dimensional Flows Via Sequential Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic turbulence models often struggle to accurately predict complex flows that involve phenomena such as flow separation. Although data-driven techniques have emerged to address these shortcomings by augmenting classical models with correction terms, most existing research has concentrated on two-dimensional (2D) cases. Therefore, the performance of these corrected models in complex three-dimensional (3D) flows remains an underexplored area. This study addresses this gap by enhancing a data-driven turbulence model, the SST-CND (shear stress transport-conditioned) model, which was originally trained on 2D separated flows. An additional correction term, \b{eta}_3D, is introduced to account for 3D effects. The distribution of this term is initially determined through a 3D field inversion process using high-fidelity data obtained from the flow around a cube. An explicit algebraic expression for \b{eta}_3D is then derived through symbolic regression and formulated to degrade to zero in 2D cases. This new expression is integrated into the original model, resulting in the SST-CND3D model. The performance of the SST-CND3D model is evaluated across a range of flows. In 2D flows, including the separated flow around a hump, flow over a flat plate, and flow around a multi-element airfoil, the SST-CND3D model performs identically to its 2D-trained predecessor. However, the model exhibits superior performance in 3D flows, such as the flow around a cube and the complex, real-world JAXA standard model high-lift configuration. These findings indicate that a sequential correction approach, constructing a 3D correction term that vanishes in 2D on top of a 2D-trained model, constitutes a promising method for developing data-driven turbulence models that maintain accuracy in 3D while preserving their effectiveness in 2D.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Discontinuous Ice Effects on Swept Wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance and flow structures of infinite swept wings with artificially simulated discontinuous ice using an enhanced delayed detached-eddy simulation. Comparisons are made among clean, continuous-ice, and discontinuous-ice configurations. Results show that discontinuous ice causes a more severe reduction in lift than continuous ice. While continuous ice forms a large separation bubble that helps maintain lift, discontinuous ice disrupts leading-edge vortex formation through gap jets, resulting in greater lift loss but a smaller drag penalty. Unlike the continuous-ice wing, the discontinuous-ice case does not exhibit a sudden stall-induced lift drop. The flow over the discontinuous-ice wing can be characterized by two canonical patterns: a separating shear layer and K\'arm\'an vortex shedding. However, the separating shear layer becomes irregular due to the interference of gap jets. Three characteristic chord-based Strouhal numbers (St)-11.3, 22.6, and 33.9-are identified. The lowest (St=11.3) corresponds to the shedding of vortex pairs; when nondimensionalized by the ice width, it yields St = 0.58, which is higher than that of a canonical cylinder wake. Furthermore, lift and drag fluctuations occur predominantly at St = 22.6, twice the shedding frequency, primarily induced by the gap jets-a phenomenon absent in the continuous-ice case.</description>

      <title>A Unified Numerical Framework for Turbulent Convection and Phase-Change Dynamics in Coupled Fluid-Porous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified numerical framework for simulating turbulent thermal convection and phase-change dynamics in coupled fluid-porous media systems. The framework is designed to handle high solid-to-fluid thermal conductivity contrast and spatiotemporally varying porosity. It combines a Darcy-Brinkman formulation with a modified phase-field method to achieve smooth two-way coupling across transitioning interfaces. The model integrates momentum, energy, solute transport, and phase evolution equations. A factorized operator-splitting approach with second-order temporal accuracy is employed to ensure computational efficiency. The numerical method is rigorously validated using a range of benchmark problems. These include channel flow over permeable substrates, thermal convection in porous-fluid layers, 1D Stefan and 2D pure-water phase changing, double-diffusive convection in porous media, and seawater solidification. The results show good agreement with existing experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Gauss Principle in Incompressible Flow: Unified Variational Perspective on Pressure and Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following recent work (Gonzalez and Taha 2022; Peters and Ormiston 2025), this manuscript clarifies what the Gauss-Appell principle determines in incompressible, inviscid flow and how it connects to classical projection methods. At a fixed time, freezing the velocity and varying only the material acceleration leads to minimization of a quadratic subject to acceleration-level constraints. First-order conditions yield a Poisson-Neumann problem for a reaction pressure whose gradient removes the non-solenoidal and wall-normal content of the provisional residual, i.e. the Leray-Hodge projection. Thus, Gauss-Appell enforces the instantaneous kinematic constraints and recovers Euler at the instant. In steady flows, this principle cannot select circulation or stagnation points because these are properties of the velocity state, not the instantaneous acceleration correction. The principle only determines the reaction pressure for an already-specified velocity field. The impressed/reaction pressure decomposition can be supplemented with orthogonality conditions, allowing physical inputs (e.g. circulation, freestream) to be embedded while maintaining exact constraint enforcement. This variational viewpoint provides a diagnostic for computational incompatibility: In a practical computation, spikes in projection effort may signal problematic boundary conditions or under-resolution, and clarifies how pressure instantaneously maintains solenoidality without creating or destroying vorticity. The goal of this note is simply to lend more clarity to the application of the Gauss principle, and to connect it concretely to well known concepts including potential flow theory, projection algorithms, and recent variational approaches.</description>

      <title>A parametric study of the broadband shock-associated noise in supersonic jets via semi-empirical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-empirical model is developed in this paper to predict the broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) generated by shock-instability interaction (SII) in imperfectly expanded supersonic jets. The model makes use of a semi-empirically modified Pack's model that accounts for the decay in both shock amplitude and shock spacing and a Gaussian wave-packet model for the instability waves. The near-field pressure perturbation due to the SII is treated as a boundary value for the Helmholtz equation, which is subsequently solved to predict the far-field acoustic spectra and directivity patterns. A comprehensive parametric study is conducted to reveal the effects of the key parameters on the acoustic spectral and directivity features. It is found that decreasing the instability-wave decay rate narrows the spectral bandwidth and the major lobes in directivity patterns, while variations in shock spacing shift the spectral peak frequency and the major radiation angle. Mechanisms of such changes are discussed based on the model. Further validation against multiple experimental datasets demonstrates that incorporating more realistic parameters in the model-particularly those accounting for the shock spacing and amplitude decays-considerably improves its prediction accuracy and physical consistency. The improved model successfully reproduces several key spectral features observed in experiments; these include, for example, the peak frequency and the tendency of bandwidth contradiction as the observer angle increases. Moreover, the predicted directivity patterns closely match the experiments outside the shallow-angle region dominated by jet mixing noise. In particular, it captures the major radiation lobes and their frequency-dependent amplitude and shape variations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of accuracy and efficiency of neural networks to simulate Navier-Stokes fluid flows with obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional fluid simulations can be time consuming and energy intensive. We researched the viability of a neural network for simulating incompressible fluids in a randomized obstacle-heavy environment, as an alternative to the numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation. We hypothesized that the neural network predictions would have a relatively low error for simulations over a small number of time steps, but errors would eventually accumulate to the point that the output would become very noisy. Over a rich set of obstacle configurations, we achieved a root mean square error of 0.32% on our training dataset and 0.36% on a testing dataset. These errors only grew to 1.45% and 2.34% at t = 10 and, 2.11% and 4.16% at timestep t = 20. We also found that our selected neural network was approximately 8,800 times faster at predicting the flow than a conventional simulation. Our findings indicate neural networks can be extremely useful at simulating fluids in obstacle-heavy environments. Useful applications include modeling forest fire smoke, pipe fluid flow, and underwater/flood currents.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations, Clustering, and Interaction-Driven Dynamics in Sedimenting Particles at Low Galileo Numbers: A Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behaviour of sedimenting solid particles and the influence of microscopic particle dynamics on the collective motion of a sedimenting cloud. Departing from conventional direct numerical simulations (DNS), we introduce a novel machine learning framework, the Interaction-Decomposed Neural Network (IDNN), to model hydrodynamic particle interactions. The IDNN acts as a black-box module within a Lagrangian solver, predicting the particle drag force based on the relative positions of the nearest neighbours. This enables the recovery of force fluctuations, capturing effects previously accessible only through DNS. Our results show an increase in collective settling velocity in the dilute regime, consistent with earlier experimental and numerical studies, which we attribute to (i) fluctuations in the streamwise particle force around a value that is lower than the Stokes limit and (ii) the formation of particle clusters sedimenting at enhanced velocities. These fluctuations originate from persistent entrainment and ejection of particles in and out of the long, diffusive wakes generated by upstream particles at low Galileo numbers. Energy spectra of particle velocity fluctuations reveal a scale-dependent transfer of fluctuation energy, analogous to a turbulent-like cascade, with pronounced large-scale fluctuations at higher volume fractions. At very low volume fractions, fluctuation intensity and energy spectrum amplitudes diminish, though hydrodynamic interactions still remain appreciable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical description of the fluid--structure interaction observed within a Starling resistor. The typical setup consists of a pre-stretched finite length thin-walled elastic tube mounted between two rigid tubes. The collapsible section is enclosed within a pressure chamber and a viscous fluid is driven through the system by imposing an axial volume flux at the downstream end. Valid within a long-wavelength thin-walled regime, we use our own results to model the wall mechanics. These results arise from the solution of a generalised eigenvalue problem, and avoid the need to invoke the ad-hoc approximations made in previous studies. The wall mechanics are then coupled to the fluid mechanics using the Navier--Stokes equations, under the assumption that the oscillations in the tube wall are of small amplitude, long wavelength and high frequency. We derive problems governing the leading-order steady and oscillatory fluid-structure interaction. At leading order, the system permits normal-mode oscillations of constant frequency and amplitude, which are obtained in the form of series solutions. Higher-order corrections govern the slow growth or decay of the oscillations, however (as in previous work) these growth rates can be determined by analysing the system's global energy budget without needing to compute the higher-order terms explicitly. Our results permit the first formal analysis of the errors incurred by neglecting contributions from higher-order azimuthal modes, and enable the determination of improved criterion for the onset of self-excited oscillations in the tube wall.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hematocrit-Plasma Separation in a Trifurcated Microchannel by a Diffusive Flux Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platelet-enriched plasma and red blood cells (RBC) are needed in the treatment of blood-related diseases, including anaemia and blood cancer. These essential components must be separated from blood in well-designed experimental setups. If active techniques are used, the blood components are likely to be damaged or contaminated while handling. Passive techniques for component separation are preferred, and their design for effectiveness before manufacturing is the subject of this article. Specifically, the performance of a design consisting of a trifurcated microchannel is examined in the framework of 3D numerical simulation, following similar design ideas in recent experimental studies. The influence of geometrical parameters of the channel, such as width and separation arm angle, inlet extension, flow constriction, and flow parameters, including flow rates, hematocrit concentration, and temperature, is studied. The present study utilizes the diffusive flux model (DFM) to model the shear-driven migration of red blood cells (RBC) in a microchannel along with an appropriate rheology model. The physical mechanism driving separation is the formation of the cell-free layer near the walls, using which the separation efficiency and device effectiveness are quantified. It is found that a microchannel with a smaller width and an extended inlet, along with diluted blood samples of lower hematocrit, is effective for greater separation, while the device performance is less sensitive to the flow rates, flow constriction, and the separator angle.</description>

      <title>On the choking mechanism in supersonic ejectors: a one-dimensional analysis of Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ejectors are passive devices used in refrigeration, propulsion, and process industries to compress a secondary stream without moving parts. The engineering modeling of choking in these devices remains an open question, with two mechanisms-Fabri and compound choking-proposed in the literature. This work develops a unified one-dimensional framework that implements both mechanisms and compares them with axisymmetric Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) data processed by cross-sectional averaging. The compound formulation incorporates wall and inter-stream friction and a local pressure-equalization procedure that enables stable integration through the sonic point, together with a normal shock reconstruction. The Fabri formulation is assessed by imposing the dividing streamline extracted from RANS, isolating the sonic condition while avoiding additional modeling assumptions. The calibrated compound model predicts on-design secondary mass flow typically within 2 % with respect to the RANS simulations, rising to 5 % for a strongly under-expanded primary jet due to the equal-pressure constraint. The Fabri analysis attains less than 1 % error in on-design entrainment but exhibits high sensitivity to the dividing streamline and closure, which limits predictive use beyond on-design. Overall, the results show that Fabri and compound mechanisms can coexist within the same device and operating map, each capturing distinct aspects of the physics and offering complementary modeling value. Nevertheless, compound choking emerges as the more general mechanism governing flow rate blockage, as evidenced by choked flows with a subsonic secondary stream.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Imagery Analysis of Droplet Impact on Van der Waals and Non-Van der Waals Soft-Textured Oil-Infused Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of surface functionalization, oil coating, and oil absorption on droplet impact behavior on textured polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) substrates. The textured surfaces were fabricated with square micro-posts having spacings of 5 and 20 microns. The PDMS samples were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to improve water repellency. Following, the surfaces were either coated with or allowed to absorb two different lubricants, silicone oil (SO-5cSt) and hexadecane. We performed detailed wetting measurements on both untreated and OTS-functionalized substrates. These measurements provided useful insights into how water and lubricants were retained and distributed under static conditions. High-speed imaging was used to capture droplet impact across a range of Weber numbers. On SO-5cSt-absorbed substrates, droplets consistently showed complete rebound at all Weber numbers, regardless of post spacing. This robust rebound was attributed to the oil's ability to fill the gaps between the posts through capillary action, while also forming a stable lubricating layer above the texture. This thin oil film reduced friction between the droplet and the surface, enabling the droplet to retain sufficient energy for complete rebound. In contrast, hexadecane-absorbed substrates displayed different dynamics. At low Weber numbers, only partial rebound was observed, while at intermediate values, droplets rebounded completely. However, droplets no longer rebounded at higher Weber numbers and remained deposited. Repeated droplet impacts further demonstrated that hexadecane-infused surfaces gradually lost oil from the textured gaps, resulting in a decline in rebound performance over time. This effect was not observed with SO-5cSt, underscoring the importance of lubricant affinity and stability.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic mesh adaptation for unsteady two-phase flow simulation with the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an anisotropic mesh adaptation procedure based on Riemannian metrics for the simulation of two-phase incompressible flows with non-matching densities. The system dynamics are governed by the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations, discretized with mixed finite elements and implicit time-stepping. Spatial accuracy is controlled throughout the simulation by the \emph{global transient fixed-point method} from Alauzet \emph{et al.}, in which the simulation time is divided into sub-intervals, each associated with an adapted anisotropic mesh. The simulation is run in a fixed-point loop until convergence of each mesh--solution pair. Each iteration takes advantage of the previously computed solution and accurately predicts the flow variations. This ensures that the mesh always captures the fluid-fluid interface, and allows for a dynamic control of the interface thickness at a fraction of the computational cost compared to uniform or isotropic grids. Moreover, using a modest number of time sub-intervals reduces the transfer error from one mesh to another, which would otherwise eventually spoil the numerical solution. The overall adaptive procedure is verified with manufactured solutions and the well-known rising bubble benchmark.</description>

      <title>Study of the Molecular Level Mechanism of Nanoscale Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular-level mechanism of Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic (AC-EHD) flow in nanopores under high-frequency conditions, using molecular dynamics simulations. A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under high-frequency AC potentials. Our findings reveal localized heat generation near the electrode leading to a steep temperature gradient. An order parameter analysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in the alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high frequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat generation and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC frequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the size and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in the asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed by analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order parameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements. Different forces acting on the fluid were identified such as buoyancy-driven convection due to temperature gradient, electrothermal effects influenced by the temperature-dependent properties of water, and Maxwell stress due to the non-uniform electric field. Moreover, the asymmetric electrode structure created an imbalance in these forces and generated a net directional flow. These findings suggest the existence of a form of nanoscale AC-EHD flow that operates in a frequency regime above that of conventional electroosmotic and electrothermal mechanisms and that, unlike these mechanisms, occurs independently of ionic concentration. Thereby this work provides insights for optimizing AC-EHD flow in nanoscale systems where precise fluid manipulation is critical.</description>

      <title>Residual-guided AI-CFD hybrid method enables stable and scalable simulations: from 2D benchmarks to 3D applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning (ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable, accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in real-world engineering.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Deep Learning and Analysis of Dynamical Systems via the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal swimming in granular media: the role of jamming and swimmer inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use particle simulations to reveal two distinct propulsion mechanisms for a scallop-like swimmer to locomote itself in granular media by reciprocally flapping its wings. Based on the discrete element method, we examine the kinematics and contact forces of particles near the swimmer to identify jamming effects induced by the swimmer in a frictional granular medium, which are less intense during the opening stroke than the closing. This broken symmetry is quantified by the difference in the number of strong particle contact forces formed during opening and closing, which shows a linear relation with the swimmer's net displacement across various swimmer and medium configurations, all favoring the opening stroke. We identify a secondary propulsion mechanism in a dynamic regime with significant swimmer inertia, as the flapping period approaches the coasting time for a moving swimmer to come to rest under the medium resistance. In this case, the swimmer's net displacement is correlated to the ratio between these two time scales, and the swimming direction favors the closing stroke due to the smaller medium resistance as the swimmer coasts with closed wings.</description>

      <title>Fast integration method for averaging polydisperse bubble population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble-averaged polydisperse bubbly flow models require statistical moments of the evolving bubble size distribution. Under step forcing, these moments reach statistical equilibrium in finite time. However, the transitional phase before equilibrium and cases with time-dependent forcing are required to predict flow in engineering applications. Computing these moments is expensive because the integrands are highly oscillatory, even when the bubble dynamics are linear. Ensemble-averaged models compute these moments at each grid point and time step, making cost reduction important for large-scale bubbly flow simulations. Traditional methods evaluate the integrals via traditional quadrature rules. This approach requires a large number of quadrature nodes in the equilibrium bubble size, each equipped with its own advection partial differential equation (PDE), resulting in significant computational expense. We formulate a Levin collocation method to reduce this cost. Given the differential equation associated with the integrand, or moment, the method approximates it by evaluating its derivative via polynomial collocation. The differential matrix and amplitude function are well-suited to numerical differentiation via collocation, and so the computation is comparatively cheap. For an example excited polydisperse bubble population, the first moment is computed with the presented method at $10^{-3}$ relative error with 100 times fewer quadrature nodes than the trapezoidal rule. The gap increases for smaller target relative errors: the Levin method requires $10^4$ times fewer points for a relative error of $10^{-8}$. The formulated method maintains constant cost as the integrands become more oscillatory with time, making it particularly attractive for long-time simulations.</description>

      <title>The influence of a stably stratified layer on the hydromagnetic waves in the Earth's core and their electromagnetic torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence from seismic studies, mineral physics, thermal evolution models and geomagnetic observations is inconclusive about the presence of a stably stratified layer at the top of the Earth's fluid outer core. Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfv\'en waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric derivation of the quasi-geostrophic equations on the sphere, starting from the rotating shallow water equations. We utilise perturbation series methods in vorticity and divergence variables. The derivation employs asymptotic analysis techniques, leading to a global quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity model on the sphere without approximation of the Coriolis parameter. The resulting model forms a closed system for the evolution of potential vorticity with a rich mathematical structure, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions. Formulated using the Lie-Poisson bracket reveals the geometric invariants of the quasi-geostrophic model. Motivated by these geometric results, simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow on the sphere are presented based on structure-preserving Lie-Poisson time-integration. We explicitly demonstrate the preservation of Casimir invariants and show that the hyperbolic quasi-geostrophic equations can be simulated in a stable manner over long time. We show the emergence of longitudonal jets, wrapped around the circumference of the sphere in a general direction that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation.</description>

Abstract: Wall-bounded turbulence is characterized by coherent, worm-like structures such as hairpin vortices. The attached-eddy model provides a successful statistical framework for the log-law region, yet the complex geometry and multiscale nature of wall-turbulence vortices remain challenging for physics-based modelling. Here, we model wall turbulence as an ensemble of complex vortices, introducing a systematic approach to constructing turbulence fields enriched with hierarchically organized hairpin vortex packets. The geometry and organization of the vortex packets are calibrated to match observations, enabling the model to reproduce both attached and detached motions through a height-dependent core-size variation. Our model successfully reproduces the key statistical and structural features of wall turbulence, matching direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow at friction Reynolds numbers from 1,000 to 10,000. More importantly, it also reveals new insights into the coherent structures, emphasizing the role of vortex geometry, packet organization, and hierarchy in setting the attached/detached balance, meandering streaks and inclination angles, superstructure alignment, and the overall partition of contributions. Moreover, the constructed channel turbulence rapidly transitions into fully developed turbulence in direct numerical simulation, demonstrating its physical self-consistency and practical utility for initializing high-fidelity simulations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs associated with turbulence development while providing a flexible framework for testing and advancing turbulence models based on vortex structures.</description>

      <title>Integer Lattice Gas with a sampling collision operator for the fluctuating Navier-Stokes Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a step in the direction of developing integer lattice gas methods as an attractive alternative to lattice Boltzmann methods. Here we show that to Boltzmann limit the one dimensional Blommel integer lattice gas is very close to entropic lattice Boltzmann. More interestingly the integer lattice gas retains additional correlations that prevent the existence of a well defined Boltzmann limit. In the analysis of the decaying sine wave we will see that in some situations the bulk viscosity can crucially depend on such correlations beyond the Boltzmann limit. A sampling collision operator, introduced here, can speed up the execution time to make the algorithm obtain comparable computational efficiency to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods.</description>

      <title>A physically-informed sea spray generation model for splashing waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02486</link>

Abstract: Large sea spray drops - of up to 2mm in diameter - constitute one of the most uncertain factors controlling the intensification of hurricanes and severe storms because their generation mechanisms are not understood. Wave splashing produces among the largest spray drops, but observational data regarding these drops is difficult to obtain and hence cannot inform current modelling efforts. In this study, we instead propose a sea spray generation function (SSGF) for ocean wave splashing by assembling a model from first principles. First, we introduce the transverse collision of two cylindrical liquid rims as the basic mechanism for drop production. We characterize the resulting drop production in terms of three competing processes: ligament production and merging, drop generation by end-pinching, and gravity which arrests the mechanism. Second, we formulate a theoretical model which explains the drop size distributions produced by the colliding rims and test it against existing experimental and numerical data. Finally, the model can be developed into a full SSGF by incorporating sea state information with relatively few tuning parameters. The model is flexible and can be extended by including related effects such as finite droplet lifetime and secondary breakup. Altogether, our model suggests that wave splashing can efficiently produce numerous secondary droplets, challenging prior assumptions that it is an inefficient generation mechanism for sea spray.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling and Upscaling of Hydrodynamic Transport in Geological Fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing hydrodynamic transport in fractured rocks is essential for carbon storage and geothermal energy production. Multiscale heterogeneities lead to anomalous solute transport, with breakthrough-curve (BTC) tailing and nonlinear growth of plume moments. We study purely advective transport in synthetic fractures with prescribed relative closure $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $ and correlation length $ L_c $. For each geometry we generate multiple realizations and solve steady, depth-averaged Stokes flow under the lubrication approximation. Flow heterogeneity persists up to $ L_c $. The ensemble-averaged velocity PDFs are insensitive to $ L_c $ but strongly affected by $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $, particularly their low-velocity power-law scaling. A time-domain random walk (TDRW) yields plume moments and outlet BTCs: the mean longitudinal position grows linearly in time, while the variance shows early ballistic scaling and a late-time regime controlled by the low-velocity power law with exponent $ \alpha $, which depends on $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $. BTC properties, including peak broadening and tail scaling, are likewise governed by $ \alpha $. We further model advection with a one-dimensional continuous-time random walk (CTRW) that uses only the velocity PDF, flow tortuosity, and $ L_c $. CTRW results closely match TDRW and enable analytical predictions of asymptotic transport scalings.</description>

      <title>Verification of Convergent-Divergent Nozzle Designs in Propulsion Aerospace Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of convergent divergent nozzles plays a critical role in aerospace propulsion systems, where efficient expansion of high-temperature, high-pressure gases directly impacts thrust generation. In this study, we investigate a series of nozzle geometries using numerical simulations performed in ANSYS Fluent, with design parameters guided by classical compressible flow theory, initially developed by Ludwig Prandtl. The governing equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are solved under steady state conditions, with emphasis on shock formation, boundary-layer effects, and Mach number distributions across the nozzle throat and divergent section. Parametric analyses are conducted to evaluate the influence of nozzle contour, area ratio, and throat geometry on flow acceleration and thrust coefficient. The results demonstrate close agreement with theoretical predictions of isentropic compressible flow while also highlighting deviations due to viscous and three-dimensional effects. These findings provide design insights for optimizing nozzle performance in propulsion applications ranging from launch vehicles to high speed air breathing systems.</description>

      <title>FlowPrecision: Advancing FPGA-Based Real-Time Fluid Flow Estimation with Linear Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In industrial and environmental monitoring, achieving real-time and precise fluid flow measurement remains a critical challenge. This study applies linear quantization in FPGA-based soft sensors for fluid flow estimation, significantly enhancing Neural Network model precision by overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed-point quantization. Our approach achieves up to a 10.10% reduction in Mean Squared Error and a notable 9.39% improvement in inference speed through targeted hardware optimizations. Validated across multiple data sets, our findings demonstrate that the optimized FPGA-based quantized models can provide efficient, accurate real-time inference, offering a viable alternative to cloud-based processing in pervasive autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</description>

      <title>A critical assessment of reinforcement learning methods for microswimmer navigation in complex flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating in a fluid flow while being carried by it, using only information accessible from on-board sensors, is a problem commonly faced by small planktonic organisms. It is also directly relevant to autonomous robots deployed in the oceans. In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community has widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest implementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the strategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a quantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation in partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of directional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically. We then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used algorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered in the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and two-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established dominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the theoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust manner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques, such as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well as hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of algorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering truly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows.</description>

      <title>von Karman - Howarth Similarity of Spatial Correlations and the Distribution of Correlation Lengths in Solar Photospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the Sun's photospheric magnetic field are the primary source of the turbulence that can heat and accelerate the solar atmosphere, and thus play an important role in the production and evolution of the solar wind that permeates the heliosphere. A key parameter that characterizes this turbulence is the correlation scale of fluctuations, which determines the injection of turbulent energy into the plasma and the diffusive transport of solar energetic particles. This study employs magnetogram data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory to characterize an ensemble of spatial autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of turbulence in the photosphere. It is shown that the two-point ACFs satisfy the similarity-decay hypothesis of von K\'arm\'an and Howarth, a fundamental property of turbulent systems: rescaling the ACFs by their respective energies and correlation lengths yields a quasi-universal exponential form. The probability distribution function of transverse correlation lengths (\(\lambda\)) is shown to be approximately log-normal, which is consistent with observations of turbulence in the solar wind. A ``mosaic'' of the spatial distribution of \(\lambda\) over the photosphere is presented; the ``quiet Sun'' tends to have \(\lambda\sim 1500\) km (albeit with a wide distribution), which is close to the scale of solar granulation; systematically longer lengths are associated with active regions. A positive correlation is observed between mean magnetic field magnitude and \(\lambda\), and empirical fits quantify this relationship. These results improve our understanding of solar turbulence while providing observational constraints for models that describe turbulence transport from solar and stellar photospheres into their atmospheres.</description>
