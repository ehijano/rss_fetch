      <title>Asymptotics of survival probabilities and lower tail probability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is an addendum to the paper ``L\'evy models amenable to efficient calculations", where we introduced a general class of Stieltjes-L\'evy processes (SL-processes) and signed SL processes defined in terms of certain Stieltjes-L\'evy measures. We demonstrated that SL-processes enjoyed all properties that we used earlier to develop efficient methods for evaluation of expectations of functions of a L\'evy process and its extremum processes, and proved that essentially all popular classes of L\'evy processes are SL-processes; sSL-processes fail to possess one important property. In the present paper, we use the properties of (s)SL-processes to derive new formulas for the Wiener-Hopf factors $\phi^\pm_q$ for small $q$ in terms of the absolute continuous components of SL-measures and their densities, and calculate the leading terms of the survival probability also in terms of the absolute continuous components of SL-measures and their densities. The lower tail probability is calculated for more general classes of SINH-regular processes constructed earlier.</description>

      <title>Local convergence near equilibria for distribution dependent SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to exhibiting phase transitions, we investigate the local convergence around a stationary distribution for distribution dependent stochastic differential equations. By linearizing the nonlinear Markov semigroup associated with the distribution dependent equation, the local exponential convergence of the solution is related to the exponential convergence of a semigroup of linear operators. Our result can be used a criteria for the local stability of stationary distributions. Concrete examples, including the granular media equation with double-wells landscapes and quadratic interaction, are given to illustrate our main result.</description>

      <title>Random walks with square-root boundaries: the case of exact boundaries $g(t)=c\sqrt{t+b}-a$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S(n)$ be a real valued random walk with i.i.d. increments which have zero mean and finite variance. We are interested in the asymptotic properties of the stopping time $T(g):=\inf\{n\ge1: S(n)\le g(n)\}$, where $g(t)$ is a boundary function. In the present paper we deal with the parametric family of boundaries $\{g_{a,b}(t)=c\sqrt{t+b}-a, b\ge0, a&gt;c\sqrt{b}\}$. First, assuming that sufficiently many moments of increments of the walk are finite, we construct a positive space-time harmonic function $W(a,b)$. Then we show that there exist $p(c)&gt;0$ and a constant $\varkappa(c)$ such that
  $\mathbf{P}(T_{g_{a,b}}&gt;n)\sim \varkappa(c)\frac{W(a,b)}{n^{p(c)/2}}$ as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Weighted Besov spaces on Heisenberg groups and applications to the Parabolic Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims at a proper definition and resolution of the parabolic Anderson model on Heisenberg groups $\mathbf{H}_{n}$. This stochastic PDE is understood in a pathwise (Stratonovich) sense. We consider a noise which is smoother than white noise in time, with a spatial covariance function generated by negative powers $(-\Delta)^{-\alpha}$ of the sub-Laplacian on $\mathbf{H}_{n}$. We give optimal conditions on the covariance function so that the stochastic PDE is solvable. A large portion of the article is dedicated to a detailed definition of weighted Besov spaces on $\mathbf{H}_{n}$. This definition, related paraproducts and heat flow smoothing properties, forms a necessary step in the resolution of our main equation. It also appears to be new and of independent interest. It relies on a recent approach, called projective, to Fourier transforms on $\mathbf{H}_{n}$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-form Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of quadratic-form optimal transport (QOT), whose transport cost has the form $\iint c\,\mathrm{d}\pi \otimes\mathrm{d}\pi$ for some coupling $\pi$ between two marginals. Interesting examples of quadratic-form transport cost and their optimization include the variance of a bivariate function, covariance, Kendall's tau, the Gromov--Wasserstein distance, quadratic assignment problems, and quadratic regularization of classic optimal transport. QOT leads to substantially different mathematical structures compared to classic transport problems and many technical challenges. We illustrate the fundamental properties of QOT, provide several cases where explicit solutions are obtained, and give general lower bounds of the optimal transport costs. For a wide class of cost functions, including the rectangular cost functions, the QOT problem is solved by a new coupling called the diamond transport, whose copula is supported on a diamond in the unit square.</description>

      <title>Limiting behavior of mixed coherent systems with L\'evy-frailty Marshall-Olkin failure times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show a limit result for the reliability function of a system -- that is, the probability that the whole system is still operational after a certain given time -- when the number of components of the system grows to infinity. More specifically, we consider a sequence of mixed coherent systems whose components are homogeneous and non-repairable, with failure-times governed by a L\'evy-frailty Marshall-Olkin (LFMO) distribution -- a distribution that allows simultaneous component failures. We show that under integrability conditions the reliability function converges to the probability of a first-passage time of a L\'evy subordinator process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to tackle the asymptotic behavior of the reliability function as the number of components of the system grows. To illustrate our approach, we give an example of a parametric family of reliability functions where the system failure time converges in distribution to an exponential random variable, and give computational experiments testing convergence.</description>

      <title>Computing Barycentres of Measures for Generic Transport Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein barycentres represent average distributions between multiple probability measures for the Wasserstein distance. The numerical computation of Wasserstein barycentres is notoriously challenging. A common approach is to use Sinkhorn iterations, where an entropic regularisation term is introduced to make the problem more manageable. Another approach involves using fixed-point methods, akin to those employed for computing Fr\'echet means on manifolds. The convergence of such methods for 2-Wasserstein barycentres, specifically with a quadratic cost function and absolutely continuous measures, was studied by Alvarez-Esteban et al. (2016). In this paper, we delve into the main ideas behind this fixed-point method and explore how it can be generalised to accommodate more diverse transport costs and generic probability measures, thereby extending its applicability to a broader range of problems. We show convergence results for this approach and illustrate its numerical behaviour on several barycentre problems.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel Estimates for Schr\"odinger Operators with Decay at Infinity on Parabolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04221v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give estimates for positive solutions for the Schr\"odinger equation $(\Delta_\mu+W)u=0$ on a wide class of parabolic weighted manifolds $(M, d\mu)$ when $W$ decays to zero at infinity faster than quadratically. These can be combined with results of Grigor'yan to give matching upper and lower bounds for the heat kernel of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta_\mu+W$. In particular, this appears to complement known results for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbf{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Quantitative Stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality is a classical extension of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality, which in turn is a functional counterpart of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. The stability of these inequalities has received significant attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress in the geometric setting, a sharp quantitative stability result for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality has remained elusive, even in the special case of log-concave functions. In this work, we provide a unified and definitive stability framework for these foundational inequalities. By establishing the optimal quantitative stability for the Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality in full generality, we resolve the conjectured sharp stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality as a particular case. Our approach builds on the recent sharp stability results for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality obtained by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the macroscopic behavior of asymmetric attractive zero-range processes on $\mathbb{Z}$ where particles are destroyed at the origin at a rate of order $N^\beta$, where $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and $N\in\mathbb{N}$ is the scaling parameter. We prove that the hydrodynamic limit of this particle system is described by the unique entropy solution of a hyperbolic conservation law, supplemented by a boundary condition depending on the range of $\beta$. Namely, if $\beta \geqslant 0$, then the boundary condition prescribes the particle current through the origin, whereas if $\beta&lt;0$, the destruction of particles at the origin has no macroscopic effect on the system and no boundary condition is imposed at the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider three-dimensional nonlinear stochastic wave equations driven by the Gaussian noise which is white in time and has some spatial correlations. Using the Malliavin-Stein's method, we prove the Gaussian fluctuation for the spatial average of the solution under the Wasserstein distance in the cases where the spatial correlation is given by an integrable function and by the Riesz kernel. In both cases we also establish functional central limit theorems.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric estimation of the reaction term in semi-linear SPDEs with spatial ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the non-parametric estimation of a non-linear reaction term in a semi-linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The estimator's consistency is due to the spatial ergodicity of the SPDE while the time horizon remains fixed. The analysis of the estimation error requires the concentration of spatial averages of non-linear transformations of the SPDE. The method developed in this paper combines the Clark-Ocone formula from Malliavin calculus with the Markovianity of the SPDE and density estimates. The resulting variance bound utilises the averaging effect of the conditional expectation in the Clark-Ocone formula. The method is applied to two realistic asymptotic regimes. The focus is on a coupling between the diffusivity and the noise level, where both tend to zero. Secondly, the observation of a fixed SPDE on a growing spatial observation window is considered. Furthermore, the concentration of the occupation time around the occupation measure is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic wave equations in spatial dimensions $d \geq 4$. We assume that the driving noise is given by a Gaussian noise that is white in time and has some spatial correlation. When the spatial correlation is given by the Riesz kernel, we also establish that the spatial integral of the solution with proper normalization converges to the standard normal distribution under the Wasserstein distance. The convergence is obtained by first constructing the approximation sequence to the solution and then applying Malliavin-Stein's method to the normalized spatial integral of the sequence. The corresponding functional central limit theorem is presented as well.</description>

Rudelson and Tikhomirov, in a beautiful and celebrated paper, show that the distribution of eigenvalues of $A_n \cdot (pn)^{-1/2}$ is approximately uniform on the unit disk as $n\rightarrow \infty$ as long as $pn \rightarrow \infty$, which is the natural necessary condition.
  In this paper we give a much simpler proof of this result, in its full generality, using a perspective we developed in our recent proof of the existence of the limiting spectral law when $pn$ is bounded. One feature of our proof is that it avoids the use of $\epsilon$-nets entirely and, instead, proceeds by studying the evolution of the singular values of the shifted matrices $A_n-zI$ as we incrementally expose the randomness in the matrix.</description>

      <title>The tail distribution of the partition function for directed polymer in the weak disorder phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the upper tail distribution of the partition function of the directed polymer in a random environment on $\mathbb Z^d$ in the weak disorder phase. We show that the distribution of the infinite volume partition function $W^{\beta}_{\infty}$ displays a power-law decay, with an exponent $p^*(\beta)\in [1+\frac{2}{d},\infty)$. We also prove that the distribution of the suprema of the point-to-point and point-to-line partition functions display the same behavior. On the way to these results, we prove a technical estimate of independent interest: the $L^p$-norm of the partition function at the time when it overshoots a high value $A$ is comparable to $A$. We use this estimate to extend the validity of many recent results that were proved under the assumption that the environment is upper bounded.</description>

      <title>On the Spielman-Teng Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with iid subgaussian entries with mean $0$ and variance $1$ and let $\sigma_n(M)$ denote the least singular value of $M$. We prove that \[\mathbb{P}\big( \sigma_{n}(M) \leq \varepsilon n^{-1/2} \big) = (1+o(1)) \varepsilon + e^{-\Omega(n)}\] for all $0 \leq \varepsilon \ll 1$. This resolves, up to a $1+o(1)$ factor, a seminal conjecture of Spielman and Teng.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin Calculus Approach to Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions to multi-dimensional backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), whose (possibly random) generator reflects nonlinear dependence on both the solution process and the martingale integrand component of the adapted solutions, as well as their diagonal processes. The well-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which renders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes while contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semi-linear partial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of BSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize dynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment opportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands being identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.</description>

      <title>From elephant to goldfish (and back): memory in stochastic Volterra processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theoretical framework that exploits convolution kernels to transform a Volterra path-dependent (non-Markovian) stochastic process into a standard (Markovian) diffusion process. This transformation is achieved by embedding a Markovian "memory process" within the dynamics of the non-Markovian process. We discuss existence and path-wise regularity of solutions for the stochastic Volterra equations introduced and we provide a financial application to volatility modeling. We also propose a numerical scheme for simulating the processes. The numerical scheme exhibits a strong convergence rate of 1/2, which is independent of the roughness parameter of the volatility process. This is a significant improvement compared to Euler schemes used in similar models.
  We propose a new theoretical framework that exploits convolution kernels to transform a Volterra path-dependent (non-Markovian) stochastic process into a standard (Markovian) diffusion process. This transformation is achieved by embedding a Markovian "memory process" (the goldfish) within the dynamics of the non-Markovian process (the elephant). Most notably, it is also possible to go back, i.e., the transformation is reversible. We discuss existence and path-wise regularity of solutions for the stochastic Volterra equations introduced and we propose a numerical scheme for simulating the processes, which exhibits a remarkable convergence rate of $1/2$. In particular, in the fractional kernel case, the strong convergence rate is independent of the roughness parameter, which is a positive novelty in contrast with what happens in the available Euler schemes in the literature in rough volatility models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a target probability density function in frameworks where parallel evaluations of the log-density gradient are feasible. Focusing on smooth and strongly log-concave densities, we revisit the parallelized randomized midpoint method and investigate its properties using recently developed techniques for analyzing its sequential version. Through these techniques, we derive upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between sampling and target densities. These bounds quantify the substantial runtime improvements achieved through parallel processing.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations and deep neural networks with ReLU, leaky ReLU, and softplus activation overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating semilinear parabolic partial differential equations in $L^p$-sense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that multilevel Picard approximations and deep neural networks with ReLU, leaky ReLU, and softplus activation are capable of approximating solutions of semilinear Kolmogorov PDEs in $L^\mathfrak{p}$-sense, $\mathfrak{p}\in [2,\infty)$, in the case of gradient-independent, Lipschitz-continuous nonlinearities, while the computational effort of the multilevel Picard approximations and the required number of parameters in the neural networks grow at most polynomially in both dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for vector-valued composite functionals with smoothing and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on vector-valued composite functionals, which may be nonlinear in probability. Our primary goal is to establish central limit theorems for these functionals when mixed estimators are employed. Our study is relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning methods. A generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which encompasses most of the known coherent risk measures including systemic measures of risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze vector-valued functionals, providing a framework for evaluating high-dimensional risks. This framework facilitates the comparison of multiple risk measures, as well as the estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic risk and its optimal value in decision-making problems. Second, we derive novel central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals when mixed types of estimators: empirical and smoothed estimators are used. We provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the central limit formulae and show their applicability to several popular measures of risk.</description>
