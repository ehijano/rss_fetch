      <title>The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS): SDSS spectroscopic observations of X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03872v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present one of the largest uniform optical spectroscopic surveys of X-ray selected sources to date that were observed as a pilot study for the Black Hole Mapper (BHM) survey. The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0&lt;z&lt;5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)&gt;6.5x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt;2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.</description>

      <title>The Relative Contributions of Accretion Disk versus Jet to the Optical and Mid-infrared Variability of Seyfert Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a comprehensive analysis of flux and color variability in a redshift-matched sample of Seyfert galaxies, comprising 23 gamma-ray-detected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (gNLS1s), 190 non-gamma-ray-detected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (ngNLS1s), and 10 gamma-ray-detected broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (gBLS1s). Utilizing multi-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in g, r, and i bands, along with mid-infrared (MIR) observations in W1 and W2 bands from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we observed that gBLS1s exhibit more significant variability than gNLS1s, while ngNLS1s display minimal variability across both optical and MIR wavelengths. The pronounced variability in gBLS1s may be attributed to a more closely aligned jet relative to the observer's line of sight or their comparatively lower accretion rates. In contrast, the subdued variability in ngNLS1s suggests that their flux changes are primarily driven by accretion disk instabilities. A significant correlation between optical and MIR variability amplitudes found here supports the reprocessing scenario, wherein variations in the accretion disk emission are re-emitted by surrounding dust. Furthermore, our long-term color variability analysis revealed a stronger redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend in approximately 35%, 61%, and 80% of gNLS1s, ngNLS1s, and gBLS1s, respectively, in optical wavelength, strengthens the reprocessing scenario with the observed trend of stronger RWB for approximately 68%, 96%, and 30%, respectively, in MIR wavelength. The prevalent RWB trend observed in both optical and MIR wavelengths from the current sample of Seyfert galaxies on the longer time scales is likely associated with accretion disk instabilities.</description>

      <title>Variability of X-ray polarization of Cyg X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a three-year X-ray, optical, and radio polarimetric monitoring campaign of the prototypical black hole X-ray binary Cyg X-1, conducted from 2022 to 2024. The X-ray polarization of Cyg X-1 was measured 13 times with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), covering both hard and soft spectral states. The X-ray polarization degree (PD) in the hard state was found to be $\approx4.0\%$, roughly twice as high as in the soft state, where it was around $2.2\%$. In both states, a statistically significant increase of PD with the energy was found. Moreover, a linear relation between PD and spectral hardness suggests a gradual and continuous evolution of the polarization properties, rather than an abrupt change of polarization production mechanism between states. The polarization angle (PA) was independent of the spectral state and showed no trend with the photon energy. The X-ray PA is well aligned with the orientation of the radio jet, as well as the optical and radio PAs. We find significant orbital changes of PA in the hard state, which we attribute to scattering of X-ray emission at intrabinary structure. No significant superorbital variability in PD or PA was found at the period $P_{\rm{so}}$ = 294 d. We also find no correlation between the X-ray and optical polarization; if any, there is a long-term anti-correlation between the X-ray PD and the radio PD.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Evolution of SN 2023ixf: an Asymmetric Explosion in a Confined Aspherical Circumstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present complete spectropolarimetric coverage of the Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf ranging from 1 to 120 days after explosion. Polarimetry was obtained with the Kast double spectrograph on the Shane 3m telescope at Lick Observatory. As the ejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) during the first week, the intrinsic polarization of SN 2023ixf is initially high at $\lesssim$1%, dropping steeply within days down to $\sim$ 0.4% when the ejecta sweep up the optically-thick CSM. The continuum polarization stays low at $\sim$ 0.2% thereafter, until it rises again to $\sim$ 0.6% as the ejecta transition to the nebular phase. We model this evolution using a combination of archival and newly-computed 2D polarized radiative-transfer models. In this context, we interpret the early-time polarization as arising from an aspherical CSM with a pole-to-equator density contrast $\gtrsim$ 3. We propose that the surge in polarization at late times originates from an asymmetric distribution of $^{56}$Ni deep in the ejecta. The distinct sources of asymmetries at early and late times are consistent with the temporal evolution of the observed polarization and the polarization angle in SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spectral properties of magnetic turbulence by synchrotron polarization gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the modern understanding of MHD turbulence theory, we propose a new method for measuring the spectral properties of magnetic turbulence by synchrotron polarization gradient analysis. Using synthetic polarization observational data, we first confirm the feasibility of the gradient technique to determine the scaling properties of magnetic turbulence. We then apply this technique to the Galactic plane survey data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and obtain the power-law spectral feature of the Galactic magnetic turbulence of $E\propto k^{-10/3}$. Gradient techniques open up a new way to obtain spectral properties of magnetic turbulence from polarization observations, such as the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy (LOFAR), in the presence of low-frequency and strong Faraday depolarization.</description>

      <title>Teleios (G305.4-2.2) -- the mystery of a perfectly shaped new Galactic supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the serendipitous radio-continuum discovery of a likely Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G305.4-2.2. This object displays a remarkable circular symmetry in shape, making it one of the most circular Galactic SNRs known. Nicknamed Teleios due to its symmetry, it was detected in the new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) radio-continuum images with an angular size of 1320"x1260" and PA = 0 deg. While there is a hint of possible H$\alpha$ and gamma-ray emission, Teleios is exclusively seen at radio-continuum frequencies. Interestingly, Teleios is not only almost perfectly symmetric, but it also has one of the lowest surface brightnesses discovered among Galactic SNRs and a steep spectral index of $\alpha=-0.6\pm 0.3$. Our estimates from HI studies and the Sigma-D relation place Teleios as a type Ia SNR at a distance of either ~2.2 kpc of ~7.7 kpc. This indicates two possible scenarios, either a young (under 1000 yr) or an older SNR (over 10000 yr). With a corresponding diameter of 14/48 pc, our evolutionary studies place Teleios at the either early or late Sedov phase, depending on the distance estimate. However, our modelling also predicts X-ray emission, which we do not see in the present generation of eROSITA images. We also explored a type Iax explosion scenario that points to a much closer distance of &lt;1 kpc and Teleios size of only ~3.3 pc, which would be similar to the only known type Iax remnant SN1181. Unfortunately, all examined scenarios have their challenges, and no definitive supernova (SN) origin type can be established at this stage. Teleios's symmetrical shape suggests expansion into a rarefied and isotropic ambient medium. The low radio surface brightness and the lack of pronounced polarisation can be explained by a high level of ambient rotation measure (RM), with the largest RM being observed at centre.</description>

      <title>Leptohadronic Multimessenger Modeling of Two High-redshift (z $&gt;$ 1) Neutrino Emission Blazar Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blazars are one of the leading candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Recently, two blazars have been found to be temporally and spatially correlated with some IceCube high-energy neutrino events. The two blazars, GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948, are Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with redshifts greater than unity. In particular, NVSS J171822+423948 has a redshift of 2.7, which provides an important probe for studying the radiation processes of jets from active galactic nuclei in the early universe. To better understand the physical origin of the IceCube neutrinos, we adopt the one-zone leptohadronic model to fit the multimessenger emission of GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948 during their $\gamma$-ray flaring periods and then calculate the high-energy neutrino detection probability. The chance of detecting a single muon neutrino from these two sources is found to be $\sim 2\%$ and $0.8\%$, respectively. Although such detection rates are not high mainly because of their high redshifts, our investigation strongly suggests that these sources are efficient PeV neutrino emitters. Our results also indicate that electromagnetic cascades produced by hadronic processes contribute significantly to X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emissions. However, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be severely absorbed by the soft photon field from the broad-line region (BLR), which weakens the correlation between $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos, while suggesting a stronger connection between X-rays and neutrinos. We predict that IceCube will continue to detect neutrinos from FSRQs with redshifts greater than 1 in the future.</description>

      <title>4XMM J175136.8-275858: A New Magnetar Candidate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are very rare astrophysical objects, with $\sim$31 known to date. They are best understood as highly magnetised neutron stars, but a greater number need to be found to constrain their role in stellar evolution pathways. We apply a novel approach for the detection of fast, transient X-ray sources, using a revised version of the EPIC XMM-Newton Outburst Detector (EXOD) with the aim of detecting and identifying new and rare variable compact objects. We detect a transient, variable source notable for its strong variability and hard spectrum. The emission from 4XMM J175136.8-275858 is well characterised by a blackbody, with temperatures between $\sim$1.8--5\,keV during its lower luminosity phase. Its temperature is poorly constrained during its brightest phase, and we observe an increase in luminosity by two orders of magnitude over timescales of a few ks. This is driven by increased emission of X-rays at energies above 2\,keV, with a luminosity decay potentially over weeks or months. Derived luminosities for 4XJ1751-2759 range up to $\sim10^{35} \text{\,erg s}^{-1}$ at 8\,kpc at the Galactic centre, but neutral hydrogen column densities are greater than predicted Galactic values possibly implying a greater distance to the source, still within our galaxy, further increasing its luminosity. A consideration of optical and IR information in combination with the X-ray observations allow us to exclude the possibility that 4XJ1751-2759 is a star, rotationally powered pulsar or supergiant fast X-ray transient. This rapid, hard, variability is closest to that of outbursts in magnetars than any other known class of X-ray transient.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our current knowledge of thermal and viscous instabilities in accretion discs around compact objects. We begin with classical disc models based on analytic viscosity prescriptions, discussing physical uncertainties and exploring time-dependent solutions of disc evolution. We also review the ionization instability responsible for outbursting dwarf nova and X-ray binary systems, including some detailed comparisons between alpha-based models and the observed characteristics of these systems. We then review modern theoretical work based on ideas around angular momentum transport mediated by magnetic fields, focusing in particular on knowledge gained through local and global computer simulations of MHD processes in discs. We discuss how MHD may alter our understanding of outbursts in white dwarf and X-ray binary systems. Finally, we turn to the putative thermal/viscous instabilities that were predicted to exist in the inner, radiation pressure-dominated regions of black hole and neutron star discs, in apparent contradiction to the observed stability of the high/soft state in black hole X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Slow and steady: long-term evolution of the 76-second pulsar J0901$-$4046</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J0901$-$4046, a likely radio-loud neutron star with a period of 75.88 seconds, challenges conventional models of neutron star radio emission. Here, we showcase results from 46 hours of follow-up observations of PSR J0901$-$4046 using the MeerKAT, Murriyang, GMRT, and MWA radio telescopes. We demonstrate the intriguing stability of the source's timing solution over more than three years, leading to an RMS arrival-time uncertainty of just $\sim$10$^{-4}$ of the rotation period. Furthermore, non-detection below 500 MHz may indicate a low-frequency turnover in the source's spectrum, while no secular decline in the flux density of the source over time, as was apparent from previous observations, has been observed. Using high time-resolution MeerKAT data, we demonstrate two distinct quasi-periodic oscillation modes present in single pulses, with characteristic time scales of 73 ms and 21 ms. We also observe a statistically significant change in the relative prevalence of distinct pulse morphologies compared to previous observations, possibly indicating a shift in the magnetospheric composition over time. Finally, we show that the W$_{50}$ pulse width is nearly constant from 544-4032 MHz, consistent with zero radius-to-frequency mapping. The very short duty cycle ($\sim$1.4$^{\circ}$) is more similar to radio pulsars with periods $&gt;$5 seconds than to radio-loud magnetars. This, along with the lack of magnetar-like outbursts or timing glitches, complicates the identification of the source with ultra-long period magnetar models.</description>

      <title>Swift/XRT monitoring of the orbital and superorbital modulations in 4U 1909+07</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04452v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an observational campaign performed with Swift/XRT on the wind-fed supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1909+07 to investigate the nature of the orbital and superorbital modulation of its X-ray emission. A total of 137 XRT observations have been carried out, summing up to a total effective exposure time of 114 ks and covering a total of 66 orbital and 19 superorbital cycles of the source. The XRT data folded on the orbital period of the source confirmed and improved the previously reported variability in intensity and absorption column density, which can be ascribed to the neutron star accreting from the wind of its B supergiant companion across a fairly circular orbit. The XRT data folded on the superorbital period did not provide evidence of significant variations in either the absorption column density and/or the power-law photon index. This may be due to a significant weakening of the superorbital modulation during the times when the XRT observations were carried out, as confirmed by the BAT dynamic power spectrum. We discuss the implications of these findings within the corotating interaction region model proposed to interpret the superorbital variability in wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic precession as a model for QPOs in PULXs: flat-top noise ULXs are different</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Several instances of low frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) have been reported in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), including three in pulsating ones (PULXs) to date. The nature of many ULXs is still unclear, as are the detailed properties of accretion in PULXs. Aims. We seek an answer to questions such as: Is there a QPO model that fits the data? Can mHz QPOs be used to constrain the magnetic field and accretion rate of the neutron stars in PULXs? Are all the low frequency QPOs in ULXs a manifestation of the same phenomenon? Methods. We apply Dong Lai's precession model to the PULX data, with the magnetic threading of the accretion disk constrained by recent simulations. Results. Based on the magnetic precession model, and on recent progress in understanding the inner structure of accretion disks, we predict an inverse scaling of QPO frequency with the neutron star period in PULXs. The theoretical curve is largely independent of the stellar magnetic field or mass accretion rate and agrees with the data for the known QPOs in PULXs. The flat-top QPOs detected in ULXs have observational properties that seem to be very different from the QPOs detected in PULXs, indicating they might have a different origin.</description>

      <title>I-Love-Q Relations of Fermion-Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of fermion-boson stars (FBSs), which can be viewed as neutron stars with a bosonic dark matter (DM) admixture. A challenge in studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally accepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS), making it difficult to distinguish between the effects of DM and various EOS models. To address this issue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars to FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson particle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs and explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q relations. The properties of FBSs and the level of deviations in general depend sensitively on the DM parameters. For boson particle mass within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV})$, where the Compton wavelength is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a $1 M_\odot$ star, the deviation is up to about 5% level if the star contains a few percent of DM admixture. The deviation increases significantly with a higher amount of DM. We also find that the universal relations are still valid to within a 1% deviation level for boson particle mass $m_b \geq 26.8\times10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV}$. This effectively sets an upper bound on the boson particle mass, beyond which it becomes not feasible to probe the properties of FBSs by investigating the I-Love-Q relation violations.</description>

      <title>Early and Extensive Ultraviolet Through Near Infrared Observations of the Intermediate-Luminosity Type Iax Supernovae 2024pxl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.</description>

      <title>First Observations of Solar Halo Gamma Rays Over a Full Solar Cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Broad line region echo from rapidly accreting intermediate-mass black hole candidate SDSS J144850.08+160803.1. The first probe of intra-night variability and reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $100~M_{\odot} \leq M_{\rm BH}\leq 2\times10^{5}~M_{\odot}$) can act as ``time-squeezing'' machines, enabling studies of AGN geometry through reverberation mapping (RM) on much shorter timescales than their supermassive siblings. Aims. The broad line region (BLR) radius constraints for IMBH candidates with different Eddington ratios probe the unexplored faint end of radius--luminosity ($R-L$) relations and allow us to build a robust $M_{\rm BH}$ estimator. This study aims to (a) confirm a rapidly accreting IMBH candidate; (b) demonstrate the feasibility of the first photometric BLR reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for this class of objects. Methods. The IMBH candidate J1448+16 was identified in the broad H$\alpha$-selected spectroscopic sample from SDSS. We carried out narrow-band H$\alpha$ and broad-band SDSS~g\'~monitoring to check small-scale variability and extract the time lag between the BLR and accretion disk (AD) continuum during 5 months (March--July 2024) using a 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. Results. We confirmed the candidate as an active IMBH using XMM-Newton as a bright X-ray point source with the photon index $\Gamma = 2.32^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$, suggesting the high accretion rate. From a combination of SDSS optical spectra and XMM-Newton observations, we estimate the black hole mass in the range $\sim 0.9-2.4~\times10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and the Eddington rate from $\sim 37-112\%$. We report high-amplitude $\sim 60\%$ intra-night ($\sim 2$~h) H$\alpha$ variability in this highly accreting IMBH. In addition, we extracted a tentative measurement of a BLR RM radius $\sim 1-8~\mathrm{days}$. Conclusions. This work is a proof of concept for further IMBH variability studies and BLR RM campaigns, which will be essential for the calibration of the $R-L$ relation at the faint end.</description>

      <title>Relativistic structure of a supermassive black hole embedded in the dark matter halo of NGC 4649 (M60)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo, formulated as a non-vacuum extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity dispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric depends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the asymptotic circular velocity $V_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly reduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V_c \to 0$ and $a \to 0$. We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic properties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit, characterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite tangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole thermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating astrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing strong-field gravity through precision observational data.</description>

      <title>Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>Scintillometry of Fast Radio Bursts: Resolution effects in two-screen models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) exhibit scintillation and scattering, often attributed to interactions with plasma screens in the Milky Way and the host galaxy. When these two screens appear "point-like" to each other, two scales of scintillation can be observed with sufficient frequency resolution. A screen perceives a second screen as extended or resolved when the angular size of the latter is smaller than the angular resolution of the former. We define the ratio of these two as the Resolution Power (RP). Previous observational studies have argued that, in the resolving regime, scintillations disappear, assuming that a screen resolving another screen is equivalent to a screen resolving an incoherent emission region. In this theoretical and simulation-based study of resolving effects in two-screen scenarios, we argue that resolving quenches only the relatively broad-scale scintillation and that this quenching is a gradual process. We present qualitative and quantitative predictions for dynamic spectra, spectral autocorrelation functions (ACF), and modulation indices in resolved and unresolved regimes of two-screen systems. We show that the spectral ACF of a two-screen system has a product term in addition to the sum of individual screen contributions, causing the total modulation index to rise to \sqrt(3) in the unresolved regime. To aid in discovering resolving systems, we also present observable trends in multi-frequency observations of a screen resolving another screen or incoherent emission. Additionally we introduce a new formula to estimate the distance between the FRB and the screen in its host galaxy. We also show that this formula, like previous ones in the literature, is only applicable to screens that are two-dimensional in the plane of the sky.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Population Constraints with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a massive black hole and a stellar compact object, are one of the most important sources for space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Their population study can be used to constrain astrophysical models that interpret the EMRI formation mechanisms. In this paper, as an initial attempt, we employ a parametrization method to describe the EMRI population model in the loss cone formation channel. This approach, however, can be extended to other models such as the accretion disc driven formation channel. We present the phenomenological characteristic of the MBH mass, spin, and redshift distributions. Then, we investigate the posterior distribution of the hyper-parameters that describe this population model. The optimistic results show that TianQin could recover almost all the posterior of the hyper-parameters within $1\sigma$ confidence interval. The hyper-parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, b$, which describe the MBH mass distribution, could be measured with an accuracy of $46.4\%$, $12.6\%$, and $3\%$, respectively. The hyper-parameters $\mu_z$, and $\sigma_z$, which describe the redshift distribution, could be measured with an accuracy of $15.4\%$ and $21.1\%$. With this estimation accuracy, the EMRI population characteristics can be effectively demonstrated, potentially serving as evidence for EMRI formation in the future studies. Furthermore, with an increasing number of detectable events, the parameter estimation for the hyper-parameters will improve and the confidence intervals will be narrowed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic accretion flow explains the hysteresis q-diagram seen in outbursts of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole low-mass X-ray binaries undergo quiescence-outburst cycles. During the outbursts, they typically go through a q-shaped pattern in the hardness-intensity diagram (HID), known as the hysteresis q-diagram, while the physical nature is still unknown. We argue that the hysteresis q-diagram can be well explained with a recently proposed magnetized accretion disk model. The model takes into account the saturated magnetic pressure and predicts that the standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) has an inner truncation at relatively low accretion rates, filled with an optically thin, hot accretion flow that resembles the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) inside. Given a perturbation of accretion rate, the variation of the truncation radius can be derived as a result of thermal equilibrium by comparing the heating and cooling rates. We show that the truncation radius displays a hysteresis effect in response to the variation of mass accretion rate. As a result, the spectral hardness due to competition of the soft SSD and hard ADAF components is also hysteresis along with the rise and decay of the mass accretion rate or source intensity, leading to a q-shaped diagram in the HID.</description>

Abstract: A weakly magnetized neutron star (NS) undergoing disk accretion should release about a half of its power in a compact region known as the accretion boundary layer. Latitudinal spread of the accreted matter and efficient radiative cooling justify the approach to this flow as a two-dimensional spreading layer (SL) on the surface of the star. Numerical simulations of SLs are challenging because of the curved geometry and supersonic nature of the problem. We develop a new two-dimensional hydrodynamics code that uses the multislope second-order MUSCL scheme in combination with an HLLC+ Riemann solver on an arbitrary irregular mesh on a spherical surface. The code is suitable and accurate for Mach numbers at least up to 5-10. Adding sinks and sources to the conserved variables, we simulate constant-rate accretion onto a spherical NS. During the early stages of accretion, heating in the equatorial region triggers convective instability that causes rapid mixing in latitudinal direction. One of the outcomes of the instability is the development of a two-armed `tennis ball' pattern rotating as a rigid body. From the point of view of a high-inclination observer, its contribution to the light curve is seen as a high-quality-factor quasi-periodic oscillation mode with a frequency considerably smaller than the rotation frequency of the matter in the SL. Other variability modes seen in the simulated light curves are probably associated with low-azimuthal-number Rossby waves.</description>

      <title>Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles</title>

Abstract: We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only &lt;15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.</description>

      <title>The kangaroo's first hop: the early fast cooling phase of EP250108a/SN 2025kg</title>

Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are a rare and poorly understood population of events. Previously difficult to detect in real time, the launch of the Einstein Probe with its wide field X-ray telescope has led to a rapid expansion in the sample and allowed the exploration of these transients across the electromagnetic spectrum. EP250108a is a recently detected example linked to an optical counterpart, SN 2025kg, or 'the kangaroo'. Together with a companion paper (Rastinejad et al. 2025), we present our observing campaign and analysis of this event. In this letter, we focus on the early evolution of the optical counterpart over the first six days, including our measurement of the redshift of $z=0.17641$. We find that the source is well-modelled by a rapidly expanding cooling blackbody. We show the observed X-ray and radio properties are consistent with a collapsar-powered jet that is low energy ($\lesssim10^{51}$ erg) and/or fails to break out of the dense material surrounding it. The optical emission therefore likely arises from a shocked cocoon resulting from the trapped jet; however, we also examine the possibility that it emerges from the shock produced as the supernova ejecta expand into a dense shell of circumstellar material. We compare to other supernovae and fast transients showing similar features, finding significant similarities with SN 2006aj and SN 2020bvc. This suggests trapped jets could be more common than previously thought and SN 2025kg may herald a larger sample of similar transients.</description>

      <title>Exploring GRBs and supernovae connection: does a superluminous hypernova population exist?</title>

Abstract: Observations of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are temporally and spatially compatible with energetic supernovae (hypernovae) has established their common origin. In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated supernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration of the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is widely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious origin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational and theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe. Specifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host galaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a magnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and long-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative explanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is required to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially extending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Lensing Tomography of Black Hole Ringdown</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger astrophysical data: Nucleonic models</title>

Abstract: [Background] Bayesian inference frameworks incorporating multi-messenger astrophysical constraints have recently been applied to covariant density functional (CDF) models to constrain their parameters. Among these, frameworks utilizing CDFs with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings furnishing the equation of state (EoS) of compact star (CS) matter have been explored. [Purpose] The aforementioned inference framework has not yet incorporated astrophysical objects with potentially extreme high masses or ultra-small radii among its constraints, leaving its flexibility and predictive power under such extreme parameters still unknown. [Method] We apply the Bayesian inference framework based on CDFs with density dependent couplings. The astrophysical data is expanded to include not only the latest multi-messenger constraints from NICER and gravitational wave events but also the highest measured mass to date for the ``black widow" pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-radius estimates for the ultra-compact, low-mass object HESS J1731-347. [Results] Our systematic Bayesian analysis indicates that our CDF models can support higher maximum masses for CSs, reaching up to $2.4$-$2.5\,M_{\odot}$. However, achieving sufficient softening of the EoS in the low-density regime to accommodate the HESS J1731-347 data remains challenging. Nonetheless, we are able to impose tighter constraints on the parameter space of CDF models, ensuring consistency with current nuclear experimental and astrophysical data. [Conclusions] CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings encompass a wide range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, providing a robust theoretical framework for interpreting compact objects. However, the predicted lower limit for the radii of low-mass stars is approximately 12 km, which stems from the restricted degrees of freedom in the isovector sector.</description>
