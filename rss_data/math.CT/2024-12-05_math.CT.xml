      <title>Twisted tensor product of dg categories and Kontsevich's Swiss Cheese conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $1$-algebra. The Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture [K2] states that the homotopy category $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathrm{Act}(A))$ of actions of $2$-algebras on $A$ has a final object and that this object is weakly equivalent to the pair $(\mathrm{Hoch}(A), A)$, where $\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$ is the cochain Hochschild complex of $A$. Here the category of actions is the category whose objects are pairs $(B,A)$ which are algebras of the chain Swiss Cheese operad such that the induced action of the little interval operad on the component $A$ coincides with the $1$-structure on $A$.
  We prove that there is a colored dg operad ${O}$ with 2 colors, weakly equivalent to the chain Swiss Cheese operad for which the following ``stricter" version of the Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture holds. Denote the two colors of ${O}$ by $a$ (for the 1-algebra argument) and $c$ (for the 2-algebra argument), denote by $E_1^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $a$, and by $E_2^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $c$. Let $\mathrm{Alg}({O})$ be the category of dg algebras over ${O}$. For a fixed $1$-algebra $A$ we also have the the category of action $\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A$ (equal to $\mathrm{Act}(A)$ in case of the Swiss Cheese operad). We prove that there is an equivalence of categories $$\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A \cong \mathrm{Alg}(E_2^{{O}})/\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$$ We stress that for this particular model of Swiss Cheese operad the statement holds on the chain level, without passage to the homotopy category.</description>

      <title>Six-Functor Formalisms II : The $\infty$-categorical compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a part of series of articles where we reprove the statements regarding the abstract six-functor formalism developed by Liu-Zheng. In this paper, we prove a theorem which is an $\infty$-categorical version for defining the exceptional pushforward functor in an abstract-six functor formalism. The article involves defining specific combinatorial simplcial sets related to the idea of compactifications and pullback squares. This theorem plays a key role in constructing the abstract six-functor formalism which shall be constructed in the forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Higher crossed modules of algebras over an operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study crossed modules in the context of algebras over an operad. To do so, in the first section, we adapt the methods of Janelidze by reviewing the notions of internal actions, precrossed modules and crossed modules in the operadic case. Moreover, we extract the Peiffer relations, well known in the Lie case, for precrossed modules over an arbitrary operad. We prove that our notion of crossed modules is equivalent to the one of Janelidze by proving that our crossed modules of algebras over a fixed operad are equivalent to categories internal to algebras over this fixed operad. In the second section, we study the notion of crossed modules of algebras over an operad as introduced by Leray-Riviere-Wagemann in arXiv:2411.04614 and prove it to be equivalent to the already existing notions of crossed modules. Roughly speaking, a crossed module in the sense of Leray-Rivi\`ere-Wagemann is an algebra structure on a chain complex concentrated in degrees 0 and 1. We highlight a "codescent" process which allows us to endow the degree one and zero terms of the chain complex with algebra structures such that the differential is an algebra morphism. Moreover, we prove it to be a crossed module. In fact we prove that the approach to crossed modules of Leray-Riviere-Wagemann is equivalent to the one of Janelidze. This new approach, together with the codescent process, allows us to introduce higher crossed modules in a very concise and explicit way, and we prove them to be equivalent to n-fold categories internal to algebras, for some n.</description>

      <title>Synthetic G-jet-structures in modal homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.05966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article constructs the moduli stack of torsionfree $G$-jet-structures in homotopy type theory with one monadic modality. This yields a construction of this moduli stack for any $\infty$-topos equipped with any stable factorization systems.
  In the intended applications of this theory, the factorization systems are given by the deRham-Stack construction. Homotopy type theory allows a formulation of this abstract theory with surprising low complexity. This is witnessed by the accompanying formalization of large parts of this work.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Diversity: The Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book brings new mathematical rigour to the ongoing vigorous debate on how to quantify biological diversity. The question "what is diversity?" has surprising mathematical depth, and breadth too: this book involves parts of mathematics ranging from information theory, functional equations and probability theory to category theory, geometric measure theory and number theory. It applies the power of the axiomatic method to a biological problem of pressing concern, but the new concepts and theorems are also motivated from a purely mathematical perspective.
  The main narrative thread requires no more than an undergraduate course in analysis. No familiarity with entropy or diversity is assumed.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for $\lambda$-calculi and Functional Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This tutorial gives an advanced introduction to string diagrams and graph languages for higher-order computation. The subject matter develops in a principled way, starting from the two dimensional syntax of key categorical concepts such as functors, adjunctions, and strictification, and leading up to Cartesian Closed Categories, the core mathematical model of the lambda calculus and of functional programming languages. This methodology inverts the usual approach of proceeding from syntax to a categorical interpretation, by rationally reconstructing a syntax from the categorical model. The result is a graph syntax -- more precisely, a hierarchical hypergraph syntax -- which in many ways is shown to be an improvement over the conventional linear term syntax. The rest of the tutorial focuses on applications of interest to programming languages: operational semantics, general frameworks for type inference, and complex whole-program transformations such as closure conversion and automatic differentiation.</description>
