      <title>Inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_s$ meson: A first-principles lattice QCD calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_s$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation using the gauge ensembles produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with dynamical light, strange and charm quarks with physical masses and employed the so-called Hansen-Lupo-Tantalo (HLT) method to extract the decay rate and the first two lepton-energy moments from the relevant Euclidean correlators. We have carefully taken into account all sources of systematic errors, including the ones associated with the continuum and infinite-volume extrapolations and with the HLT spectral reconstruction method. We obtained results in very good agreement with the currently available experimental determinations and with a total accuracy at the few-percent level, of the same order of magnitude of the experimental error. Our total error is dominated by the lattice QCD simulations statistical uncertainties and is certainly improvable. From the results presented and thoroughly discussed in this paper we conclude that it is nowadays possible to study heavy mesons inclusive semileptonic decays on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy. The phenomenological implications of our physical results are the subject of a companion letter [1].</description>

      <title>Inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_{s}$ meson: Lattice QCD confronts experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_{s}$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation by taking into account all sources of systematic errors. A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation, demonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a companion paper [1]. Here we focus on the phenomenological implications of our results. Using the current best estimates of the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions for the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that, while the inclusive $D_{s}$ channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive channels in the $|V_{cs}|$ determination, the situation can be significantly improved in the near future.</description>

      <title>Scaling behaviors at quantum and classical first-order transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08238v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum and classical first-order transitions, at equilibrium and under out-of-equilibrium conditions, mainly focusing on quench and slow quasi-adiabatic protocols. For these phenomena, we review the finite-size scaling theory appropriate to describe the general features of the large-scale, and long-time for dynamic phenomena, behavior of finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the semileptonic $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition within QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct an investigation on the spin $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$ semileptonic weak transition of single heavy baryons for the exclusive decay $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in three possible lepton channels within the three point QCD sum rule method. We compute the responsible form factors of this semileptonic decay by incorporating both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions of the operator product expansion series up to a mass dimension six. Having acquired the form factors, the decay widths of the processes in all lepton channels are determined. Our findings as well as possible future experimental information can be employed in order to check the SM predictions and explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>

      <title>Confined but chirally and chiral spin symmetric hot matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the quark--antiquark mesons at zero and finite temperature in the framework of a solvable chirally symmetric quark model with linear confining potential. The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'').</description>

      <title>$P$-wave charmonium contribution to hidden-charm states from reanalysis of lattice QCD data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze, considering the contribution of $P$-wave charmonia, lattice data for the $D \bar{D}$-$D_s\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel of S. Prelovsek et al. [JHEP 06, 035 (2021)] and $D\bar{D}^*$ systems of S. Prelovsek et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 192001 (2013)] with $m_{\pi}\simeq 280$ and $266$ MeV, and $L=24a/32a$ ($a\simeq 0.09$ fm) and $L=16a$ ($a\simeq0.1239(13)$ fm), respectively. The hidden-charm states with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{++}$, and $2^{++}$ quantum numbers are then searched for. For $0^{++}$, the analysis reveals three poles in the $D\bar{D}$-$D_s\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel amplitude, corresponding to three states. Two of these poles, located near the $D\bar{D}$ and $D_s\bar{D}_s$ thresholds, can be interpreted as mostly molecular states. A third pole above the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ threshold is originated from the $P$-wave $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state. The number of poles found in the $D\bar D$-$D_s \bar D_s$ system is the same as that found in the original lattice analysis though the position of the third pole changes sizeably. In the $1^{++}$ sector, we find two poles in the complex energy plane. The first one is related to the molecular $X(3872)$ state, with a compositeness exceeding $90\%$, while the second one, stemming from the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ charmonium, appears above the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold and it likely corresponds to the recently discovered $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ state. In the $2^{++}$ sector, we also report two poles and find that the dressed $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ is lighter than the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ molecular state, with the dynamics of the latter closely related to that of the heavy-quark spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$. Our exploratory study of the $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ sectors offers valuable insights into their dynamics, but given that the fits that we carry out are underconstrained, more lattice data are required to draw robust conclusions.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.</description>
