      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum machine learning (QML) emerges as a promising field at the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, it becomes crucial to address the biases and challenges that arise from the unique nature of quantum systems. This research includes work on identification, diagnosis, and response to biases in Quantum Machine Learning. This paper aims to provide an overview of three key topics: How does bias unique to Quantum Machine Learning look? Why and how can it occur? What can and should be done about it?</description>

      <title>Exact solution for Dicke superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution for the time evolution of an initially inverted ensemble of identical $N$ two-level quantum emitters, i.e. to the Dicke superradiance problem. It is asumed that the system undergoes collective decay with a symmetric collapse operator, thus reducing the time evolution of the density operator to the fully symmetric subspace spanned by $N+1$ Dicke states. In this collective basis, the system relaxes from the fully excited state to the zero excitation ground state as a full mixture of Dicke states. The solution derived here is exact for any value of $N$ and any time time $t$ during the evolution.</description>

      <title>Parallel Quantum Signal Processing Via Polynomial Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a methodology for constructing polynomial transformations of a linear operator encoded in a unitary. Applied to an encoding of a state $\rho$, QSP enables the evaluation of nonlinear functions of the form $\text{tr}(P(\rho))$ for a polynomial $P(x)$, which encompasses relevant properties like entropies and fidelity. However, QSP is a sequential algorithm: implementing a degree-$d$ polynomial necessitates $d$ queries to the encoding, equating to a query depth $d$. Here, we reduce the depth of these property estimation algorithms by developing Parallel Quantum Signal Processing. Our algorithm parallelizes the computation of $\text{tr} (P(\rho))$ over $k$ systems and reduces the query depth to $d/k$, thus enabling a family of time-space tradeoffs for QSP. This furnishes a property estimation algorithm suitable for distributed quantum computers, and is realized at the expense of increasing the number of measurements by a factor $O( \text{poly}(d) 2^{O(k)} )$. We achieve this result by factorizing $P(x)$ into a product of $k$ smaller polynomials of degree $O(d/k)$, which are each implemented in parallel with QSP, and subsequently multiplied together with a swap test to reconstruct $P(x)$. We characterize the achievable class of polynomials by appealing to the fundamental theorem of algebra, and demonstrate application to canonical problems including entropy estimation and partition function evaluation.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of an Optical Polarization State in a Polarization-Selective Nonlinear Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit polarization self-rotation in atomic rubidium vapor to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking and bistability of polarization patterns. We pump the vapor cell with horizontally polarized light while the vertical polarization, which is initially in the vacuum state, is resonated in a ring cavity. Vacuum fluctuations in this mode experience cumulative gain due to the compound action of amplification due to the self-rotation and feedback through the resonator, eventually acquiring a macroscopic magnitude akin to an optical parametric oscillator. The randomness of these fluctuations results in a bistable, random macroscopic polarization pattern at the output. We propose utilizing this mechanism to simulate Ising-like interaction between multiple spatial modes and as a basis for a fully optical coherent Ising machine.</description>

      <title>Local Counterdiabatic Driving for Jaynes-Cummings Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jaynes-Cummings (JC) lattices can be constructed by connecting quantum two-level systems with cavities and have been widely studied for polariton many-body states and multipartite entanglement. Although adiabatic evolution has been studied for the generation of many-body states in this system, its reliance on long timescales can lead to serious decoherence. Here we present a scheme that utilizes local counterdiabatic (CD) driving to provide fast and high-fidelity state preparation in JC lattices. The exact CD Hamiltonian for this system contains nonlocal couplings between qubits and cavities at different and distant sites, which causes a challenge in the implementation. Leveraging the symmetries of the eigenstates under both periodic and open boundary conditions, we derive a local CD Hamiltonian that generates the same dynamics as the exact CD Hamiltonian and our numerical simulations confirm this result. We also show that a multipartite W-state can be prepared with high fidelity using this method. The implementation and decoherence of this scheme with superconducting quantum devices are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Particle approximations of Wigner distributions for n arbitrary observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of signed joint probability measures for n arbitrary quantum observables is derived and studied based on quasi-characteristic functions with symmetrized operator orderings of Margenau-Hill type. It is shown that the Wigner distribution associated with these observables can be rigorously approximated by such measures. These measures are given by affine combinations of Dirac delta distributions supported over the finite spectral range of the quantum observables and give the correct probability marginals when coarse-grained along any principal axis. We specialize to bivariate quasi-probability distributions for the spin measurements of spin-1/2 particles and derive their closed-form expressions. As a side result, we point out a connection between the convergence of these particle approximations and the Mehler-Heine theorem. Finally, we interpret the supports of these quasi-probability distributions in terms of repeated thought experiments.</description>

      <title>The controlled exciton transport of the Multi-chain system by cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accomplished functions of a variety of quantum devices are closely associated with the controlling of exciton transport. To this end we study the exciton transport of the two-dimensional system consisting of two-level multichains with various coupling configurations in a cavity. Two types of the chains are considered, including Tavis-Cummings and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain. Two conformations of the coupling between chains are considered, including square and triangle type. The effects of the inter-chain coupling, dimerization parameter, the cavity, the length of chains, and the number of chains on the exciton transport are in detail investigated for different coupling configurations of the multi-chain system through spectra and steady-state dynamics. The results show that in the absence of a cavity the exciton transport effciency is decided by the distribution of population of exciton on whole chains. However, when the cavity is considered the exciton transport currents and effciency of the system is controlled by the cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings near zero-energy modes, at which the coherent excitation and Landau-Zener transitions occur. Therefore, the exciton transport can be enhanced or suppressed at the crossings and anticrossings, in which the polariton acts as crucial role. Besides, it is discovered that the exciton transport effciency is closely related with the parity of both the length and the number of chains. This work is important for the understanding of the exciton transport mechanism in the multichain-cavity system, and provides theoretical basis for excitonic devices with controllable and effcient exciton transport.</description>

      <title>Coherence analysis of local randomness and nonlocal correlation through polarization-basis projections of entangled photon pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photon pairs generated from second-order nonlinear optical media have been extensively studied for both fundamental research and potential applications of quantum information. In spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), quantum entanglement between paired photons, often regarded as mysterious, has been demonstrated for local randomness and nonlocal correlation through polarization-basis projections using linear optics (Phys. Rev. A 60, R773 (1999)). This paper presents a coherence analysis of these established quantum phenomena with polarization control of the paired photons and their projection measurements. First, we analyze the quantum superposition of photon pairs generated randomly from cross-sandwiched nonlinear media, focusing on local randomness, which depends on the incoherence among measured events. Second, we investigate coincidence detection between paired photons to understand the nonlocal correlation arising from independently controlled remote parameters, resulting in an inseparable product-basis relationship. This coherence-based approach sheds light on a deterministic perspective on quantum features, emphasizing the significance of phase information intrinsic to the wave nature of photons.</description>

      <title>Reliable Interval Estimation for the Fidelity of Entangled States in Scenarios with General Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity estimation for entangled states constitutes an essential building block for quality control and error detection in quantum networks. Nonetheless, quantum networks often encounter heterogeneous and correlated noise, leading to excessive uncertainty in the estimated fidelity. In this paper, the uncertainty associated with the estimated fidelity under conditions of general noise is constrained by jointly employing random sampling, a thought experiment, and Bayesian inference, resulting in a credible interval for fidelity that is valid in the presence of general noise. The proposed credible interval incorporates all even moments of the posterior distribution to enhance estimation accuracy. Factors influencing the estimation accuracy are identified and analyzed. Specifically, the issue of excessive measurements is addressed, emphasizing the necessity of properly determining the measurement ratio for fidelity estimation under general noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum delegated and federated learning via quantum homomorphic encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum learning models hold the potential to bring computational advantages over the classical realm. As powerful quantum servers become available on the cloud, ensuring the protection of clients' private data becomes crucial. By incorporating quantum homomorphic encryption schemes, we present a general framework that enables quantum delegated and federated learning with a computation-theoretical data privacy guarantee. We show that learning and inference under this framework feature substantially lower communication complexity compared with schemes based on blind quantum computing. In addition, in the proposed quantum federated learning scenario, there is less computational burden on local quantum devices from the client side, since the server can operate on encrypted quantum data without extracting any information. We further prove that certain quantum speedups in supervised learning carry over to private delegated learning scenarios employing quantum kernel methods. Our results provide a valuable guide toward privacy-guaranteed quantum learning on the cloud, which may benefit future studies and security-related applications.</description>

      <title>Device-independent full network nonlocality for arbitrary-party and unbounded-input scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlocality arising in a multi-party network involving multiple independent sources radically differs from the standard multipartite Bell nonlocality involving a single source. The notion of the full network nonlocality (FNN) (Phys. Rev. Lett.128, 010403 (2022)) characterizes the quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced by a local-nonlocal model featuring one local source and the rest of nonlocal no-signaling sources. However, the demonstration of FNN was limited to bilocal and trilocal star-shaped network scenarios involving three or two dichotomic measurements for edge parties. In this paper, we first demonstrate that a large class of prevailing network inequalities does not exhibit FNN. We then introduce an elegant set of arbitrary-party and unbounded-input network inequalities in star-shaped and linear-chain networks whose optimal quantum violation exhibits FNN, certifying that the nonlocality is genuinely distributed to the entire network. Contrasting to existing demonstrations of FNN that inevitably require fixed-input and four-output elegant joint measurements for the central party, our generalized inequalities are more experimentally friendly, requiring only two-output measurements. Moreover, our derivation of optimal quantum violation is fully analytic and devoid of assuming the dimension of the quantum system, thereby showcasing its potential for device-independent self-testing.</description>

      <title>Achieving 5 % $^{13}$C nuclear spin hyperpolarization in high-purity diamond at room temperature and low field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically polarizable nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond enables the hyperpolarization of $^{13}$C nuclear spins at low magnetic field and room temperature. However, achieving a high level of polarization comparable to conventional dynamic nuclear polarization has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate that, at below 10 mT, a $^{13}$C polarization of 5 % can be obtained, equivalent to an enhancement ratio over $7 \times 10^6$. We used high-purity diamond with a low initial nitrogen concentration ($&lt;$ 1 ppm), which also results in a long storage time exceeding 100 minutes. By aligning the magnetic field along [100], the number of NV spins participating in polarization transfer increases fourfold. We conducted a comprehensive optimization of field intensity and microwave (MW) frequency-sweep parameters for this field orientation. The optimum MW sweep width suggests that polarization transfer occurs primarily to bulk $^{13}$C spins through the integrated solid effect followed by nuclear spin diffusion.</description>

      <title>Quantum superposing algorithm for quantum encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient encoding of classical data into quantum state -- currently referred to as quantum encoding -- holds crucial significance in quantum computation. For finite-size databases and qubit registers, a common strategy of the quantum encoding entails establishing a classical mapping that correlates machine-recognizable data addresses with qubit indices that are subsequently superposed. Herein, the most imperative lies in casting an algorithm for generating the superposition of any given number of qubit indices. This algorithm is formally known as quantum superposing algorithm. In this work, we present an efficient quantum superposing algorithm, affirming its effectiveness and superior computational performance in a practical quantum encoding scenario. Our theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate a substantial enhancement in computational efficiency compared to existing algorithms. Notably, our algorithm has a maximum of 2n-3 controlled-not (CNOT) counts, representing the most optimized result to date.</description>

      <title>Improved postselection security analysis of phase error estimation in quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the generation of secure keys between two distant users. Security proof of QKD against general coherent attacks is challenging, while the one against collective attacks is much easier. As an effective and general solution, the postselection method tries to extend security analyses of collective attacks to be against coherent attacks. However, it gives a bad performance. To overcome this drawback, instead of directly calculating key rate by postselection method, we propose a method correlating the failure probabilities of phase error estimation against collective and coherent attacks, enabling the use of the independent and identically distributed assumption in parameter estimation against coherent attacks. Then the key rate can be obtained by uncertainty relation of entropy. Our method can be applied to various QKD protocols, providing better performance compared with the traditional postselection method. For instance, we give the finite-key analyses of the side-channel-secure (SCS) QKD and the no-phase-postselection (NPP) twin-field (TF) QKD to show their performance improvements with the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Particle Statistics in Classical Shallow Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new hydrodynamic analogy of nonrelativistic quantum particles in potential wells. Similarities between a real variant of the Schr\"odinger equation and gravity-capillary shallow water waves are reported and analyzed. We show that when locally oscillating particles are guided by real wave gradients, particles may exhibit trajectories of alternating periodic or chaotic dynamics while increasing the wave potential. The particle probability distribution function of this analogy reveals the quantum statistics of the standard solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation and thus manifests as a classical deterministic interpretation of Born's rule. Finally, a classical mechanism for the transition between quasi-stationary states is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in fundamental tests and practical applications of quantum mechanics. Because entanglement is a feature unique to quantum systems, its observation provides evidence of the quantum nature on the system. Hence, if gravity can generate entanglement between quantum superpositions, this indicates that quantum amplitudes are field sources and gravity is a quantum phenomenon. I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers proposed to test the quantum nature of gravity and show that the Pancharatnam phase displays features that provide a qualitative distinction between semiclassical and quantum signatures of gravity. The semiclassical evolution of the system is equivalent to that of a single interferometer (a two-level system) in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution of the superposition in the Bloch sphere. In contrast, in the quantum case, the two interferometers are coupled (two two-level systems) and I find that the phase is continuous.</description>

      <title>Dark-state engineering in Fock-state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fock-state lattices (FSLs) are becoming an emerging research hotspot in quantum physics, not only because the FSLs provide a new perspective for studying atom-field interactions, but also because they build the connection between quantum optics and condensed matter physics. Owing to the multiple transition paths in the lattices, inherent quantum interference effect exists in these systems, and hence how to find new quantum coherent phenomena and exploit their applications becomes a significant and desired task in this field. In this work, we study the dark-state effect in the FSLs generated by the multimode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) models. By considering the FSLs in certain-excitation-number subspaces, we study the dark states with respect to the states associated with the atomic excited state using the arrowhead-matrix method. We find that there exist dark-state subspaces with the dimensions determined by the number of orthogonal dark states. When the dimension is larger than one, the forms of these dark-state bases are not unique. Further, we obtain the number and form of the orthogonal dark states in the two-, three-, and four-mode JC models. In addition, we find that for a general $N$-mode JC model, there are $C_{N+n-2}^{N-2}$ orthogonal dark states in the $n$-excitation subspace. We also build the relationship between the dark modes and dark states. Our work will pave the way for exploring quantum optical effects and quantum information processing based on the FSLs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Verification of Stabilizer Code Subspaces with Local Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the task of verifying whether a quantum computer, designed to be protected by a specific stabilizer code, correctly encodes the corresponding logical qubits. To achieve this, we develop a general framework for subspace verification and explore several stabilizer code subspaces of practical significance. First, we present two efficient verification strategies for general stabilizer code subspaces, utilizing measurements of their stabilizer generators and stabilizer groups, respectively. Then, building on the observation that certain tests can be conducted in parallel when the subspace exhibits specific structural properties, we propose a coloring strategy tailored to graph code subspaces and an XZ strategy tailored to Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code subspaces. Compared to stabilizer-based strategies, these new strategies require significantly fewer measurement settings and consume fewer state copies, approaching near-global optimality. Notably, all the strategies employ a limited number of Pauli measurements, are non-adaptive, and work on mixed states, enabling efficient experimental certification of both logical qubits and logical operations in noisy quantum computers. This work contributes to the first systematic study of efficient verification of stabilizer code subspaces with local measurements.</description>

      <title>ANN-Enhanced Detection of Multipartite Entanglement in a Three-Qubit NMR Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an artificial neural network (ANN) model to identify the entanglement class of an experimentally generated three-qubit pure state drawn from one of the six inequivalent classes under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). The ANN model is also able to detect the presence of genuinely multipartite entanglement (GME) in the state. We apply data science techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, which corresponds to a reduction in the number of required density matrix elements to be computed. The ANN model is first trained on a simulated dataset containing randomly generated states, and is later tested and validated on noisy experimental three-qubit states cast in the canonical form and generated on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We benchmark the ANN model via Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms and compare the results of our ANN-based entanglement classification with existing three-qubit SLOCC entanglement classification schemes such as 3-tangle and correlation tensors. Our results demonstrate that the ANN model can perform GME detection and SLOCC class identification with high accuracy, using a priori knowledge of only a few density matrix elements as inputs. Since the ANN model works well with a reduced input dataset, it is an attractive method for entanglement classification in real-life situations with limited experimental data sets.</description>

      <title>Probing Lambda-Gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a novel detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of table-top experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately two orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by two orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment could establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behaviour of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a novel means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a variant of communication tasks, players cooperate in choosing their local strategies to compute a given task later, working separately. Utilizing quantum bits for communication and sharing entanglement between parties is a recognized method to enhance performance in these situations. In this work, we introduce the game for which three parties, Alice, Bob and Charlie, would like to discover the hidden order in which they make the moves. We show the advantage of quantum strategies that use shared entanglement and local operations over classical setups for discriminating operations' composition order. The role of quantum resources improving the probability of successful discrimination is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Classification of dynamical Lie algebras generated by spin interactions on undirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a classification of all dynamical Lie algebras generated by 2-local spin interactions on undirected graphs. Building on our previous work where we provided such a classification for spin chains, here we consider the more general case of undirected graphs. As it turns out, the one-dimensional case is special; for any other graph, the dynamical Lie algebra solely depends on whether the graph is bipartite or not. An important consequence of this result is that the cases where the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in size are special and restricted to one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing architecture matures, it is important to investigate new technologies that lend unique advantages. In this work, we propose, Qompose, a neutral atom quantum computing framework for efficiently composing quantum circuits on 2-D topologies of neutral atoms. Qompose selects an efficient topology for any given circuit in order to optimize for length of execution through efficient parallelism and for overall fidelity. our extensive evaluation demonstrates the Qompose is effective for a large collection of randomly-generated quantum circuits and a range of real-world benchmarks including VQE, ISING, and QAOA.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Resistant Photonic Hash Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum hash function based on Gaussian boson sampling on a photonic quantum computer, aiming to provide quantum-resistant security. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this hash function exhibits strong properties of preimage, second preimage, and collision resistance, which are essential for cryptographic applications. Notably, the estimated number of attempts required for a successful collision attack increases exponentially with the mode counts of the photonic quantum computer, suggesting robust resistance against birthday attacks. We also analyze the sampling cost for physical implementation and discuss potential applications to blockchain technologies, where the inherent quantum nature of the hash computation could provide quantum-resistant security. The high dimensionality of the quantum state space involved in the hashing process poses significant challenges for quantum attacks, indicating a path towards quantum security. Our work lays the foundation for a new paradigm of quantum-resistant hashing with applications in emerging quantum-era information systems.</description>

      <title>Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with a Parametric Superconducting Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a supercondicting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting a finite-component phase transition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant work has been done to develop quantum satellites, which generate entangled pairs in space and distribute them to ground stations separated some distance away. The reverse uplink case, where pairs are generated on the ground and swapped on the satellite using an optical Bell-measurement, has not been seriously considered due to a prevailing assumption that it is practically infeasible. In this letter, we illustrate the feasibility of performing Discrete Variable photonic Bell-measurements in space by conducting a detailed numerical analysis to estimate the channel efficiency and attainable pair fidelity for various satellite-station configurations. Our model accounts for a wide range of physical effects such as atmospheric effects, stray photons, and mode mismatch. Our findings show promise toward the feasibility of photonic Bell-measurements in space, which motivates future research towards large-scale Satellite-based uplink entanglement distribution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of quantum sensing has garnered increasing attention due to its potential to revolutionize various scientific and technological domains. Among the different quantum sensors, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond stands out for its ease of use, ability to be read out and initialized with a laser, and long coherence times even at room temperature. Over the past years, numerous quantum control sequences have been developed to successfully deploy NV sensors in diverse situations, such as measuring nearby spin clusters, classical AC signals, and static magnetic fields. However, the NV center faces limitations when coupling to high frequency signals. More specifically, as the frequency of the target signal increases, stronger driving fields over NVs are needed, ultimately reaching the limits of current experimental capabilities. In this thesis, we propose several protocols to address this high-frequency problem in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computing with a single arbitrary gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a roadmap towards utilizing a single arbitrary gate for universal quantum computing. Since two decades ago, it has been widely accepted that almost any single arbitrary gate with qubit number $&gt;2$ is universal. Utilizing a single arbitrary gate for compiling is beneficial for systems with limited degrees of freedom, e.g. the scattering based quantum computing schemes. However, how to efficiently compile the wanted gate with a single arbitrary gate, and finally achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing is unknown. In this work, we show almost any target gate can be compiled to precision $\epsilon$ with a circuit depth of approximately $\log(\epsilon^{-1})$ with an improved brute-force compiling method. Under the assumption of reasonable classical resource, we show the gate imperfection can be lowered to $10^{-3}$. By treating the imperfection as coherent error, we show that the error can be further reduced by roughly two orders of magnitude with a measurement-free quantum error correction method.</description>

Abstract: After the NP-hardness of computational problems such as 3SAT and MaxCut was established, a natural next step was to explore whether these problems remain hard to approximate. While the quantum extensions of some of these problems are known to be hard-indeed undecidable-their inapproximability remains largely unresolved. In this work, we introduce definitions for the quantum extensions of Label-Cover and Unique-Label-Cover. We show that these problems play a similarly crucial role in studying the inapproximability of quantum constraint satisfaction problems as they do in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Learning Parameterized Quantum Circuits with Quantum Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are crucial for quantum machine learning and circuit synthesis, enabling the practical implementation of complex quantum tasks. However, PQC learning has been largely confined to classical optimization methods, which suffer from issues like gradient vanishing. In this work, we introduce a nested optimization model that leverages quantum gradient to enhance PQC learning for polynomial-type cost functions. Our approach utilizes quantum algorithms to identify and overcome a type of gradient vanishing-a persistent challenge in PQC learning-by effectively navigating the optimization landscape. We also mitigate potential barren plateaus of our model and manage the learning cost via restricting the optimization region. Numerically, we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on two tasks: the Max-Cut problem and polynomial optimization. The method excels in generating circuits without gradient vanishing and effectively optimizes the cost function. From the perspective of quantum algorithms, our model improves quantum optimization for polynomial-type cost functions, addressing the challenge of exponential sample complexity growth.</description>

      <title>Local contextuality-based self-tests are sufficient for randomness expansion secure against quantum adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum cryptography, secure randomness expansion involves using a short private string of random bits to generate a longer one, even in the presence of an adversary who may have access to quantum resources. In this work, we demonstrate that local contextuality-based self-tests are sufficient to construct a randomness expansion protocol that is secure against computationally unbounded quantum adversaries. Our protocol is based on self-testing from non-contextuality inequalities and we prove that our scheme asymptotically produces secure random numbers which are $\mathcal{O}(m\sqrt{\epsilon})$-close to uniformly distributed and private, where $\epsilon$ is the robustness parameter of the self-test and $m$ is the length of the generated random bit string. Our protocol is semi-device-independent in the sense that it inherits any assumptions necessary for the underlying self-test.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fast Implementation of Private Information Retrieval and Functional Bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation has found greater efficiency and security across various fields. We show that, in a near-term hybrid cloud computing scenario with only one single quantum server and an entirely classical client, critical bottlenecks in privacy-preserving computation can be addressed.
  First, we propose an efficient quantum functional bootstrapping algorithm with a runtime polynomial in the plaintext-size, providing an exponential quantum speedup over classical algorithms. Second, we present a secure and fast quantum private information retrieval protocol with logarithmic query time. The security relies on the learning with errors (LWE) problem with polynomial modulus, greatly improving the security of classical fast PIR protocol based on ring-LWE with super-polynomial modulus.
  Technically, we extend an important classical homomorphic operation, known as blind rotation, to the quantum case by an encrypted conditional rotation technique. This technique holds promise for broader applications in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalization of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</description>

      <title>Tunable photon scattering by qubit-photon bound states in a photonic crystal waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters trapped near photonic crystal waveguides have recently emerged as an exciting platform for realizing novel quantum matter-light interfaces. Here we study tunable photon scattering in a photonic crystal waveguide coupled to a pair of two-level atoms with an arbitrary spatial separation. In the weak-excitation regime, we give the energy levels and their decay rates into the waveguide modes in the dressed basis, which both depend on the distance between the two atoms. We focus on the Bragg case and anti-Bragg case, where subradiant and superradiant states are produced and perfect transmission with a $\pi$ phase shift may occur on resonance. We observe quantum beats in the photon-photon correlation function of the reflected field in the anti-Bragg case. Moreover, the frequencies of quantum beats can be controlled due to the tunability of the bound states via the dispersion engineering of the structure. We also quantify the effects of the system imperfections, including the deviation in the distance between the two atoms and the asymmetry in the atomic decay rates into the waveguide modes. With recent experimental advances in the superconducting microwave transmission lines, our results should soon be realizable.</description>

      <title>Teleportation fidelity of quantum repeater networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities between all pairs of nodes in a large quantum repeater network is a measure of the resourcefulness of the network as a whole. We use simple Werner state-based models to characterise some fundamental (loopless) topologies (star, chain, and some trees) with respect to this measure in three (semi)realistic scenarios. Most of our results are analytic and are applicable for arbitrary network sizes. We identify the parameter ranges where these networks can achieve quantum advantages and show the large-N behaviours.</description>

      <title>Satellite image classification with neural quantum kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A practical application of quantum machine learning in real-world scenarios in the short term remains elusive, despite significant theoretical efforts. Image classification, a common task for classical models, has been used to benchmark quantum algorithms with simple datasets, but only few studies have tackled complex real-data classification challenges. In this work, we address such a gap by focusing on the classification of satellite images, a task of particular interest to the earth observation (EO) industry. We first preprocess the selected intrincate dataset by reducing its dimensionality. Subsequently, we employ neural quantum kernels (NQKs)- embedding quantum kernels (EQKs) constructed from trained quantum neural networks (QNNs)- to classify images which include solar panels. We explore both $1$-to-$n$ and $n$-to-$n$ NQKs. In the former, parameters from a single-qubit QNN's training construct an $n$-qubit EQK achieving a mean test accuracy over 86% with three features. In the latter, we iteratively train an $n$-qubit QNN to ensure scalability, using the resultant architecture to directly form an $n$-qubit EQK. In this case, a test accuracy over 88% is obtained for three features and 8 qubits. Additionally, we show that the results are robust against a suboptimal training of the QNN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose simple quantitative criteria, based on counting statistics in resonant harmonic detectors, that probe the quantum mechanical character of radiation fields. They provide, in particular, practical means to test the null hypothesis that a given field is ``maximally classical'', i.e., accurately described by a coherent state. We suggest circumstances in which that hypothesis plausibly fails, notably including gravitational radiation involving non-linear or stochastic sourcing.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal-state-based Measurement Device Independent Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to propose the first orthogonal-state-based protocols of measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication and quantum dialogue employing single basis, i.e., Bell basis as decoy qubits for eavesdropping detection. Orthogonal-state-based protocols are inherently distinct from conventional conjugate-coding protocols, offering unconditional security derived from the duality and monogamy of entanglement. Notably, these orthogonal-state-based protocols demonstrate improved performance over conjugate-coding based protocols under certain noisy environments, highlighting the significance of selecting the best basis choice of decoy qubits for secure quantum communication under collective noise. Furthermore, we rigorously analyze the security of the proposed protocols against various eavesdropping strategies, including intercept-and-resend attack, entangle-and-measure attack, information leakage attack, flip attack, and disturbance or modification attack. Our findings also show that, with appropriate modifications, the proposed orthogonal-state-based measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication protocol can be transformed into orthogonal-state-based measurement-device-independent versions of quantum key distribution protocols, expanding their applicability. Our protocols leverage fundamentally distinct resources to close the security loopholes linked to measurement devices, while also effectively doubling the distance for secure direct message transmission compared to traditional quantum communication methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory and experiment have long discussed negative thermodynamic pressure states, but their microscopic origins are unclear. I address this problem within the framework of quantum thermodynamics. I show that the pressure exerted on the boundary is positive when there is no interaction with the boundary. This is formalized via a no-go theorem that holds for any quantum state. It is believed that stable negative pressure states cannot exist in gases. I provide solvable examples of quantum and classical gases, where negative pressure is achieved due to a suitable coupling with the boundary walls.</description>

      <title>Single-atom dissipation and dephasing in Dicke and Tavis-Cummings quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of single-atom dissipation and dephasing noise on the performance of Dicke and Tavis-Cummings quantum batteries, where the electromagnetic field of the cavity hosting the system acts as a charger. For these models a genuine charging process can only occur in the transient regime. Indeed, unless the interaction with the environment is cut off, the asymptotic energy of the battery is solely determined by the environment and does not depend on the initial energy of the electromagnetic field. We numerically estimate the fundamental figures of merit for the model, including the time at which the battery reaches its maximum ergotropy, the average energy, and the energy that needs to be used to switch the battery-charger interaction on and off. Depending on the scaling of the coupling between the battery and the charger, we show that the model can still exhibit a subextensive charging time. However, for the Dicke battery, this effect comes with a higher cost when switching the battery-charger interaction on and off. We also show that as the number of battery constituents increases, both the Dicke and Tavis-Cummings models become asymptotically free, meaning the amount of energy that is not unitarily extractable becomes negligible. We obtain this result numerically and demonstrate analytically that it is a consequence of the symmetry under permutation of the model. Finally, we perform simulations for different values of the detuning, showing that the optimal regime for the Dicke battery is off-resonance, in contrast to what is observed in the Tavis-Cummings case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory is notoriously counterintuitive, and yet remains entirely self-consistent when applied universally. Here we uncover a new manifestation of its unusual consequences. We demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally (by means of polarization-encoded single-photon qubits), that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle leads to the impossibility of stringing together logical deductions about outcomes of consecutive non-compatible measurements. This phenomenon resembles the geometry of a Penrose triangle, where each corner is locally consistent while the global structure is impossible. Besides this, we show how overlooking this non-trivial logical structure leads to the erroneous possibility of distinguishing non-orthogonal states with a single measurement.</description>

      <title>Randomness from Radiation: Evaluation and Analysis of Radiation-Based Random Number Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random numbers are central to various applications such as secure communications, quantum key distribution theory (QKD), statistics, and other tasks. One of today's most popular generators is quantum random numbers (QRNGs). The inherent randomness and true unpredictability in quantum mechanics allowed us to construct QRNGs that are more accurate and useful than traditional random number generators. Based on different quantum mechanical principles, several QRNGs have already been designed. The primary focus of this paper is the generation and analysis of quantum random numbers based on radioactive decay. In the experimental set, two beta-active radioactive sources, cobalt-60 (Co60) and Strontium-90 (Sr 90), and an ST-360 counter with a Geiger-Muller (GM) tube are used to record the counts. The recorded data was then self-tested by entropy and frequency measurement. Moreover, popular testing technique, the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) randomness testing is used, to ensure that the guaranteed randomness meets security standards. The research provides the impact of the nature of the radioactive source, the distance between the counter and sources, and the recording time of the counts on generating quantum random numbers of radioactive QRNGs.</description>

      <title>Creating Automated Quantum-Assisted Solutions for Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When trying to use quantum-enhanced methods for optimization problems, the sheer number of options inhibits its adoption by industrial end users. Expert knowledge is required for the formulation and encoding of the use case, the selection and adaptation of the algorithm, and the identification of a suitable quantum computing backend. Navigating the decision tree spanned by these options is a difficult task and supporting integrated tools are still missing. We propose the QuaST decision tree, a framework that allows to explore, automate and systematically evaluate solution paths. It helps end users to transfer research to their application area, and researchers to gather experience with real-world use cases. Our setup is modular, highly structured and flexible enough to include any kind of preparation, pre-processing and post-processing steps. We develop the guiding principles for the design of the ambitious framework and discuss its implementation. The QuaST decision tree includes multiple complete top-down paths from an application to its fully hybrid quantum solution.</description>

      <title>A Compact Quantum Random Number Generator Based on Balanced Detection of Shot Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Number Generators are critical components of modern cryptosystems. Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) have emerged to provide high-quality randomness for these applications. Here we describe a scheme to extract random numbers using balanced detection of shot noise from an LED in a commercially available off-the-shelf package. The balanced detection minimizes classical noise contributions from the optical field, improving the isolation of the quantum noise. We present a detailed description and analyze the performance of a QRNG that can be easily integrated into existing systems without the requirement of custom components. The design is optimised for manufacturability, cost, and size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a computational approach designed to leverage quantum fluctuations for solving large-scale classical optimization problems. Although incorporating standard transverse field (TF) terms in the annealing process can help navigate sharp minima, the potential for achieving a scalable quantum advantage for general optimization problems remains uncertain. Here, we examine the effectiveness of including chaotic quantum driver Hamiltonians in the annealing dynamics. Specifically, we investigate driver Hamiltonians based on a bosonic spin version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which features a high degree of non-locality and non-commutativity. Focusing on MaxCut instances on regular graphs, we find that a considerable proportion of SYK model instances demonstrate significant speedups, especially for challenging graph configurations. Additionally, our analysis of time-to-solution scalings for the low autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem suggests that SYK-type fluctuations can outperform traditional transverse field annealing schedules in large-scale optimization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a subset of the basis for the irreducible representations of the total $SU(2)$ rotation forms a covariant approximate quantum error-correcting code with transversal $U(1)$ logical gates. Using only properties of the angular momentum algebra, we obtain bounds on the code inaccuracy against generic noise on any known $d$ sites and against heralded $d$-local erasures, generalizing and improving previous works on the ``thermodynamic code" to general local spin and different irreducible representations. We demonstrate that this family of codes can host and protect a probe state with quantum Fisher information surpassing the standard quantum limit when the sensing parameter couples to the generator of the $U(1)$ logical gate.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show the robustness of uberholography and its associated quantum error correcting code against the breakdown of entanglement wedge in the presence of highly entropic mixed states in the bulk. We show that for Cantor-set-like erasure in the boundary in $AdS_3/CFT_2$, the code distance is independent of the mixed-state entropy in the bulk in the $m\rightarrow\infty$ limit. We also show that for a Sierpinski triangle shaped boundary subregion with fractal boundary erasures in $AdS_4/CFT_3$, bulk reconstruction is possible in the presence of highly entropic mixed states in the bulk in the large $m$ regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the collective motion of self-propelled agents through the lens of quantum-like entanglement in visual perception. This approach makes the non-linear dynamics in ordinary space a derivative of dynamics in the Hilbert space of perception. By appropriately selecting operators, we demonstrate how this framework can give rise to the well-known Vicsek model. Additionally, we investigate the impact of different types of entangled states, such as GHZ states, W states, and cluster states, on collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Exploring LLM-Driven Explanations for Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Quantum computing is a rapidly growing new programming paradigm that brings significant changes to the design and implementation of algorithms. Understanding quantum algorithms requires knowledge of physics and mathematics, which can be challenging for software developers.
  Aims: In this work, we provide a first analysis of how LLMs can support developers' understanding of quantum code. Method: We empirically analyse and compare the quality of explanations provided by three widely adopted LLMs (Gpt3.5, Llama2, and Tinyllama) using two different human-written prompt styles for seven state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. We also analyse how consistent LLM explanations are over multiple rounds and how LLMs can improve existing descriptions of quantum algorithms.
  Results: Llama2 provides the highest quality explanations from scratch, while Gpt3.5 emerged as the LLM best suited to improve existing explanations. In addition, we show that adding a small amount of context to the prompt significantly improves the quality of explanations. Finally, we observe how explanations are qualitatively and syntactically consistent over multiple rounds.
  Conclusions: This work highlights promising results, and opens challenges for future research in the field of LLMs for quantum code explanation. Future work includes refining the methods through prompt optimisation and parsing of quantum code explanations, as well as carrying out a systematic assessment of the quality of explanations.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Subsystem entropy in 2d CFT and KdV ETH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study subsystem entropy in 2d CFTs, for subsystems constituting a finite fraction of the full system. We focus on the extensive contribution, which scales linearly with the subsystem size in the thermodynamic limit. We employ the so-called diagonal approximation to evaluate subsystem entropy for the chaotic CFTs in thermal state (canonical ensemble), microcanonical ensemble, and in a primary state, matching previously known results. We then proceed to find analytic expressions for the subsystem entropy at leading order in $c$, when the global CFT state is the KdV generalized Gibbs ensemble or the KdV microcanonical ensemble. Previous studies of primary eigenstates have shown that, akin to fixed-area states in AdS/CFT, corresponding subsystem entanglement spectrum is flat. This behavior is seemingly in sharp contradiction with the one for the thermal (microcanonical) state, and thus in apparent contradiction with the subsystem Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). In this work, we resolve this issue by comparing the primary state with the KdV (micro)canonical ensemble. We show that the results are consistent with the KdV-generalized version of the subsystem ETH, in which local properties of quantum eigenstates are governed by their values of conserved KdV charges. Our work solidifies evidence for the KdV-generalized ETH in 2d CFTs and emphasizes Renyi entropy as a sensitive probe of the reduced-density matrix.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics without Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our fundamental theories, i.e., the quantum theory and general relativity, are invariant under time reversal. Only when we treat system from the point of view of thermodynamics, i.e., averaging between many subsystem components, an arrow of time emerges. The relation between thermodynamic and the quantum theory has been fertile, deeply explored and still a source of new investigations. The relation between the quantum theory and gravity, while it has not yet brought an established theory of quantum gravity, has certainly sparkled in depth analysis and tentative new theories. On the other hand, the connection between gravity and thermodynamics is less investigated and more puzzling. I review a selection of results in covariant thermodynamics, such as the construction of a covariant notion of thermal equilibrium by considering tripartite systems. I discuss how such construction requires a relational take on thermodynamics, similarly of what happens in the quantum theory and in gravity</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of &lt;1% at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. To achieve both spin channels in $\pi$-diradicals, we leverage on weaker spin-orbit couplings beyond the nearest-neighbour approximation, made possible by careful control of orbital nodal structures and group-theoretical considerations. These analyses are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around 30% under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings during electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Riemannian metric: a new perspective on the quantum realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics, quantum geometry within the Riemannian metric elucidates various exotic phenomena, including the Hall effects driven by Berry curvature and quantum metric. In this work, we propose novel quantum geometries within a pseudo-Riemannian framework to explore unique characteristic of quantum matter. By defining distinct distances on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and incorporating spin degree of freedom, we introduce the Pauli quantum geometric tensor. The imaginary part of this tensor corresponds to the Pauli Berry curvature, leading to the discovery a novel quantum phase: Pauli semimetal in PT-symmetric systems. This phase, characterized by the topological Pauli Chern number, manifests as a two-dimensional Pauli Chern insulator with helical edge states. These topological phases, uniquely revealed by the Pauli-Riemannian metric, go beyond the familiar Riemannian metric, where Berry curvature vanishes due to PT-symmetry. Pauli Chern number can classify helical topological insulator with or without time reversal symmetry. Pseudo-Riemannian metrics offer new insights into quantum materials and extend the scope of quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>True decoherence-free-subspace derived from a semiconductor double quantum dot Heisenberg spin-trimer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins in solid systems can inherently serve as qubits for quantum simulation or quantum information processing. Spin qubits are usually prone to environmental magnetic field fluctuations; however, a spin qubit encoded in a decoherence-free-subspace (DFS) can be protected from certain degrees of environmental noise depending on the specific structure of the DFS. Here, we derive the "true" DFS from an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 trimer, which protects the qubit states against both short- and long-wavelength magnetic field fluctuations. We define the spin trimer with three electrons confined in a gate-defined GaAs double quantum dot (DQD) where we exploit Wigner-molecularization in one of the quantum dots. We first utilize the trimer for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which generates a sizable magnetic field difference, $\Delta B_\mathrm{z}$, within the DQD. We show that large $\Delta B_\mathrm{z}$ significantly alters the eigenspectrum of the trimer and results in the "true" DFS in the DQD. Real-time Bayesian estimation of the DFS energy gap explicitly demonstrates protection of the DFS against short-wavelength magnetic field fluctuations in addition to long-wavelength ones. Our findings pave the way toward compact DFS structures for exchange-coupled quantum dot spin chains, the internal structure of which can be coherently controlled completely decoupled from environmental magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). To tackle the problem cumbersome existent methods of eantanglement entropy calculation, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. Taking a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and show the high computation precision. In this simulation, the calculated scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy elucidates the different phases of the Fermi surface and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Bug-locating Method based on Statistical Testing for Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a bug is detected by testing a quantum program on a quantum computer, we want to determine its location to fix it. To locate the bug, the quantum program is divided into several segments, and each segment is tested. However, to prepare a quantum state that is input to a segment, it is necessary to execute all the segments ahead of that segment in a quantum computer. This means that the cost of testing each segment depends on its location. We can also locate a buggy segment only if it is confirmed that there are no bugs in all segments ahead of that buggy segment. Since a quantum program is tested statistically on the basis of measurement results, there is a tradeoff between testing accuracy and cost. These characteristics are unique to quantum programs and complicate locating bugs. We propose an efficient bug-locating method consisting of four approaches, cost-based binary search, early determination, finalization, and looking back, which take these characteristics into account. We present experimental results that indicate that the proposed method can reduce the bug-locating cost, represented as the number of executed quantum gates, compared to naive methods that do not use the four approaches. The limitation and usefulness of the proposed method are also discussed from the experimental results.</description>

Abstract: The ability to manipulate the spatial structure of light is fundamental for a range of applications, from classical communication to quantum information processing. Multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) addresses the limitations of single-plane modulation by enabling full control over multiple spatial modes of light through a series of phase masks separated by free-space propagation. In this tutorial, we present a step-by-step guide for building and aligning a 10-plane programmable light converter using a single spatial light modulator (SLM) and standard optical components. Our method allows precise alignment, achieving single-pixel accuracy with a relatively simple setup. We hope that this guide will help other researchers to quickly adopt and adapt MPLC technology for their own experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian Thouless pumping intertwines adiabatic quantum control and topological quantum transport and it holds potential for quantum metrology and computing. In this work, we introduce a ladder model featuring two doubly-degenerate bands and we show that adiabatic manipulation of the lattice parameters results in non-Abelian Thouless pumping, inducing both the displacement of an initially localized state and a geometric unitary transformation within the degenerate subspace. Additionally, we show that the structure and symmetry of the ladder model can be understood through its connection to a Yang monopole model. The proposed Hamiltonian can be realized using cold atoms in optical lattices, enabling the experimental demonstration of non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a genuinely quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Assessing small accelerations using a bosonic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Josephson junctions provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum tunneling and coherence phenomena in ultracold atomic systems. While extensive research has examined the Josephson-junction dynamics in various double-well configurations, most studies have been limited to inertial reference frames. In the present work, we posed the question how placing a Josephson junction in a non-inertial reference frame would impact the quantum tunnelling. Our findings demonstrate that accelerating a Josephson junction alters the tunneling dynamics. Conversely, tunneling behavior can be used to assess the acceleration of the system. By analyzing the changes in physical properties, we can assess the acceleration of the double-well. We begin with the most simple non-inertial frame: moving with constant acceleration. The tunneling time decreases exponentially as acceleration increases, making it effective for measuring larger accelerations. However, for smaller accelerations, accurate assessment requires accounting for many-body depletion, which decreases linearly as acceleration rises. Next, we explore a more complex scenario where the acceleration is time dependent. In this case, the acceleration is mapped onto the tunneling time period and depletion, which again serve as predictors of acceleration. We go further by conducting a detailed analysis of the change in tunnelling dynamics when the system deviates from constant or zero acceleration. The quantitative analysis show that the depletion changes exponentially near constant acceleration, while around zero acceleration, the change follows a polynomial pattern. All in all, we quantify how the tunneling process, as well as the mean-field and many-body properties, evolve in a non-inertial system of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

To this end, we derive the quantum spin representation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory, and compose a quantum circuit carefully tailored to hard wares, reducing the use of CZ gates. Since it is still challenging to simulate Hamiltonian evolution in present noisy quantum processors, we make the step size in the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition very large, and simulate thermalization dynamics in Floquet circuit composed of the Suzuki-Trotter evolution. We demonstrate that IBM's Heron quantum processor can simulate, by error mitigation, Floqeut thermalization dynamics in a large system consisting of $62$ qubits. Our work would be a benchmark for further quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using real devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Online Quantum Dots Charge Autotuning Using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-based semiconductor qubits hold promise for scalable quantum computing, yet they require reliable autonomous calibration procedures. This study presents an experimental demonstration of online single-dot charge autotuning using a convolutional neural network integrated into a closed-loop calibration system. The autotuning algorithm explores the gates' voltage space to localize charge transition lines, thereby isolating the one-electron regime without human intervention. In 20 experimental runs on a device cooled to 25mK, the method achieved a success rate of 95% in locating the target electron regime, highlighting the robustness of this method against noise and distribution shifts from the offline training set. Each tuning run lasted an average of 2 hours and 9 minutes, primarily due to the limited speed of the current measurement. This work validates the feasibility of machine learning-driven real-time charge autotuning for quantum dot devices, advancing the development toward the control of large qubit arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the microscopic formulation of Landauer's principle, when information is deleted the Von Neumann entropy of the system gets reduced with a corresponding energy cost. Although within the same perspective the growth of the entropy should remain unconstrained we show that during quantum amplification the heat flow does restrict the increase of the Von Neumann entropy. When applied to the case of relic gravitons (with frequencies between the aHz region and the THz domain) the bounds obtained here set a limit on initial thermal gravitons and on the total duration of inflation.</description>

Abstract: The rates of production of radio/microwave N-identical photons states |N&gt; from stimulated emission in the solar atmosphere are estimated. Effects of various decohering factors are shown to be small. Ground based measurements of these quantum states via the inverse HOM effect are proposed.

      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also recall that non-involutive solutions of the braid equation are obtained from shelf and rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all involutive set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the flip map via a parametric twist. The notion of braces is also presented as the suitable algebraic structure associated to involutive set-theoretic solutions. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability of Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is also discussed. The explicit form of the Drinfel'd twist is presented allowing the derivation of general set-theoretic solutions.</description>

      <title>Repeated measurements on non-replicable systems and their consequences for Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Born rule describes the probability of obtaining an outcome when measuring an observable of a quantum system. As it can only be tested by measuring many copies of the system under consideration, it does not hold for non-replicable systems. For these systems, we give a procedure to predict the future statistics of measurement outcomes through Repeated Measurements (RM). This is done by extending the validity of quantum mechanics to those systems admitting no replicas; we prove that if the statistics of the results acquired by performing RM on such systems is sufficiently similar to that obtained by the Born rule, the latter can be used effectively. We apply our framework to a repeatedly measured Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar quantum field, which is an example of a system (detector) interacting with an uncontrollable environment (field) for which using RM is necessary. Analysing what an observer learns from the RM outcomes, we find a regime where history-dependent RM probabilities are close to the Born ones. Consequently, the latter can be used for all practical purposes. Finally, we numerically study inertial and accelerated detectors, showing that an observer can see the Unruh effect via RM.</description>

      <title>Randomness: what is it and why does it matter?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomness is a crucial resource for a broad range of important applications, such as Monte Carlo simulation and computation, generative artificial intelligence and cryptography. But what is randomness? A widely accepted definition has eluded researchers thus far, yet without one any work that relies on notion of randomness lacks scientific rigor and its results are questionable. Here, I propose an information-theory-based definition of randomness which, unlike previous attempts, does not list desired properties of the generated number sequence, but rather focuses on the physical process of random number generation itself. This approach results in a definition which complies with our intuitive perception of randomness. It is demonstrated to be non-empty and verifiable. Moreover, a new quantity named "randomness deviation" allows for a practical measure of quality of a random number generating process or a device. An expression for it is derived for a Markovian process, which is frequently encountered in practice. Finally, a process-oriented definition of a random number sequence completes the toolbox needed for understanding, proving, and practical use of randomness.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. Our recent work [arXiv:2108.13401] proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.</description>

      <title>Decoupling by local random unitaries without simultaneous smoothing, and applications to multi-user quantum information tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a simple telescoping sum trick, together with the triangle inequality and a tensorisation property of expected-contractive coefficients of random channels, allow us to achieve general simultaneous decoupling for multiple users via local actions. Employing both old [Dupuis et al. Commun. Math. Phys. 328:251-284 (2014)] and new methods [Dupuis, arXiv:2105.05342], we obtain bounds on the expected deviation from ideal decoupling either in the one-shot setting in terms of smooth min-entropies, or the finite block length setting in terms of R\'enyi entropies. These bounds are essentially optimal without the need to address the simultaneous smoothing conjecture, which remains unresolved.
  This leads to one-shot, finite block length, and asymptotic achievability results for several tasks in quantum Shannon theory, including local randomness extraction of multiple parties, multi-party assisted entanglement concentration, multi-party quantum state merging, and quantum coding for the quantum multiple access channel. Because of the one-shot nature of our protocols, we obtain achievability results without the need for time-sharing, which at the same time leads to easy proofs of the asymptotic coding theorems. We show that our one-shot decoupling bounds furthermore yield achievable rates (so far only conjectured) for all four tasks in compound settings, that is for only partially known i.i.d. source or channel, which are furthermore optimal for entanglement of assistance and state merging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first online quantum algorithm for solving zero-sum games with $\widetilde O(1)$ regret under the game setting. Moreover, our quantum algorithm computes an $\varepsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium of an $m \times n$ matrix zero-sum game in quantum time $\widetilde O(\sqrt{m+n}/\varepsilon^{2.5})$. Our algorithm uses standard quantum inputs and generates classical outputs with succinct descriptions, facilitating end-to-end applications. Technically, our online quantum algorithm "quantizes" classical algorithms based on the optimistic multiplicative weight update method. At the heart of our algorithm is a fast quantum multi-sampling procedure for the Gibbs sampling problem, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian transport distinguishes three usually equivalent notions of entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend entropy production to a deeply quantum regime involving noncommuting conserved quantities. Consider a unitary transporting conserved quantities ("charges") between two systems initialized in thermal states. Three common formulae model the entropy produced. They respectively cast entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable, as an information-theoretic uncertainty measure, and as a quantifier of irreversibility. Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulae. Charges' noncommutation, we find, breaks the formulae's equivalence. Furthermore, different formulae quantify different physical effects of charges' noncommutation on entropy production. For instance, entropy production can signal contextuality - true nonclassicality - by becoming nonreal. This work opens up stochastic thermodynamics to noncommuting - and so particularly quantum - charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its advent in 2011, boson sampling has been a preferred candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage because of its simplicity and near-term requirements compared to other quantum algorithms. We propose to use a variant, called coarse-grained boson-sampling (CGBS), as a quantum Proof-of-Work (PoW) scheme for blockchain consensus. The users perform boson sampling using input states that depend on the current block information and commit their samples to the network. Afterwards, CGBS strategies are determined which can be used to both validate samples and reward successful miners. By combining rewards for miners committing honest samples together with penalties for miners committing dishonest samples, a Nash equilibrium is found that incentivizes honest nodes. We provide numerical evidence that these validation tests are hard to spoof classically without knowing the binning scheme ahead of time and show the robustness of our protocol to small partial distinguishability of photons. The scheme works for both Fock state boson sampling and Gaussian boson sampling and provides dramatic speedup and energy savings relative to computation by classical hardware.</description>

Abstract: Measurements with randomly chosen settings determine many important properties of quantum states without the need for a shared reference frame or calibration. They naturally emerge in the context of quantum communication and quantum computing when dealing with noisy environments, and allow the estimation of properties of complex quantum systems in an easy and efficient manner. In this review, we present the advancements made in utilising randomised measurements in various scenarios of quantum information science. We describe how to detect and characterise different forms of entanglement, including genuine multipartite entanglement and bound entanglement. Bell inequalities are discussed to be typically violated even with randomised measurements, especially for a growing number of particles and settings. Furthermore, we also present an overview on the estimation of non-linear functions of quantum states and shadow tomography from randomised measurements. Throughout the review, we complement the description of theoretical ideas by explaining key experiments.</description>

      <title>Optical payload design for downlink quantum key distribution and keyless communication using CubeSats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution is costly and, at the moment, offers low performance in space applications. Other more recent protocols could offer a potential practical solution to this problem. In this work, a preliminary optical payload design using commercial off-the-shelf elements for a quantum communication downlink in a 3U CubeSat is proposed. It is shown that this quantum state emitter allows the establishment of two types of quantum communication between the satellite and the ground station: quantum key distribution and quantum keyless private communication. Numerical simulations are provided that show the feasibility of the scheme for both protocols as well as their performance. For the simplified BB84, a maximum secret key rate of about 80 kHz and minimum QBER of slightly more than $0.07\ \%$ is found, at the zenith, while for quantum private keyless communication, a 700 MHz private rate is achieved. This design serves as a platform for the implementation of novel quantum communication protocols that can improve the performance of quantum communications in space.</description>

      <title>A Meta Logarithmic-Sobolev Inequality for Phase-Covariant Gaussian Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a meta logarithmic-Sobolev (log-Sobolev) inequality for the Lindbladian of all single-mode phase-covariant Gaussian channels of bosonic quantum systems, and prove that this inequality is saturated by thermal states. We show that our inequality provides a general framework to derive information theoretic results regarding phase-covariant Gaussian channels. Specifically, by using the optimality of thermal states, we explicitly compute the optimal constant $\alpha_p$, for $1\leq p\leq 2$, of the $p$-log-Sobolev inequality associated to the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. Prior to our work, the optimal constant was only determined for $p=1$. Our meta log-Sobolev inequality also enables us to provide an alternative proof for the constrained minimum output entropy conjecture in the single-mode case. Specifically, we show that for any single-mode phase-covariant Gaussian channel $\Phi$, the minimum of the von Neumann entropy $S\big(\Phi(\rho)\big)$ over all single-mode states $\rho$ with a given lower bound on $S(\rho)$, is achieved at a thermal state.</description>

Abstract: Attosecond observations of coherent electron dynamics in molecules and nanostructures can be achieved by combining conventional scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses. While experimental studies in the sub-cycle regime are underway, a robust strong-field theory description has remained elusive. Here we devise a model based on the strong-field approximation. Valid in all regimes, it provides a surprising analogy to the standard model of STM. We also show that the intuitive three-step model of attosecond science directly emerges from our model and describe the optimal conditions for attosecond STM experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ZX-Diagrams with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ZX-diagrams are a powerful graphical language for the description of quantum processes with applications in fundamental quantum mechanics, quantum circuit optimization, tensor network simulation, and many more. The utility of ZX-diagrams relies on a set of local transformation rules that can be applied to them without changing the underlying quantum process they describe. These rules can be exploited to optimize the structure of ZX-diagrams for a range of applications. However, finding an optimal sequence of transformation rules is generally an open problem. In this work, we bring together ZX-diagrams with reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique designed to discover an optimal sequence of actions in a decision-making problem and show that a trained reinforcement learning agent can significantly outperform other optimization techniques like a greedy strategy, simulated annealing, and state-of-the-art hand-crafted algorithms. The use of graph neural networks to encode the policy of the agent enables generalization to diagrams much bigger than seen during the training phase.</description>

      <title>Simulating 2D topological quantum phase transitions on a digital quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient preparation of many-body ground states is key to harnessing the power of quantum computers in studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose a simple method to design exact linear-depth parameterized quantum circuits which prepare a family of ground states across topological quantum phase transitions in 2D. We achieve this by constructing ground states represented by isometric tensor networks (isoTNS), which form a subclass of tensor network states that are efficiently preparable. By continuously tuning a parameter in the wavefunction, the many-body ground state undergoes quantum phase transitions, exhibiting distinct 2D quantum phases. We illustrate this by constructing an isoTNS path with bond dimension $D = 2$ interpolating between distinct symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases. At the transition point, the wavefunction is related to a gapless point in the classical six-vertex model. Furthermore, the critical wavefunction supports a power-law correlation along one spatial direction while remaining long-range ordered in the other spatial direction. We provide an explicit parametrized local quantum circuit for the path and show that the 2D isoTNS can also be efficiently simulated by a holographic quantum algorithm requiring only an 1D array of qubits.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Interior-Point Methods for Quantum Relative Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) programming is a recently popular and challenging class of convex optimization problems with significant applications in quantum computing and quantum information theory. We are interested in modern interior point (IP) methods based on optimal self-concordant barriers for the QRE cone. A range of theoretical and numerical challenges associated with such barrier functions and the QRE cones have hindered the scalability of IP methods. To address these challenges, we propose a series of numerical and linear algebraic techniques and heuristics aimed at enhancing the efficiency of gradient and Hessian computations for the self-concordant barrier function, solving linear systems, and performing matrix-vector products. We also introduce and deliberate about some interesting concepts related to QRE such as symmetric quantum relative entropy (SQRE). We also introduce a two-phase method for performing facial reduction that can significantly improve the performance of QRE programming. Our new techniques have been implemented in the latest version (DDS 2.2) of the software package DDS. In addition to handling QRE constraints, DDS accepts any combination of several other conic and non-conic convex constraints. Our comprehensive numerical experiments encompass several parts including 1) a comparison of DDS 2.2 with Hypatia for the nearest correlation matrix problem, 2) using DDS for combining QRE constraints with various other constraint types, and 3) calculating the key rate for quantum key distribution (QKD) channels and presenting results for several QKD protocols.</description>

      <title>A Note on Output Length of One-Way State Generators and EFIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the output length of one-way state generators (OWSGs), their weaker variants, and EFIs.
  - Standard OWSGs. Recently, Cavalar et al. (arXiv:2312.08363) give OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(\log \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, and conjecture that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. We prove their conjecture in a stronger manner by showing that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. This means that their construction is optimal in terms of output length.
  - Inverse-polynomial-advantage OWSGs. Let $\epsilon$-OWSGs be a parameterized variant of OWSGs where a quantum polynomial-time adversary's advantage is at most $\epsilon$. For any constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$, we construct $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with $((c+1)\log \lambda+O(1))$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with at most $(c\log \lambda-2)$-qubit outputs.
  - Constant-advantage OWSGs. For any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct $\epsilon$-OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of subexponentially secure OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $O(1)$-OWSGs with $((\log \log \lambda)/2+O(1))$-qubit outputs.
  - Weak OWSGs. We refer to $(1-1/\mathsf{poly}(\lambda))$-OWSGs as weak OWSGs. We construct weak OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(1)$ assuming the existence of exponentially secure OWFs with linear expansion. We show that this is tight by proving that there do not exist weak OWSGs with $O(1)$-qubit outputs.
  - EFIs. We show that there do not exist $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs. We show that this is tight by proving that there exist $\omega(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs assuming the existence of exponentially secure PRGs.</description>

Abstract: Noncommutative constraint satisfaction problems (NC-CSPs) are higher-dimensional operator extensions of classical CSPs. Despite their significance in quantum information, their approximability remains largely unexplored. A notable example of a noncommutative CSP that is not solvable in polynomial time is NC-Max-$3$-Cut. We present a $0.864$-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our approach extends to a broader class of both classical and noncommutative CSPs. We introduce three key concepts: approximate isometry, relative distribution, and $\ast$-anticommutation, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Zero-entropy encoders and simultaneous decoders in identification via quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by deterministic identification via classical channels, where the encoder is not allowed to use randomization, we revisit the problem of identification via quantum channels but now with the additional restriction that the message encoding must use pure quantum states, rather than general mixed states. Together with the previously considered distinction between simultaneous and general decoders, this suggests a two-dimensional spectrum of different identification capacities, whose behaviour could a priori be very different.
  We demonstrate two new results as our main findings: first, we show that all four combinations (pure/mixed encoder, simultaneous/general decoder) have a double-exponentially growing code size, and that indeed the corresponding identification capacities are lower bounded by the classical transmission capacity for a general quantum channel, which is given by the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem. Secondly, we show that the simultaneous identification capacity of a quantum channel equals the simultaneous identification capacity with pure state encodings, thus leaving three linearly ordered identification capacities. By considering some simple examples, we finally show that these three are all different: general identification capacity can be larger than pure-state-encoded identification capacity, which in turn can be larger than pure-state-encoded simultaneous identification capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper, we propose a new quantum effect that naturally emerges from describing the quantum particle as a classical fluid. Following the hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics for a particle in a finite convex region, we show how the maximum values of the wavefunction's amplitude lie along the boundaries of the region when imposing a vanished quantum potential, implying\ a classical flow velocity of the particle. The effect is obtained for the case of particles in curved space, described by Riemannian structures. We further show that such an effect\ cannot be achieved in the relativistic regime when dealing with quantum particles in flat or curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Characterization of non-Markovianity with maximal extractable qubit-reservoir entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical behavior of a qubit in a reservoir is critical to applications in quantum technological protocols, ranging from quantum computation to quantum metrology. The effect of the reservoir depends on reservoir's spectral structure, as well as on the qubit-reservoir coupling strength. We here propose a measure for quantifying the non-Markovian effect of a reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum, based on the maximum qubit-reservoir quantum entanglement that can be extracted. Numerical simulation shows this entanglement exhibits a monotonous behavior in response to the variation of the coupling strength. We confirm the validity of this measure with an experiment, where a superconducting qubit is controllably coupled to a lossy resonator, which acts as a reservoir for the qubit. The experimental results illustrate the maximal extractable entanglement is progressively increased with the strengthening of the non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Designing high-fidelity two-qubit gates between fluxonium qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a bottom-up, first-principles approach to design a two-qubit gate between fluxonium qubits for minimal error, speed, and control simplicity. Our proposed architecture consists of two fluxoniums coupled via a linear resonator. Using a linear coupler introduces the possibility of material optimization for suppressing its loss, enables efficient driving of state-selective transitions through its large charge zero point fluctuation, reduces sensitivity to junction aging, and partially mitigates coherent coupling to two-level systems. Crucially, a resonator-as-coupler approach also suggests a clear path to increased connectivity between fluxonium qubits, by reducing capacitive loading when the coupler has a high impedance. After performing analytic and numeric analyses of the circuit Hamiltonian and gate dynamics, we tune circuit parameters to destructively interfere sources of coherent error, revealing an efficient, fourth-order scaling of coherent error with gate duration. For component properties from the literature, we predict an open-system average CZ gate infidelity of $1.86 \times 10^{-4}$ in 70ns.</description>

      <title>51% Attack via Difficulty Increase with a Small Quantum Miner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a strategy for a single quantum miner with relatively low hashing power, with the same ramifications as a 51% attack. Bitcoin nodes consider the chain with the highest cumulative proof-of-work to be the valid chain. A quantum miner can manipulate the block timestamps to multiply the difficulty by $c$. The fork-choice rule counts every block with increased difficulty with weight $c$. By using Grover's algorithm, it is only $O(\sqrt c)$ harder for the quantum miner to mine such blocks. By picking a high enough $c$, the single quantum miner can create a competing chain with fewer blocks, but more cumulative proof-of-work. The time required is $O(\frac{1}{r^2})$ epochs, where $r$ is the fraction of the block rewards that the quantum miner would have received if they mined honestly.
  Most proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are vulnerable to our attack. However, it will likely be impossible to execute in forthcoming years, as it requires an extremely fast and fault-tolerant quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer states, which are also known as the Clifford states, have been commonly utilized in quantum information, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit simulation due to their simple mathematical structure. In this work, we apply stabilizer states to tackle quantum many-body ground state problems and introduce the concept of stabilizer ground states. We establish an equivalence formalism for identifying stabilizer ground states of general Pauli Hamiltonians. Moreover, we develop an exact and linear-scaled algorithm to obtain stabilizer ground states of 1D local Hamiltonians and thus free from discrete optimization. This proposed equivalence formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on different Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate that stabilizer ground states are promising tools for not only qualitative understanding of quantum systems, but also cornerstones of more advanced classical or quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complete quantum control of a stationary quantum bit embedded in a quantum emitter is crucial for photonic quantum information technologies. Recently, the orbital degree of freedom in optically active quantum dots has emerged as a promising candidate. However, the essential ability to perform arbitrary rotations on orbital qubits remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary rotation of a hole orbital qubit with direct phase control using picosecond optical pulses. This is achieved by successfully inducing stimulated Raman transitions within $\Lambda$ systems coupled via radiative Auger processes. The new capability enables direct control of polar and azimuth angles of the Bloch vector without requiring timed precession. Our results establish orbital states in solid-state quantum emitters as a viable resource for applications in high-speed quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$ where $\alpha,z&gt;0$ ($\alpha\ne1$) for normal positive functionals $\psi,\varphi$ on general von Neumann algebras, introduced in [S.~Kato and Y.~Ueda, arXiv:2307.01790] and [S.~Kato, arXiv:2311.01748]. We prove the variational expressions and the data processing inequality (DPI) for the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences. We establish the sufficiency theorem for $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$, saying that for $(\alpha,z)$ inside the DPI bounds, the equality $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\circ\gamma\|\varphi\circ\gamma)=D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)&lt;\infty$ in the DPI under a quantum channel (or a normal $2$-positive unital map) $\gamma$ implies the reversibility of $\gamma$ with respect to $\psi,\varphi$. Moreover, we show the monotonicity properties of $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$ in the parameters $\alpha,z$ and their limits to the normalized relative entropy as $\alpha\nearrow1$ and $\alpha\searrow1$.</description>

Abstract: Shallow quantum circuits feature not only computational advantages over their classical counterparts but also cutting-edge applications. Storing quantum information generated by shallow circuits is a fundamental question of both theoretical and practical importance that remained largely unexplored. In this work, we show that $N$ copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state generated by a fixed-depth circuit can be compressed into a hybrid memory of $O(n\log_2 N)$ (qu)bits, which achieves the optimal scaling of memory cost. Our work shows that the computational complexity of resources can significantly impact the rate of quantum information processing, offering a unique and unified view of quantum Shannon theory and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimal performance of a three stroke heat engine in the microscopic regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a three-stroke engine in the microscopic regime, where the working body of the engine is composed of a two-level system. The working body of the engine aims to withdraw heat from the hot heat bath, generate work, and discharge the surplus heat into the cold heat bath through the successive execution of three strokes. In this process, the interaction of the working body with the heat baths is assumed to be energy-conserving and thus can be described by thermal operations. While earlier studies analyzed the optimal performance of this engine when the working body could be transformed by any arbitrary thermal operation, we present closed expressions for the maximum work produced by the engine and the maximum efficiency of the engine when only a restricted class of thermal operations can be implemented on the working body. Furthermore, we explore the engine's optimal performance under two well-studied classes of restrictions: thermal operations realized via Jaynes-Cummings interaction and thermal operations realizable with finite-sized heat baths. Therefore, on one hand, our results are general, as they reproduce the optimal performance achieved when any arbitrary thermal operation can be implemented on the working body once the restriction is relaxed. On the other hand, our results allow us to determine the engine's maximum work production and efficiency in a more realistic scenario, where only a restricted class of thermal operations are possible, thereby bringing our findings closer to experimental feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to tackle large-scale problems in scientific computation, including high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDE). Therefore, understanding the capability of quantum circuits through the lens of approximation theory is essential for evaluating the complexity needed for these circuits to solve such problems. In this paper, we explicitly construct quantum circuits that can approximate $d$-dimensional functions in the Korobov function space. We accomplish this by utilizing the quantum signal processing algorithm and the linear combinations of unitaries technique to build quantum circuits that implement Chebyshev polynomials, which are capable of approximating functions in the Korobov function space. Our work provides quantitative approximation error bounds and estimates the complexity of implementing the proposed quantum circuits. Since the Korobov function space is a subspace of the certain Sobolev spaces which are ubiquitous in studying solutions to high-dimensional PDE, our work develops a theoretical foundation for implementing a large class of functions suitable for applications on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Complex Stochastic Optimal Control Foundation of Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15964v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers when finding optimal controls. This paper explores the application of the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. It provides an in-depth investigation of the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We obtain the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. During the development of the covariant form of the HJB equation, we demonstrate that if the temporal stochastic increments of the two processes are perfectly correlated, then the spatial stochastic increments must be perfectly anti-correlated, and vice versa. The diffusion coefficient we derive has a form that enables the linearization of the HJB equation. The method for linearizing the HJB equation, along with the subsequent derivation of the Dirac equation, was developed in our previous work [V. Yordanov, Scientific Reports 14, 6507 (2024)]. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the application of stochastic optimal control theory to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Heralded photonic graph states with inefficient quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitter-based schemes for the generation of photonic graph states offer a promising, resource efficient methodology for realizing distributed quantum computation and communication protocols on near-term hardware. We present a heralded scheme for making photonic graph states that is compatible with the typically poor photon collection from state-of-the-art coherent quantum emitters. We demonstrate that the construction time for large graph states can be polynomial in the photon collection efficiency, as compared to the exponential scaling of current emitter-based schemes, which assume deterministic photon collection. The additional overhead to achieve this advantage consists of an extra spin system plus one additional spin-spin entangling gate per photon added to the graph. While the proposed scheme enables the generation of graph states for arbitrary applications, we show how it can be further simplified for the specific task of measurement-based computation, leading to significantly higher rates and removing the need for photonic memory in certain computations. As an example use-case of our scheme, we construct a protocol for secure two-party computation that can be implemented efficiently on current hardware. Estimates of the fidelity to produce graph states used in the computation are given, based on current trapped ion experimental benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Superradiant Phase Transitions and Multicriticality in a Cavity QED System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of nonreciprocal superradiant phase transitions and novel multicriticality in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, where a two-level atom interacts with two counter-propagating modes of a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microcavity. The cavity rotates at a certain angular velocity, and is directionally squeezed by a unidirectional parametric pumping $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. The combination of cavity rotation and directional squeezing leads to nonreciprocal first- and second-order superradiant phase transitions. These transitions do not require ultrastrong atom-field couplings and can be easily controlled by the external pump field. Through a full quantum description of the system Hamiltonian, we identify two types of multicritical points in the phase diagram, both of which exhibit controllable nonreciprocity. These results open a new door for all-optical manipulation of superradiant transitions and multicritical behaviors in light-matter systems, with potential applications in engineering various integrated nonreciprocal quantum devices</description>

      <title>An operational distinction between quantum entanglement and classical non-separability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement describes superposition states in multi-dimensional systems, at least two partite, which cannot be factorized and are thus non-separable. Non-separable states exist also in classical theories involving vector spaces. In both cases, it is possible to violate a Bell-like inequality. This has led to controversial discussions, which we resolve by identifying an operational distinction between the classical and quantum cases.</description>

      <title>Analytically exact solution of the Schrodinger equation for neutral helium in the ground state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents the analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation and its corresponding wave function for the neutral helium or helium-like atoms in the ground state. The entangled state function of the electrons for S,L=0 is examined in detail. The basic idea is, though we treat the electron as a point like particle, not to understand its field as a point charge with the typical Coulomb field as in common approaches, but to solve the Schrodinger equation with an electric potential taking Heisenberg uncertainty principle into account. A method for describing a generic electron potential is derived, and the result was integrated into the Schrodinger equation. As a direct consequence the electromagnetic coupling of the electrons was investigated by introducing an effective interaction distance to describe vacuum polarization effects. The Schrodinger equation is solved using Laplace transformations. By determining the effective interaction distance iteratively, the ground state energy was calculated and compared with the literature values. It could be shown that with a given value the backward calculation of the effective interaction distance gives plausible results of the ground state energy thus providing us with a convincing method to describe the helium atom analytically. An upper limit estimation for the spatial dimension of the interaction distance for quantum-electrodynamical effects around the electron is given as well as the existence of a minimal distance of a stable bonding state between two electrons in the nucleonic field. As a result, the chemical inertness of helium regarding chemical reactions i.e., the principle of the "closed" electron shell - can be made plausible. The wave function found for the helium atom is compared with the known solutions for the hydrogen atom and Hylleraas function as well, and differences between those are worked out.</description>

      <title>Enhancing phase sensitivity in Mach-Zehnder interferometer with various detection schemes using SU(1,1) coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving interferometric phase sensitivity is crucial for high-precision measurements in rapidly developing quantum technologies. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is a versatile tool for analyzing this phenomenon. By splitting and recombining a light beam using beam splitters, MZIs allow for precise phase sensitivity analysis using tools like the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). This paper analyzes the phase sensitivity of a MZI in various scenarios using different detection schemes and input states. We compare the single- and two-parameter quantum estimation and their associated QCRB for three phase-shift situations: in both arms, only in the upper arm (asymmetric), and in both arms symmetrically. We then investigate the phase sensitivity under three detection schemes: difference intensity, single-mode intensity, and balanced homodyne. Additionally, we explore the use of Perelomov and Barut-Girardello coherent states, two types of SU(1,1) coherent states, in all scenarios. Notably, we demonstrate that under optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing entangled SU(1,1) coherent states as input states.</description>

      <title>Activation of post-quantumness in bipartite generalised EPR scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a standard bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) scenario, Alice and Bob share a system prepared in an entangled state and Alice performs local measurements. One possible generalisation of this set-up is to allow Bob to also locally process his subsystem. Then, correlations generated in such generalised EPR scenarios are examples of non-signalling bipartite resources, called assemblages, that can exhibit post-quantum behavior, i.e., cannot be generated using solely quantum systems. There exist assemblages that, despite being post-quantum resources, can only generate quantum correlations in bipartite Bell-type scenarios. Here, we present a protocol for activation of post-quantumness in bipartite generalised EPR scenarios such as the so-called Bob-with-input, measurement-device-independent, and channel EPR scenarios. By designing a protocol that involves distributing the assemblages in a larger network, we derive tailored Bell inequalities which can be violated beyond their quantum bound in this new set-up. Our results show that in all of the above generalised scenarios, the post-quantumness of the assemblages can be witnessed at the level of correlations they produce.</description>

      <title>Eluding Zeno effect via dephasing and detuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze some variants of the Zeno effect in which the frequent observation of the population of an intermediate state does not prevent the transition of the system from the initial state to a certain final state. This is achieved by considering system observation involving suitably introduced phase shifts and detunings that leads to a rather rich measurement-induced dynamics by the alteration of the interference governing quantum evolution. For initial nonclassical states this includes entanglement as a way of evolution from the initial to the final state avoiding the intermediate state. This possibility is presented in a particular physical scenario in the form of a chain of three coupled harmonic oscillators, but we readily show then that the idea can be applied to other physical systems as well, such as atomic-level dynamics. These results are significant for a better knowledge of fundamental quantum concepts as well as regarding suitable applications in the proper control of quantum dynamics, as this is a key feature of modern applications of the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Noise analysis of a quasi-phase-matched quantum frequency converter and higher-order counter-propagating SPDC</title>

Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) will be an indispensable ingredient in future quantum technologies. For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realised in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the inter-converted wavelengths. Here we comprehensively investigate the noise spectrum of a QFC device pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realised as a bulk periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal quasi-phase-matched for conversion between 637 nm and 1587 nm, which was also polished and coated to resonantly enhance the pump field by a factor of 50. While Raman scattering dominates the noise background from 1140 nm to 1330 nm, at larger energy shifts (beyond 60 THz), parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the strongest noise source. Further, the noise spectrum was contaminated by a regular succession of narrow-band peaks, which we attribute to a heretofore unidentified higher-order counter-propagating SPDC processes - with quasi-phase-matching orders up to 44 evident in our measurements. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the limiting noise sources in QFC devices that use quasi-phase-matched crystals and will prove an invaluable resource in guiding their future development.</description>

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger cat (SC) states are important in quantum optics because of their non-Gaussian properties. We propose a novel method of conditional generation of bright (multi-photon) SC states that uses degenerate parametric down-conversion and heralding measurement of the photon number in the pump mode. We show that this method, in principle, could be implemented using the modern high-\(Q\) optical microresonators.</description>

      <title>Using PT-symmetric Qubits to Break the Tradeoff Between Fidelity and the Degree of Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A noteworthy discovery is that the minimal evolution time is smaller for parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric systems compared to Hermitian setups. Moreover, there is a significant acceleration of two-qubit quantum entanglement preparation near the exceptional point (EP), or spectral coalescence, within such system. Nevertheless, an important problem often overlooked for quantum EP-based devices is their fidelity, greatly affected by the process of dissipation or post-selection, creating an inherent trade-off relation between the degree of entanglement and fidelity. Our study demonstrates that this limitation can be effectively overcome by harnessing an active $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system, which possesses balanced gain and loss, enabling maximal entanglement with rapid speed, high fidelity, and greater resilience to non-resonant errors. This new approach can efficiently prepare multi-qubit entanglement and use not only bipartite but also tripartite entanglement, as illustrative examples, even when the precise gain-loss balance is not strictly maintained. Our analytical findings are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, confirming the potential of truly $\mathcal{PT}$-devices as a powerful tool for creating and engineering diverse quantum resources for applications in quantum information technology</description>

We give quantum algorithms for computing these coefficients whenever the ratio of dimensions of the representations is polynomial and study the computational complexity of this problem. We show that there is an efficient classical algorithm for computing the Kostka numbers under this restriction and conjecture the existence of an analogous algorithm for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We argue why such classical algorithm does not straightforwardly work for the Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients and conjecture that our quantum algorithms lead to superpolynomial speedups for this problem. We support this conjecture by showing how our quantum algorithm avoids some hardness obstructions in computation of these coefficients. We give another quantum algorithm that estimates the multiplicities using induction and has a different cost-to-input dependence.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present a new exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

      <title>Topics in Non-local Games: Synchronous Algebras, Algebraic Graph Identities, and Quantum NP-hardness Reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10114v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the correspondence between synchronous games and their associated $*$-algebra. Building upon the work of (Helton et al., New York J. Math. 2017), we propose results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze (Watts, Helton and Klep, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 2023), we build computational tools that check the non-existence of perfect $C^*$ and algebraic strategies of synchronous games using Gr\"obner basis methods and semidefinite programming. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models questioned in (Helton et al., New York J. Math. 2017). We also extend the quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{3-SAT}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-Coloring}^*$ due to (Ji, arXiv 2013) by exhibiting another instance of such reduction $\texttt{3-SAT}^* \leq_p \texttt{Clique}^*$.</description>

      <title>How to integrate a miniature optical cavity in a linear ion trap: shielding dielectrics and trap symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One method of scaling up quantum systems is to adopt a modular approach. In the ion trap architecture, an efficient photonic interface between independent linear ion traps would allow for such expansion. To this end, an optical cavity with a small mode volume can be utilised to enhance the photon emission probability from the ion. Miniature fibre-based Fabry-Perot cavities have been integrated into three-dimensional Paul traps that hold a single ion, whereas an efficient interface between an optical cavity and a linear trap that can keep multiple ions has remained elusive. This presents a barrier for combining the benefits of the motional coupling in a chain of ions with optical interface between ion traps. In this paper, we show that simple electrically conductive shielding of the fibres could provide substantial advantage in mitigating the adverse effects of stray charges and motional heating by dielectrics. We also reveal that the conductive shields are not compatible with the conventional radio frequency (rf) drive in ion traps but using two rf signals with opposite phases can solve this issue. Furthermore the role played by the symmetry of the electrodes when incorporating an element that disrupts the translational symmetry of a linear trap is elucidated analytically. As a result it is realized that two-dimensional implementation of a linear ion trap such as a surface trap is inherently not suitable for integrating a shielded miniature optical cavity due to the lack of geometrical symmetry. Based on the insights obtained through the analysis, we identify essential components and a design strategy that should be incorporated in a linear ion trap for successful integration of a miniature optical cavity.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead magic state distillation with color codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, which differ in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme uses faulty T-measurement, offering resource efficiency when the target infidelity is above a certain threshold ($\sim 35p^3$ for physical error rate $p$). To achieve lower infidelities while maintaining resource efficiency, our second scheme exploits a distillation-free fault-tolerant magic state preparation protocol, achieving significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\sim 10^{-19}$ for $p = 10^{-4}$) than the first scheme. Notably, our schemes outperform the best existing magic state distillation methods for color codes by up to about two orders of magnitude in resource costs for a given achievable target infidelity.</description>

      <title>Emergent Liouvillian exceptional points from exact principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in exceptional points in open quantum systems. The natural approach in this area has been the use of Markovian master equations. While the resulting Liouvillian EPs have been seen in a variety of systems and have been associated to numerous exotic effects, it is an open question whether such degeneracies and their peculiarities can persist beyond the validity of master equations. In this work, taking the example of a dissipative double-quantum-dot system, we show that Heisenberg equations for the system exhibit the same EPs as the corresponding master equations. To highlight the importance of this finding, we prove that the paradigmatic property associated to EPs - critical damping, persists well beyond the validity of master equations. Our results demonstrate that Liouvillian EPs can arise from underlying fundamental exact principles, rather than merely as a consequence of approximations involved in deriving master equations.</description>

      <title>Spectral signatures of the Markovian to Non-Markovian transition in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach for investigating the Markovian to non-Markovian transition in quantum aggregates strongly coupled to a vibrational bath through the analysis of linear absorption spectra. Utilizing hierarchical algebraic equations in the frequency domain, we elucidate how these spectra can effectively reveal transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, driven by the complex interplay of dissipation, aggregate-bath coupling, and intra-aggregate dipole-dipole interactions. Our results demonstrate that reduced dissipation induces spectral peak splitting, signaling the emergence of bath-induced non-Markovian effects. The spectral peak splitting can also be driven by enhanced dipole-dipole interactions, although the underlying mechanism differs from that of dissipation-induced splitting. Additionally, with an increase in aggregate-bath coupling strength, initially symmetric or asymmetric peaks with varying spectral amplitudes may merge under weak dipole-dipole interactions, whereas strong dipole-dipole interactions are more likely to cause peak splitting. Moreover, we find that spectral features serve as highly sensitive indicators for distinguishing the geometric structures of aggregates, while also unveiling the critical role geometry plays in shaping non-Markovian behavior. This study not only deepens our understanding of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition but also provides a robust framework for optimizing and controlling quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Quantum Correlation on the Holonomy of Spatially-Structured Bi-Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manifestation of entanglement within geometric phase is elucidated for spatially-structured bi-photons. Entanglement parameters are shown to influence holonomy in two distinct ways: through statistical superpositions of separable states; and via quantum correlation. These are entwined within geometric phase, motivating the construction of a projective, gauge-invariant measure that allows the manifestation of quantum correlation to be pinpointed and explained. An optical circuit consisting of a pair of misoriented mode converters gives a practical demonstration. This is facilitated by a novel pump engineering method which produces photon pairs with tunable entanglement.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the set of quantum correlations in prepare-and-measure quantum chain-shaped networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchy of tests satisfied by any probability distribution $P$ that represents the quantum correlations generated in prepare-and-measure (P\&amp;M) quantum chain-shaped networks, assuming only the inner-product information of the non-orthogonal quantum states. The P\&amp;M quantum chain-shaped networks involve multiple measurement parties, each measurement party potentially having multiple sequential receivers. Specifically, we adapt the original NPA-hierarchy by incorporating a finite number of linear and positive semi-definite constraints to characterize the quantum correlations in P\&amp;M quantum chain-shaped networks. These constraints in each hierarchy are derived from sequential measurement operators and the inner-product matrix of the non-orthogonal quantum states. We apply the adapted NPA-hierarchy to tackle some quantum information tasks, including sequential quantum random access codes (QRACs) and randomness certification. First, we derive the optimal trade-off between the two sequential receivers in the $2 \to 1$ sequential QRACs. Furthermore, we have investigated semi-device-independent randomness certification in the double violation region of $2 \to 1$ sequential QRACs. Second, considering the presence of eavesdropper (Eve) in actual communication, we show how much global and local randomness can be certified using the optimal trade-off of $2 \to 1$ sequential QRACs. Additionally, we quantify the amount of local and global randomness that can be certified from the complete probabilities generated by the two sequential receivers. We conclude that utilizing the complete set of probabilities certifies more local and global randomness than relying solely on the optimal trade-off relationship.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses frequency crowding constraints in modular quantum architecture design, focusing on the SNAIL-based quantum modules. Two key objectives are explored. First, we present physics-informed design constraints by describing a physical model for realizable gates within a SNAIL module and building a fidelity model using error budgeting derived from device characteristics. Second, we tackle the allocation problem by analyzing the impact of frequency crowding on gate fidelity as the radix of the module increases. We explore whether the gate fidelity can be preserved with a discrete set of qubit frequencies while adhering to defined separation thresholds. This work offers insights into novel quantum architectures and coupled optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of unstable noise and improve overall gate performance.</description>

Abstract: Random numbers are used in a wide range of sciences. In many applications, generating unpredictable private random numbers is indispensable. Device-independent quantum random number generation is a framework that makes use of the intrinsic randomness of quantum processes to generate numbers that are fundamentally unpredictable according to our current understanding of physics. While device-independent quantum random number generation is an exceptional theoretical feat, the difficulty of controlling quantum systems makes it challenging to carry out in practice. It is therefore desirable to harness the full power of the quantum degrees of freedom (the dimension) that one can control. It is known that no more than $2 \log(d)$ bits of private device-independent randomness can be extracted from a quantum system of local dimension $d$. In this paper we demonstrate that this bound can be achieved for all dimensions $d$ by providing a family of explicit protocols. In order to obtain our result, we develop new certification techniques that can be of wider interest in device-independent applications for scenarios in which complete certification ('self-testing') is impossible or impractical.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Fluid Correspondence in Relativistic Fluids with Spin: From Madelung Form to Gravitational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum-fluid correspondence in a charged relativistic fluid with intrinsic spin. We begin by examining the nonrelativistic case, showing that the inclusion of spin introduces a quantum correction to the classical fluid energy. This correction, coupled with Maxwell's equations, naturally leads to the Schr\"odinger equation in Madelung form. Building on this foundation, we extend the formalism to a relativistic perfect fluid, identifying the system's stress-energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis reveals that the trace of the quantum correction to this tensor corresponds to the energy density of an oscillator, with its frequency determined by the vorticity of the spin motion. We then use the stress-energy-momentum tensor to establish the relationship between the Ricci scalar curvature, as dictated by the Einstein field equations, and the fluid density in a static, spherically symmetric configuration. Lastly, we generalize the Madelung transformation to compressible Navier-Stokes flows with vorticity and viscosity by developing a tailored Clebsch representation of the velocity field. This theoretical framework offers potential applications for studying fluid-like systems with internal rotational degrees of freedom, commonly encountered in astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Freedom in the many-worlds interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I analyze the possibility of free-will in the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), arguing for their compatibility. I use as a starting point Nicolas Gisin's "The Multiverse Pandemic" (preprint arXiv:2210.05377, after Gisin, N., "L'\'epid\'emie du multivers", in "Le Plus Grand des Hasards", Belin, Paris, 2010), in which he makes an interesting case that MWI is contradicted by our hard to deny free-will. The counts he raised are:
  (1) MWI is deterministic, forcing choices on us,
  (2) in MWI all our possible choices happen, and
  (3) MWI limits creativity, because everything is entangled with everything else.
  I argue that each of these features of MWI is in fact compatible with more freedom than it may seem. In particular, MWI allows compatibilist free-will, but also free-will very much like the libertarian free-will defined by Chisholm. I argue that the position that alternative choices exist as possibilities does not make sense from a physical point of view, but MWI offers a physical ground for alternatives.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect for Multipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fate of the non-Hermitian skin effect in one-dimensional systems that conserve the dipole moment and higher moments of an associated global $\text{U}(1)$ charge. Motivated by field theoretical arguments and lattice model calculations, we demonstrate that the key feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect for $m$-pole conserving systems is the generation of an $(m+1)$th multipole moment. For example, in contrast to the conventional skin effect where charges are anomalously localized at one boundary, the dipole-conserving skin effect results in charges localized at both boundaries, in a configuration that generates an extremal quadrupole moment. In addition, we explore the dynamical consequences of the $m$-pole skin effect, focusing on charge and entanglement propagation. Both numerically and analytically, we provide evidence that long-time steady-states have Fock-space localization and an area-law scaling of entanglement entropy, which serve as quantum indicators of the skin effect.</description>

      <title>Optimized Noise Suppression for Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation promises to advance a wide range of computational tasks. However, current quantum hardware suffers from noise and is too small for error correction. Thus, accurately utilizing noisy quantum computers strongly relies on noise characterization, mitigation, and suppression. Crucially, these methods must also be efficient in terms of their classical and quantum overhead. Here, we efficiently characterize and mitigate crosstalk noise, which is a severe error source in, e.g., cross-resonance based superconducting quantum processors. For crosstalk characterization, we develop a simplified measurement experiment. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of optimal experiment scheduling and solve it for common hardware architectures. After characterization, we mitigate noise in quantum circuits by a noise-aware qubit routing algorithm. Our integer programming algorithm extends previous work on optimized qubit routing by swap insertion. We incorporate the measured crosstalk errors in addition to other, more easily accessible noise data in the objective function. Furthermore, we strengthen the underlying integer linear model by proving a convex hull result about an associated class of polytopes, which has applications beyond this work. We evaluate the proposed method by characterizing crosstalk noise for two chips with up to 127 qubits and leverage the resulting data to improve the approximation ratio of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm by up to 10 % compared to other established noise-aware routing methods. Our work clearly demonstrates the gains of including noise data when mapping abstract quantum circuits to hardware native ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present three measures of the dynamical coherence of channels, which are the generalization of several previous results. The measures are based on the generalized distance function between channels, which for example could be the divergence or a trace-distance. Free operations are considered to be detection-incoherent, creation-incoherent, and detection-creation incoherent. Free superchannels can be expressed using free pre- and post-processing channels. The new measures are monotone under free superchannels and convex.</description>

      <title>Isospin precession in non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of pseudoclassical isospin is illustrated by the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect proposed by Wu and Yang in 1975. The spatial motion is free however the isospin precesses when the enclosed magnetic flux and the incoming particle's isosopin are not parallel. The non-Abelian phase factor $\mathfrak{F}$ of Wu and Yang acts on the isospin as an S-matrix. The scattering becomes side-independent when the enclosed flux is quantized, ${\Phi}_N=N\Phi_0$ with $N$ an integer. The gauge group $SU(2)$ is an internal symmetry and generates conserved charges only when the flux is quantized, which then splits into two series: for $N=2k$ $SU(2)$ acts trivially but for $N=1+2k$ the implementation is twisted. The orbital and the internal angular momenta are separately conserved. The double rotational symmetry is broken to $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ when $N$ odd. For unquantized flux there are no internal symmetries, the charge is not conserved and protons can be turned into neutrons.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for Anderson localization on high-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has become an essential technology in the realm of secure communication, with applications ranging from secure data transmission to quantum networks. This paper presents a simple, compact, and cost-effective setup for undergraduate tutorial demonstrations of QKD. It relies on using weak coherent pulses, which can be readily produced using an attenuated laser. The system employs the simplified three-state BB84 protocol in free space, the states are encoded using linear polarization. Polarization encoding can be done passively or actively, depending on the budget available. Time multiplexing is implemented at the receiver to reduce the number of required detectors. Only two detectors are used to implement measurements on two bases, with a total of four outcomes. The result demonstrates the practicality of the system for free-space quantum communication, and its compact and portable nature makes it particularly suitable for pedagogical demonstrations. This work paves the way for engaging undergraduate students in the field of quantum communication through hands-on laboratory projects.</description>

      <title>Fate of the Mollow triplet in strongly-coupled atomic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of quantum two-level emitters have emerged as an interesting platform displaying prominent collective effects that can be harnessed for applications. Here we study such arrays under strong coherent driving, realizing an open quantum many-body problem in a strongly non-linear regime. For this we introduce a novel approach to this problem in terms of a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT), paving the way for further studies. We show that the spectrum of scattered light, characterized by the famous Mollow triplet for a single atom, develops a characteristic lineshape with flat sidebands determined by dipolar interactions and relevant for experiments. Remarkably, this is to some extent independent of the specific geometry, but is sensitive to the ordered arrangement of the atoms. This lineshape therefore characterizes atomic arrays and distinguishes them from disordered ensembles and non-interacting emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, has been widely used in high-energy physics, demonstrating remarkable results in various applications. Furthermore, the extension of machine learning to quantum computers has given rise to the emerging field of quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Complete Graph Neural Network (QCGNN), which is a variational quantum algorithm based model designed for learning on complete graphs. QCGNN with deep parametrized operators offers a polynomial speedup over its classical and quantum counterparts, leveraging the property of quantum parallelism. We investigate the application of QCGNN with the challenging task of jet discrimination, where the jets are represented as complete graphs. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis with classical models to establish a performance benchmark.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the sparse SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a system of $N$ Majorana fermions with random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$ (characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as $1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But for $p&lt;p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation infidelity as a loss function.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. This is for the first time, we see that in the same setup and using quantum point contacts, the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear response being achieved.</description>

      <title>Phase-induced vortex pinning in rotating supersolid dipolar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the pinning of vortices for a stationary rotating dipolar supersolid along the low-density paths between droplets as a function of the rotation frequency. We restrict ourselves to the stationary configurations of vortices with the same symmetry as that of the array of droplets. In particular, such an analysis clearly reveals that vortices are not only pinned at local density minima, but instead their coordinates are smooth functions of the rotation frequency. Our approach to explaining such a behavior exploits the fact that the wave function of each rotating droplet acquires a linear phase on the coordinates. Hence, the relative phases between the nearest neighboring droplets allow us to predict the position of the vortices in the intermediate low-density region. Here, we show that for a droplet distribution forming a triangular lattice, the phases of three neighboring droplets are needed for the correct description of the vortex location. In particular, for our confined system, we demonstrate that the estimate accurately reproduces the extended Gross-Pitaevskii results in the spatial regions where the neighboring droplets are well-defined.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we develop a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase-shift profiles of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. The sample axial positions are resolved with micrometer resolution, and their spectroscopy are extracted from complex-valued images recorded at various probe frequencies. The phase-angle readout is not only robust against transition saturation, but also insensitive to atom-number and optical-pumping-induced interaction-strength fluctuations. Benefiting from such features, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot resolution to the transition frequency of a $^{87}$Rb D2 line, with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate single-shot 3D field sensing by measuring local light shifts to the atomic array with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement for open systems by non-hermitian linear response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lower bound of estimated precision for a coherent parameter unitarily encoded in closed systems has been obtained, and such a lower bound is inversely proportional to the fluctuation of the encoding operator. In this paper, we first derive some general results regarding the lower bound of estimated precision for a dissipative parameter, which is non-unitarily encoded in open systems, by combining the law of error propagation and the non-hermitian linear response theory. This lower bound is related to the correlation of the encoding dissipative operator and the evolution time. We next demonstrate the utility of our general results by considering three different kinds of non-unitary encoding processes, including particle loss, relaxation, and dephasing. We finally compare the lower bound with the quantum Fisher information obtained by tomography and find they are consistent in the regime where the non-hermitian linear response applies. This lower bound can guide us to find the optimal initial states and detecting operators to significantly simplify the measurement process.</description>

      <title>Density effects on the interferometry of Efimov states by modulating magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical association of Efimov trimers in thermal gases by means of modulated magnetic fields has proven very fruitful in determining the binding energy of trimers. The latter was extracted from the number of remaining atoms, which featured oscillatory fringes stemming from the superposition of trimers with atom-dimers. Subsequent theoretical investigations utilizing the time-dependent three-body problem revealed additional association mechanisms, manifested as superpositions of the Efimov state with the trap states and the latter with atom-dimers. The three atoms were initialized in a way to emulate a thermal gas with uniform density. Here, this analysis is extended by taking into account the effects of the density profile of a semi-classical thermal gas. The supersposition of the Efimov trimer with the first atom-dimer remains the same, while the frequencies of highly oscillatory fringes shift to lower values. The latter refer to the frequencies of trimers and atom-dimers in free space since the density profile smears out the contribution of trap states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radial time-independent Schr\"odinger equation is solved for the diatomic molecules: H2, LiH, HCl, CO, VH, CrH, CuLi, TiC, NiC, and ScN using the recently developed Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis (NUFA) method. A modified Morse potential is considered and the Pekeris approximation is used to accommodate the centrifugal term. Accurate energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction solutions are obtained for vibrational ($\mathit{n}$) and rotational ($\ell$) states. For H2, LiH, HCl, and CO, excellent agreement is observed between present values and literature, provided that the Pekeris approximation remains valid. For other molecules, a collection of low and high-lying states not found in literature are reported. The NUFA method is a simple, general and accurate approach that may be applied to other interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Nanocavities for Molecular Optomechanics: their fundamental description and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vibrational Raman scattering -- a process where light exchanges energy with a molecular vibration through inelastic scattering -- is most fundamentally described in a quantum framework where both light and vibration are quantized. When the Raman scatterer is embedded inside a plasmonic nanocavity, as in some sufficiently controlled implementations of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the coupled system realizes an optomechanical cavity, where coherent and parametrically amplified light-vibration interaction becomes a resource for vibrational state engineering and nanoscale nonlinear optics. The purpose of this Perspective is to clarify the connection between the languages and parameters used in the fields of molecular cavity optomechanics (McOM) vs. its conventional, `macroscopic' counterpart, and to summarize the main results achieved so far in McOM and the most pressing experimental and theoretical challenges. We aim to make the theoretical framework of molecular cavity optomechanics practically usable for the SERS and nanoplasmonics community at large. While quality factors ($Q$'s) and mode volumes ($V$'s) essentially describe the performance of a nanocavity in enhancing light-matter interaction, we point to the light-cavity coupling efficiencies ($\eta$'s) and optomechanical cooperativities ($\mathcal{C}$'s) as the key parameters for molecular optomechanics. As an illustration of the significance of these quantities, we investigate the feasibility of observing optomechanically induced transparency with a molecular vibration -- a measurement that would allow for a direct estimate of the optomechanical cooperativity.</description>

Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>
