      <title>Rescaled Equations of Fluid Motion for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations} (RiNSE). We solve the RiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$, and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Theory of Super-Resolution Data Assimilation with Conditional Variational Autoencoders: Using Super-Resolution Operators as Background Error Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a theory of unsupervised super-resolution data assimilation (SRDA) using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). This framework employs an evidence lower bound as the objective function and encompasses the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) formalism. Similar to 3D-Var, it is essential to use a non-diagonal background error covariance matrix to assimilate distant observations. Instead of using such a non-diagonal matrix, we extend the proposed framework to employ the non-local nature of super-resolution operations. In the extended framework, super-resolution operators can serve as background error covariance matrices. Since the loss function for CVAEs is generally an evidence lower bound, SRDA can be performed using CVAEs. By incorporating the SR model into the CVAE, the encoder estimates the high-resolution (HR) analysis from the input of HR observations and low-resolution (LR) forecasts, while the decoder acts as the observation operator and reconstructs the HR observations from the estimated HR analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated through numerical experiments using an idealized barotropic ocean jet system. Compared to inference by an ensemble Kalman filter, the proposed SRDA demonstrated its ability to obtain accurate HR inferences within shorter computational times because the SRDA does not require HR numerical integration or ensemble calculations. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for the fusion of SR and DA, which will stimulate further research on their integration.</description>

      <title>Amplified Summer Wind Stilling and Land Warming Compound Energy Risks</title>

Abstract: Wind energy plays a critical role in mitigating climate change and meeting growing energy demands. However, the long-term impacts of anthropogenic warming on wind resources, particularly their seasonal variations and potential compounding risks, remain understudied. Here we analyze large-ensemble, high-resolution climate simulations to assess the projected changes in near-surface wind speed and their implications for wind energy. Our findings reveal robust wind changes including a decrease of land wind speed during the summer months in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes. This stilling is linked to amplified warming of the midlatitude land and the overlying troposphere. The potential impacts of the wind stilling are investigated with scenario-based stress testing. While the impact of wind stilling could potentially make wind energy less competitive compared to other renewable sources, the stilling will unlikely threaten the cost-competitiveness of onshore wind energy relative to fossil fuel-based electricity even in the most adverse scenario. Our analyses also show that the summertime wind stilling coincides with a projected surge in cooling demand, creating a compounding risk that can disrupt the energy supply-demand balance. These findings highlight the importance of considering the seasonal responses of wind resources and the associated compounding climate-energy risks in the warming climate. By integrating these insights into future energy planning decisions, we can better adapt to a changing climate and ensure a reliable and resilient energy future.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the emergence of relaxation-oscillator convection</title>

Abstract: Earth's tropics are characterized by quasi-steady precipitation with small oscillations about a mean value, which has led to the hypothesis that moist convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium (QE). In contrast, very warm simulations of Earth's tropical convection are characterized by relaxation-oscillator-like (RO) precipitation, with short-lived convective storms and torrential rainfall forming and dissipating at regular intervals with little to no precipitation in between. We develop a model of moist convection by combining a zero-buoyancy model of bulk-plume convection with a QE heat engine model, and we use it to show that QE is violated at high surface temperatures. We hypothesize that the RO state emerges when the equilibrium condition of the convective heat engine is violated, i.e., when the heating rate times a thermodynamic efficiency exceeds the rate at which work can be performed. We test our hypothesis against one- and three-dimensional numerical simulations and find that it accurately predicts the onset of RO convection. The proposed mechanism for RO emergence from QE breakdown is agnostic of the condensable, and can be applied to any planetary atmosphere undergoing moist convection. To date, RO states have only been demonstrated in three-dimensional convection-resolving simulations, which has made it seem that the physics of the RO state requires simulations that can explicitly resolve the three-dimensional interaction of cloudy plumes and their environment. We demonstrate that RO states also exist in single-column simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with parameterized convection, albeit in a different surface temperature range and with much longer storm-free intervals.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>
