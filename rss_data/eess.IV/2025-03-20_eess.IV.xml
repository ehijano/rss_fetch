      <title>SDF-TopoNet: A Two-Stage Framework for Tubular Structure Segmentation via SDF Pre-training and Topology-Aware Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular and curvilinear structures, such as blood vessels, neurons, and road networks, is crucial in various applications. A key challenge is ensuring topological correctness while maintaining computational efficiency. Existing approaches often employ topological loss functions based on persistent homology, such as Betti error, to enforce structural consistency. However, these methods suffer from high computational costs and are insensitive to pixel-level accuracy, often requiring additional loss terms like Dice or MSE to compensate. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{SDF-TopoNet}, an improved topology-aware segmentation framework that enhances both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage training strategy. In the pre-training phase, we utilize the signed distance function (SDF) as an auxiliary learning target, allowing the model to encode topological information without directly relying on computationally expensive topological loss functions. In the fine-tuning phase, we incorporate a dynamic adapter alongside a refined topological loss to ensure topological correctness while mitigating overfitting and computational overhead. We evaluate our method on five benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SDF-TopoNet outperforms existing methods in both topological accuracy and quantitative segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing training complexity.</description>

      <title>Spline refinement with differentiable rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting slender, overlapping structures remains a challenge in computational microscopy. While recent coordinate-based approaches improve detection, they often produce less accurate splines than pixel-based methods. We introduce a training-free differentiable rendering approach to spline refinement, achieving both high reliability and sub-pixel accuracy. Our method improves spline quality, enhances robustness to distribution shifts, and shrinks the gap between synthetic and real-world data. Being fully unsupervised, the method is a drop-in replacement for the popular active contour model for spline refinement. Evaluated on C. elegans nematodes, a popular model organism for drug discovery and biomedical research, we demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both coordinate- and pixel-based methods.</description>

The study employs YOLOv8 and repurposed U-Net, two advanced deep learning models, to significantly enhance ship detection accuracy. Evaluation metrics include Mean Average Precision (mAP), processing speed, and overall accuracy. The research utilizes the "Airbus Ship Detection" dataset, featuring diverse remote sensing images, to assess the models' versatility in detecting ships with varying orientations and environmental contexts. Conventional ship detection faces challenges with arbitrary orientations, complex backgrounds, and obscured perspectives. Our approach incorporates YOLOv8 for real-time processing and U-Net for ship instance segmentation. Evaluation focuses on mAP, processing speed, and overall accuracy. The dataset is chosen for its diverse images, making it an ideal benchmark. Results demonstrate significant progress in ship detection. YOLOv8 achieves an 88% mAP, excelling in accurate and rapid ship detection. U Net, adapted for ship instance segmentation, attains an 89% mAP, improving boundary delineation and handling occlusions. This research enhances maritime surveillance, disaster response, and ecological monitoring, exemplifying the potential of deep learning models in ship detection.</description>

      <title>Advancing Chronic Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Vision-Language Models: A Multi modal Framework for Precision Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background This study proposes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging the SIGLIP encoder and Gemma-3b transformer decoder to enhance automated chronic tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images with clinical data, the model addresses the challenges of manual interpretation, improving diagnostic consistency and accessibility, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
  Methods The VLM architecture combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) for visual encoding and a transformer-based text encoder to process clinical context, such as patient histories and treatment records. Cross-modal attention mechanisms align radiographic features with textual information, while the Gemma-3b decoder generates comprehensive diagnostic reports. The model was pre-trained on 5 million paired medical images and texts and fine-tuned using 100,000 chronic TB-specific chest X-rays.
  Results The model demonstrated high precision (94 percent) and recall (94 percent) for detecting key chronic TB pathologies, including fibrosis, calcified granulomas, and bronchiectasis. Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores exceeded 0.93, and Intersection over Union (IoU) values were above 0.91, validating its effectiveness in detecting and localizing TB-related abnormalities.
  Conclusion The VLM offers a robust and scalable solution for automated chronic TB diagnosis, integrating radiographic and clinical data to deliver actionable and context-aware insights. Future work will address subtle pathologies and dataset biases to enhance the model's generalizability, ensuring equitable performance across diverse populations and healthcare settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: This study introduces a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging SIGLIP and Gemma-3b architectures for automated acute tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images and clinical notes, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings.
  Methods: The VLM combines visual data from chest X-rays with clinical context to generate detailed, context-aware diagnostic reports. The architecture employs SIGLIP for visual encoding and Gemma-3b for decoding, ensuring effective representation of acute TB-specific pathologies and clinical insights.
  Results: Key acute TB pathologies, including consolidation, cavities, and nodules, were detected with high precision (97percent) and recall (96percent). The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis.
  Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening. Future work will focus on improving the detection of subtle pathologies and addressing dataset biases to enhance its generalizability and application in diverse global healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Rapid Identification of Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens in Blood Smears of Septic Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Traditional microbiological methods are time-consuming and expensive. In response to these challenges, deep learning algorithms were developed to identify 14 bacteria species and 3 yeast-like fungi from microscopic images of Gram-stained smears of positive blood samples from sepsis patients.
  A total of 16,637 Gram-stained microscopic images were used in the study. The analysis used the Cellpose 3 model for segmentation and Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning for classification. Our model achieved an accuracy of 77.15% for bacteria and 71.39% for fungi, with ROC AUC of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. The highest values, reaching up to 96.2%, were obtained for Cutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Nakaseomyces glabratus. Classification difficulties were observed in closely related species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, due to morphological similarity, and within Candida albicans due to high morphotic diversity.
  The study confirms the potential of our model for microbial classification, but it also indicates the need for further optimisation and expansion of the training data set. In the future, this technology could support microbial diagnosis, reducing diagnostic time and improving the effectiveness of sepsis treatment due to its simplicity and accessibility. Part of the results presented in this publication was covered by a patent application at the European Patent Office EP24461637.1 "A computer implemented method for identifying a microorganism in a blood and a data processing system therefor".</description>

      <title>Novel AI-Based Quantification of Breast Arterial Calcification to Predict Cardiovascular Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Women are underdiagnosed and undertreated for cardiovascular disease. Automatic quantification of breast arterial calcification on screening mammography can identify women at risk for cardiovascular disease and enable earlier treatment and management of disease. In this retrospective study of 116,135 women from two healthcare systems, a transformer-based neural network quantified BAC severity (no BAC, mild, moderate, and severe) on screening mammograms. Outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality. BAC severity was independently associated with MACE after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, with increasing hazard ratios from mild (HR 1.18-1.22), moderate (HR 1.38-1.47), to severe BAC (HR 2.03-2.22) across datasets (all p&lt;0.001). This association remained significant across all age groups, with even mild BAC indicating increased risk in women under 50. BAC remained an independent predictor when analyzed alongside ASCVD risk scores, showing significant associations with myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and mortality (all p&lt;0.005). Automated BAC quantification enables opportunistic cardiovascular risk assessment during routine mammography without additional radiation or cost. This approach provides value beyond traditional risk factors, particularly in younger women, offering potential for early CVD risk stratification in the millions of women undergoing annual mammography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject of research: is the study of methods for analyzing perimetric images for the diagnosis and control of glaucoma diseases. Objects of research: is a dataset collected on the ophthalmological perimeter with the results of various patient pathologies, since the ophthalmological community is acutely aware of the issue of disease control and import substitution. [5]. Purpose of research: is to consider various machine learning methods that can classify glaucoma. This is possible thanks to the classifier built after labeling the dataset. It is able to determine from the image whether the visual fields depicted on it are the results of the impact of glaucoma on the eyes or other visual diseases. Earlier in the work [3], a dataset was described that was collected on the Tomey perimeter. The average age of the examined patients ranged from 30 to 85 years. Methods of research: machine learning methods for classifying image results (stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes). Main results of research: the result of the study is computer modeling that can determine from the image whether the result is glaucoma or another disease (binary classification).</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Reconstruction of the Lumbar Spine with Submillimeter Accuracy Using Biplanar X-ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of the spine under weight-bearing conditions from biplanar X-ray images is of great importance for the clinical assessment of spinal diseases. However, the current fully automated reconstruction methods have low accuracy and fail to meet the clinical application standards. This study developed and validated a fully automated method for high-accuracy 3D reconstruction of the lumbar spine from biplanar X-ray images. The method involves lumbar decomposition and landmark detection from the raw X-ray images, followed by a deformable model and landmark-weighted 2D-3D registration approach. The reconstruction accuracy was validated by the gold standard obtained through the registration of CT-segmented vertebral models with the biplanar X-ray images. The proposed method achieved a 3D reconstruction accuracy of 0.80 mm, representing a significant improvement over the mainstream approaches. This study will contribute to the clinical diagnosis of lumbar in weight-bearing positions.</description>

      <title>Involution and BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced SISR. However, increasing network depth increases parameters, and memory usage, and slows training, which is problematic for resource-limited devices. To address this, lightweight models are developed to balance accuracy and efficiency. We propose the Involution &amp; BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Network (IBMDN), combining Involution &amp; BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Block (IBMDB) and the Contrast and High-Frequency Attention Block (CHFAB). IBMDB integrates Involution and BSConv to balance computational efficiency and feature extraction. CHFAB enhances high-frequency details for better visual quality. IBMDB is compatible with other SISR architectures and reduces complexity, improving evaluation metrics like PSNR and SSIM. In transformer-based models, IBMDB reduces memory usage while improving feature extraction. In GANs, it enhances perceptual quality, balancing pixel-level accuracy with perceptual details. Our experiments show that the method achieves high accuracy with minimal computational cost. The code is available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Degradation Alchemy: Self-Supervised Unknown-to-Known Transformation for Blind Hyperspectral Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion is an efficient technique that combines low-resolution HSI (LR-HSI) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) to generate high-resolution HSI (HR-HSI). Existing supervised learning methods (SLMs) can yield promising results when test data degradation matches the training ones, but they face challenges in generalizing to unknown degradations. To unleash the potential and generalization ability of SLMs, we propose a novel self-supervised unknown-to-known degradation transformation framework (U2K) for blind HSI fusion, which adaptively transforms unknown degradation into the same type of degradation as those handled by pre-trained SLMs. Specifically, the proposed U2K framework consists of: (1) spatial and spectral Degradation Wrapping (DW) modules that map HR-HSI to unknown degraded HR-MSI and LR-HSI, and (2) Degradation Transformation (DT) modules that convert these wrapped data into predefined degradation patterns. The transformed HR-MSI and LR-HSI pairs are then processed by a pre-trained network to reconstruct the target HR-HSI. We train the U2K framework in a self-supervised manner using consistency loss and greedy alternating optimization, significantly improving the flexibility of blind HSI fusion. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed U2K framework in boosting the adaptability of five existing SLMs under various degradation settings and surpassing state-of-the-art blind methods.</description>

      <title>FetalFlex: Anatomy-Guided Diffusion Model for Flexible Control on Fetal Ultrasound Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal ultrasound (US) examinations require the acquisition of multiple planes, each providing unique diagnostic information to evaluate fetal development and screening for congenital anomalies. However, obtaining a comprehensive, multi-plane annotated fetal US dataset remains challenging, particularly for rare or complex anomalies owing to their low incidence and numerous subtypes. This poses difficulties in training novice radiologists and developing robust AI models, especially for detecting abnormal fetuses. In this study, we introduce a Flexible Fetal US image generation framework (FetalFlex) to address these challenges, which leverages anatomical structures and multimodal information to enable controllable synthesis of fetal US images across diverse planes. Specifically, FetalFlex incorporates a pre-alignment module to enhance controllability and introduces a repaint strategy to ensure consistent texture and appearance. Moreover, a two-stage adaptive sampling strategy is developed to progressively refine image quality from coarse to fine levels. We believe that FetalFlex is the first method capable of generating both in-distribution normal and out-of-distribution abnormal fetal US images, without requiring any abnormal data. Experiments on multi-center datasets demonstrate that FetalFlex achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple image quality metrics.

      <title>A Language Vision Model Approach for Automated Tumor Contouring in Radiation Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Lung cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The complexity of tumor delineation, crucial for radiation therapy, requires expertise often unavailable in resource-limited settings. Artificial Intelligence(AI), particularly with advancements in deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP), offers potential solutions yet is challenged by high false positive rates. Purpose: The Oncology Contouring Copilot (OCC) system is developed to leverage oncologist expertise for precise tumor contouring using textual descriptions, aiming to increase the efficiency of oncological workflows by combining the strengths of AI with human oversight. Methods: Our OCC system initially identifies nodule candidates from CT scans. Employing Language Vision Models (LVMs) like GPT-4V, OCC then effectively reduces false positives with clinical descriptive texts, merging textual and visual data to automate tumor delineation, designed to elevate the quality of oncology care by incorporating knowledge from experienced domain experts. Results: Deployments of the OCC system resulted in a significant reduction in the false discovery rate by 35.0%, a 72.4% decrease in false positives per scan, and an F1-score of 0.652 across our dataset for unbiased evaluation. Conclusions: OCC represents a significant advance in oncology care, particularly through the use of the latest LVMs to improve contouring results by (1) streamlining oncology treatment workflows by optimizing tumor delineation, reducing manual processes; (2) offering a scalable and intuitive framework to reduce false positives in radiotherapy planning using LVMs; (3) introducing novel medical language vision prompt techniques to minimize LVMs hallucinations with ablation study, and (4) conducting a comparative analysis of LVMs, highlighting their potential in addressing medical language vision challenges.</description>

      <title>A Novel Channel Boosted Residual CNN-Transformer with Regional-Boundary Learning for Breast Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in detecting tumors using deep learning on breast ultrasound images (BUSI) have demonstrated significant success. Deep CNNs and vision-transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated individually promising initial performance. However, challenges related to model complexity and contrast, texture, and tumor morphology variations introduce uncertainties that hinder the effectiveness of current methods. This study introduces a novel hybrid framework, CB-Res-RBCMT, combining customized residual CNNs and new ViT components for detailed BUSI cancer analysis. The proposed RBCMT uses stem convolution blocks with CNN Meet Transformer (CMT) blocks, followed by new Regional and boundary (RB) feature extraction operations for capturing contrast and morphological variations. Moreover, the CMT block incorporates global contextual interactions through multi-head attention, enhancing computational efficiency with a lightweight design. Additionally, the customized inverse residual and stem CNNs within the CMT effectively extract local texture information and handle vanishing gradients. Finally, the new channel-boosted (CB) strategy enriches the feature diversity of the limited dataset by combining the original RBCMT channels with transfer learning-based residual CNN-generated maps. These diverse channels are processed through a spatial attention block for optimal pixel selection, reducing redundancy and improving the discrimination of minor contrast and texture variations. The proposed CB-Res-RBCMT achieves an F1-score of 95.57%, accuracy of 95.63%, sensitivity of 96.42%, and precision of 94.79% on the standard harmonized stringent BUSI dataset, outperforming existing ViT and CNN methods. These results demonstrate the versatility of our integrated CNN-Transformer framework in capturing diverse features and delivering superior performance in BUSI cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Texture-Aware StarGAN for CT data harmonisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in medical diagnosis; however, variability across reconstruction kernels hinders data-driven approaches, such as deep learning models, from achieving reliable and generalized performance. To this end, CT data harmonization has emerged as a promising solution to minimize such non-biological variances by standardizing data across different sources or conditions. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proved to be a powerful framework for harmonization, framing it as a style-transfer problem. However, GAN-based approaches still face limitations in capturing complex relationships within the images, which are essential for effective harmonization. In this work, we propose a novel texture-aware StarGAN for CT data harmonization, enabling one-to-many translations across different reconstruction kernels. Although the StarGAN model has been successfully applied in other domains, its potential for CT data harmonization remains unexplored. Furthermore, our approach introduces a multi-scale texture loss function that embeds texture information across different spatial and angular scales into the harmonization process, effectively addressing kernel-induced texture variations. We conducted extensive experimentation on a publicly available dataset, utilizing a total of 48667 chest CT slices from 197 patients distributed over three different reconstruction kernels, demonstrating the superiority of our method over the baseline StarGAN.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Vision Language Foundation Models for Ocular Disease Screening in Retinal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale versatile systems trained on vast quantities of diverse data to learn generalizable representations. Their adaptability with minimal fine-tuning makes them particularly promising for medical imaging, where data variability and domain shifts are major challenges. Currently, two types of foundation models dominate the literature: self-supervised models and more recent vision-language models. In this study, we advance the application of vision-language foundation (VLF) models for ocular disease screening using the OPHDIAT dataset, which includes nearly 700,000 fundus photographs from a French diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening network. This dataset provides extensive clinical data (patient-specific information such as diabetic health conditions, and treatments), labeled diagnostics, ophthalmologists text-based findings, and multiple retinal images for each examination. Building on the FLAIR model $\unicode{x2013}$ a VLF model for retinal pathology classification $\unicode{x2013}$ we propose novel context-aware VLF models (e.g jointly analyzing multiple images from the same visit or taking advantage of past diagnoses and contextual data) to fully leverage the richness of the OPHDIAT dataset and enhance robustness to domain shifts. Our approaches were evaluated on both in-domain (a testing subset of OPHDIAT) and out-of-domain data (public datasets) to assess their generalization performance. Our model demonstrated improved in-domain performance for DR grading, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.851 to 0.9999, and generalized well to ocular disease detection on out-of-domain data (AUC: 0.631-0.913).</description>

      <title>FedSCA: Federated Tuning with Similarity-guided Collaborative Aggregation for Heterogeneous Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models (FMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in medical image segmentation. However, scaling these models is challenging due to the limited size of medical image datasets within isolated hospitals, where data centralization is restricted due to privacy concerns. These constraints, combined with the data-intensive nature of FMs, hinder their broader application. Integrating federated learning (FL) with foundation models (FLFM) fine-tuning offers a potential solution to these challenges by enabling collaborative model training without data sharing, thus allowing FMs to take advantage of a diverse pool of sensitive medical image data across hospitals/clients. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients, paired with computational and communication constraints in federated environments, presents an additional challenge that limits further performance improvements and remains inadequately addressed in existing studies. In this work, we propose a novel FLFM fine-tuning framework, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated tuning with \underline{\textbf{S}}imilarity-guided \underline{\textbf{C}}ollaborative \underline{\textbf{A}}ggregation (FedSCA), encompassing all phases of the FL process. This includes (1) specially designed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for local client training to enhance computational efficiency; (2) partial low-level adapter transmission for communication efficiency; and (3) similarity-guided collaborative aggregation (SGCA) on the server side to address non-IID issues. Extensive experiments on three FL benchmarks for medical image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FedSCA, establishing new SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual 3D Segmentation With Single-round Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning seeks to foster collaboration among distributed clients while preserving the privacy of their local data. Traditionally, federated learning methods assume a fixed setting in which client data and learning objectives remain constant. However, in real-world scenarios, new clients may join, and existing clients may expand the segmentation label set as task requirements evolve. In such a dynamic federated analysis setup, the conventional federated communication strategy of model aggregation per communication round is suboptimal. As new clients join, this strategy requires retraining, linearly increasing communication and computation overhead. It also imposes requirements for synchronized communication, which is difficult to achieve among distributed clients. In this paper, we propose a federated continual learning strategy that employs a one-time model aggregation at the server through multi-model distillation. This approach builds and updates the global model while eliminating the need for frequent server communication. When integrating new data streams or onboarding new clients, this approach efficiently reuses previous client models, avoiding the need to retrain the global model across the entire federation. By minimizing communication load and bypassing the need to put unchanged clients online, our approach relaxes synchronization requirements among clients, providing an efficient and scalable federated analysis framework suited for real-world applications. Using multi-class 3D abdominal CT segmentation as an application task, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscience to study how the joint activity of large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed for imaging deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is in computational imaging: the co-development of optics and algorithms where the optics are designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, and the algorithms compensate by inverting the optical image coding process to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopic video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the information loss by extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to integrate the fluorescence of neighboring lines into a single set of measurements. By imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame, NORA diversifies the information collected across frames and enables video-level reconstruction. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame using image-level recovery, NORA recovers full video sequences through a nuclear-norm minimization (i.e., matrix completion) on the pixels-by-time matrix. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulation suite. Using these simulations we demonstrate that NORA imaging can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation of Body Motion Data by Neural Gas Network for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of emotion recognition using body motion, the primary challenge lies in the scarcity of diverse and generalizable datasets. Automatic emotion recognition uses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to recognize a person's emotional state from various data types, such as text, images, sound, and body motion. Body motion poses unique challenges as many factors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and illness, affect its appearance, leading to a lack of diverse and robust datasets specifically for emotion recognition. To address this, employing Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs), offers potential solutions, though these methods are often complex. This research introduces a novel application of the Neural Gas Network (NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data and optimizing diversity and generation speed. By learning skeletal structure topology, the NGN fits the neurons or gas particles on body joints. Generated gas particles, which form the skeletal structure later on, will be used to synthesize the new body posture. By attaching body postures over frames, the final synthetic body motion appears. We compared our generated dataset against others generated by GANs, VAEs, and another benchmark algorithm, using benchmark metrics such as Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity, and a few more. Furthermore, we continued evaluation using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a few others. Joint-related features or kinematic parameters were extracted, and the system assessed model performance against unseen data. Our findings demonstrate that the NGN algorithm produces more realistic and emotionally distinct body motion data and does so with more synthesizing speed than existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called \emph{Content ARCs} (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Unsupervised Joint Denoising and Enhancement for Real-World low-light Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world low-light images often suffer from complex degradations such as local overexposure, low brightness, noise, and uneven illumination. Supervised methods tend to overfit to specific scenarios, while unsupervised methods, though better at generalization, struggle to model these degradations due to the lack of reference images. To address this issue, we propose an interpretable, zero-reference joint denoising and low-light enhancement framework tailored for real-world scenarios. Our method derives a training strategy based on paired sub-images with varying illumination and noise levels, grounded in physical imaging principles and retinex theory. Additionally, we leverage the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to perform frequency domain decomposition in the sRGB space, and introduce an implicit-guided hybrid representation strategy that effectively separates intricate compounded degradations. In the backbone network design, we develop retinal decomposition network guided by implicit degradation representation mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Code will be available at https://github.com/huaqlili/unsupervised-light-enhance-ICLR2025.</description>

      <title>Core-Periphery Principle Guided State Space Model for Functional Connectome Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the organization of human brain networks has become a central focus in neuroscience, particularly in the study of functional connectivity, which plays a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders. Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques have significantly improved brain network analysis. However, traditional machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex relationships between brain regions, while deep learning methods, particularly Transformer-based models, face computational challenges due to their quadratic complexity in long-sequence modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Core-Periphery State-Space Model (CP-SSM), an innovative framework for functional connectome classification. Specifically, we introduce Mamba, a selective state-space model with linear complexity, to effectively capture long-range dependencies in functional brain networks. Furthermore, inspired by the core-periphery (CP) organization, a fundamental characteristic of brain networks that enhances efficient information transmission, we design CP-MoE, a CP-guided Mixture-of-Experts that improves the representation learning of brain connectivity patterns. We evaluate CP-SSM on two benchmark fMRI datasets: ABIDE and ADNI. Experimental results demonstrate that CP-SSM surpasses Transformer-based models in classification performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of CP-SSM in modeling brain functional connectivity, offering a promising direction for neuroimaging-based neurological disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Image-to-Video Synthesis via Latent Dynamic Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound video classification enables automated diagnosis and has emerged as an important research area. However, publicly available ultrasound video datasets remain scarce, hindering progress in developing effective video classification models. We propose addressing this shortage by synthesizing plausible ultrasound videos from readily available, abundant ultrasound images. To this end, we introduce a latent dynamic diffusion model (LDDM) to efficiently translate static images to dynamic sequences with realistic video characteristics. We demonstrate strong quantitative results and visually appealing synthesized videos on the BUSV benchmark. Notably, training video classification models on combinations of real and LDDM-synthesized videos substantially improves performance over using real data alone, indicating our method successfully emulates dynamics critical for discrimination. Our image-to-video approach provides an effective data augmentation solution to advance ultrasound video analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/MedAITech/U_I2V.</description>

Abstract: During the compression, transmission, and rendering of point clouds, various artifacts are introduced, affecting the quality perceived by the end user. However, evaluating the impact of these distortions on the overall quality is a challenging task. This study introduces PST-PCQA, a no-reference point cloud quality metric based on a low-complexity, learning-based framework. It evaluates point cloud quality by analyzing individual patches, integrating local and global features to predict the Mean Opinion Score. In summary, the process involves extracting features from patches, combining them, and using correlation weights to predict the overall quality. This approach allows us to assess point cloud quality without relying on a reference point cloud, making it particularly useful in scenarios where reference data is unavailable. Experimental tests on three state-of-the-art datasets show good prediction capabilities of PST-PCQA, through the analysis of different feature pooling strategies and its ability to generalize across different datasets. The ablation study confirms the benefits of evaluating quality on a patch-by-patch basis. Additionally, PST-PCQA's light-weight structure, with a small number of parameters to learn, makes it well-suited for real-time applications and devices with limited computational capacity. For reproducibility purposes, we made code, model, and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/michaelneri/PST-PCQA.</description>

      <title>Medical Image Fusion for High-Level Analysis: A Mutual Enhancement Framework for Unaligned PAT and MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) offers optical contrast, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excels in imaging soft tissue and organ anatomy. The fusion of PAT with MRI holds promising application prospects due to their complementary advantages. Existing image fusion have made considerable progress in pre-registered images, yet spatial deformations are difficult to avoid in medical imaging scenarios. More importantly, current algorithms focus on visual quality and statistical metrics, thus overlooking the requirements of high-level tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised fusion model, termed PAMRFuse+, which integrates image generation and registration. Specifically, a cross-modal style transfer network is introduced to simplify cross-modal registration to single-modal registration. Subsequently, a multi-level registration network is employed to predict displacement vector fields. Furthermore, a dual-branch feature decomposition fusion network is proposed to address the challenges of cross-modal feature modeling and decomposition by integrating modality-specific and modality-shared features. PAMRFuse+ achieves satisfactory results in registering and fusing unaligned PAT-MRI datasets. Moreover, for the first time, we evaluate the performance of medical image fusion with multi-organ instance segmentation. Extensive experimental demonstrations reveal the advantages of PAMRFuse+ in improving the performance of medical image analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>Skin Cancer Machine Learning Model Tone Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Many open-source skin cancer image datasets are the result of clinical trials conducted in countries with lighter skin tones. Due to this tone imbalance, machine learning models derived from these datasets can perform well at detecting skin cancer for lighter skin tones. Any tone bias in these models could introduce fairness concerns and reduce public trust in the artificial intelligence health field.
  Methods: We examine a subset of images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive that provide tone information. The subset has a significant tone imbalance. These imbalances could explain a model's tone bias. To address this, we train models using the imbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset to compare against. The datasets are used to train a deep convolutional neural network model to classify the images as malignant or benign. We then evaluate the models' disparate impact, based on selection rate, relative to dark or light skin tone.
  Results: Using the imbalanced dataset, we found that the model is significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter tone resulting in a disparate impact of 0.577. Using the balanced dataset, we found that the model is also significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter versus darker tones with a disparate impact of 0.684. Using the imbalanced or balanced dataset to train the model still results in a disparate impact well below the standard threshold of 0.80 which suggests the model is biased with respect to skin tone.
  Conclusion: The results show that typical skin cancer machine learning models can be tone biased. These results provide evidence that diagnosis or tone imbalance is not the cause of the bias. Other techniques will be necessary to identify and address the bias in these models, an area of future investigation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the automatic segmentation and analysis of 3D liver vasculature models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15778v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Pipeline for Fully Automated Myocardial Infarct Segmentation from Clinical Cardiac MR Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning-based method that allows to perform myocardial infarct segmentation in a fully-automated way.
  Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, a cascaded framework of two and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specialized on identifying ischemic myocardial scars on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, was trained on an in-house training dataset consisting of 144 examinations. On a separate test dataset from the same institution, including images from 152 examinations obtained between 2021 and 2023, a quantitative comparison between artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentations and manual segmentations was performed. Further, qualitative assessment of segmentation accuracy was evaluated for both human and AI-generated contours by two CMR experts in a blinded experiment.
  Results: Excellent agreement could be found between manually and automatically calculated infarct volumes ($\rho_c$ = 0.9). The qualitative evaluation showed that compared to human-based measurements, the experts rated the AI-based segmentations to better represent the actual extent of infarction significantly (p &lt; 0.001) more often (33.4% AI, 25.1% human, 41.5% equal). On the contrary, for segmentation of microvascular obstruction (MVO), manual measurements were still preferred (11.3% AI, 55.6% human, 33.1% equal).
  Conclusion: This fully-automated segmentation pipeline enables CMR infarct size to be calculated in a very short time and without requiring any pre-processing of the input images while matching the segmentation quality of trained human observers. In a blinded experiment, experts preferred automated infarct segmentations more often than manual segmentations, paving the way for a potential clinical application.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Random Fields as an Abstract Representation of Patient Metadata for Multimodal Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: The growing rate of chronic wound occurrence, especially in patients with diabetes, has become a concerning trend in recent years. Chronic wounds are difficult and costly to treat, and have become a serious burden on health care systems worldwide. Chronic wounds can have devastating consequences for the patient, with infection often leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. Innovative deep learning methods for the detection and monitoring of such wounds have the potential to reduce the impact to both patient and clinician. We present a novel multimodal segmentation method which allows for the introduction of patient metadata into the training workflow whereby the patient data are expressed as Gaussian random fields. Our results indicate that the proposed method improved performance when utilising multiple models, each trained on different metadata categories. Using the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 test set, when compared to the baseline results (intersection over union = 0.4670, Dice similarity coefficient = 0.5908) we demonstrate improvements of +0.0220 and +0.0229 for intersection over union and Dice similarity coefficient respectively. This paper presents the first study to focus on integrating patient data into a chronic wound segmentation workflow. Our results show significant performance gains when training individual models using specific metadata categories, followed by average merging of prediction masks using distance transforms.

      <title>AI and Deep Learning for Automated Segmentation and Quantitative Measurement of Spinal Structures in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Accurate spinal structure measurement is crucial for assessing spine health and diagnosing conditions like spondylosis, disc herniation, and stenosis. Manual methods for measuring intervertebral disc height and spinal canal diameter are subjective and time-consuming. Automated solutions are needed to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility in clinical practice.
  Purpose: This study develops an autonomous AI system for segmenting and measuring key spinal structures in MRI scans, focusing on intervertebral disc height and spinal canal anteroposterior (AP) diameter in the cervical, lumbar, and thoracic regions. The goal is to reduce clinician workload, enhance diagnostic consistency, and improve assessments.
  Methods: The AI model leverages deep learning architectures, including UNet, nnU-Net, and CNNs. Trained on a large proprietary MRI dataset, it was validated against expert annotations. Performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients and segmentation accuracy.
  Results: The AI model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.94 for lumbar, 0.91 for cervical, and 0.90 for dorsal spine segmentation (D1-D12). It precisely measured spinal parameters like disc height and canal diameter, demonstrating robustness and clinical applicability.
  Conclusion: The AI system effectively automates MRI-based spinal measurements, improving accuracy and reducing clinician workload. Its consistent performance across spinal regions supports clinical decision-making, particularly in high-demand settings, enhancing spinal assessments and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>DCAT: Dual Cross-Attention Fusion for Disease Classification in Radiological Images with Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable image classification is crucial in radiology, where diagnostic decisions significantly impact patient outcomes. Conventional deep learning models tend to produce overconfident predictions despite underlying uncertainties, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input data. Combined with feature fusion, they can be effective in addressing uncertainty challenges. Cross-attention has become increasingly important in medical image analysis for capturing dependencies across features and modalities. This paper proposes a novel dual cross-attention fusion model for medical image analysis by addressing key challenges in feature integration and interpretability. Our approach introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism with refined channel and spatial attention that dynamically fuses feature maps from EfficientNetB4 and ResNet34 leveraging multi-network contextual dependencies. The refined features through channel and spatial attention highlights discriminative patterns crucial for accurate classification. The proposed model achieved AUC of 99.75%, 100%, 99.93% and 98.69% and AUPR of 99.81%, 100%, 99.97%, and 96.36% on Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia Chest X-ray images and Retinal OCT images respectively. The entropy values and several high uncertain samples give an interpretable visualization from the model enhancing transparency. By combining multi-scale feature extraction, bidirectional attention and uncertainty estimation, our proposed model strongly impacts medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>CTSR: Controllable Fidelity-Realness Trade-off Distillation for Real-World Image Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution is a critical image processing task, where two key evaluation criteria are the fidelity to the original image and the visual realness of the generated results. Although existing methods based on diffusion models excel in visual realness by leveraging strong priors, they often struggle to achieve an effective balance between fidelity and realness. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that a linear combination of multiple models outperforms individual models, motivating us to harness the strengths of different models for a more effective trade-off. Based on this insight, we propose a distillation-based approach that leverages the geometric decomposition of both fidelity and realness, alongside the performance advantages of multiple teacher models, to strike a more balanced trade-off. Furthermore, we explore the controllability of this trade-off, enabling a flexible and adjustable super-resolution process, which we call CTSR (Controllable Trade-off Super-Resolution). Experiments conducted on several real-world image super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across both fidelity and realness metrics.</description>
