      <title>Shifting the yield curve for fixed-income and derivatives portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use granular regulatory data on euro interest rate swap trades between January 2021 and June 2023 to assess whether derivative positions of Italian banks can offset losses on their debt securities holdings should interest rates rise unexpectedly. At the aggregate level of the banking system, we find that a 100-basis-point upward shift of the yield curve increases on average the value of swaps by 3.65% of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), compensating in part for the losses of 2.64% and 5.98% of CET1 recorded on debt securities valued at fair value and amortised cost. Variation exists across institutions, with some bank swap positions playing an offsetting role and some exacerbating bond market exposures to interest rate risk. Nevertheless, we conclude that, on aggregate, Italian banks use swaps as hedging instruments to reduce their interest rate exposures, which improves their ability to cope with the recent tightening of monetary policy. Finally, we draw on our swap pricing model to conduct an extensive data quality analysis of the transaction-level information available to authorities, and we show that the errors in fitting value changes over time are significantly lower compared to those in fitting the values themselves.</description>

      <title>Refining and Robust Backtesting of A Century of Profitable Industry Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the long-only trend-following strategy presented in A Century of Profitable Industry Trends by Zarattini and Antonacci, which achieved exceptional historical performance with an 18.2% annualized return and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.39. While the results outperformed benchmarks, practical implementation raises concerns about robustness and evolving market conditions. This study explores modifications addressing reliance on T-bills, alternative fallback allocations, and industry exclusions. Despite attempts to enhance adaptability through momentum signals, parameter optimization, and Walk-Forward Analysis, results reveal persistent challenges. The results highlight challenges in adapting historical strategies to modern markets and offer insights for future trend-following frameworks.</description>

      <title>A semi-parametric dynamic conditional correlation framework for risk forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel multivariate semi-parametric framework for joint portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) forecasting. Unlike existing univariate semi-parametric approaches, the proposed framework explicitly models the dependence structure among portfolio asset returns through a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) parameterization. To estimate the model, a two-step procedure based on the minimization of a strictly consistent VaR and ES joint loss function is employed. This procedure allows to simultaneously estimate the DCC parameters and the portfolio risk factors. The performance of the proposed model in risk forecasting on various probability levels is evaluated by means of a forecasting study on the components of the Dow Jones index for an out-of-sample period from December 2016 to September 2021. The empirical results support effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to a variety of existing approaches.</description>
