      <title>On fusing active and passive acoustic sensing for simultaneous localization and mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on the social behaviors of bats show that they have the ability to eavesdrop on the signals emitted by conspecifics in their vicinity. They can fuse this ``passive" data with actively collected data from their own signals to get more information about their environment, allowing them to fly and hunt more efficiently and to avoid or cause jamming when competing for prey. Acoustic sensors are capable of similar feats but are generally used in only an active or passive capacity at one time. Is there a benefit to using both active and passive sensing simultaneously in the same array? In this work we define a family of models for active, passive, and fused sensing systems to measure range and bearing data from an environment defined by point-based landmarks. These measurements are used to solve the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with extended Kalman filter (EKF) and FastSLAM 2.0 approaches. Our results show agreement with previous findings. Specifically, when active sensing is limited to a narrow angular range, fused sensing can perform just as accurately if not better, while also allowing the sensor to perceive more of the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>A Massive MIMO Sampling Detection Strategy Based on Denoising Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Langevin sampling method relies on an accurate score matching while the existing massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) Langevin detection involves an inevitable singular value decomposition (SVD) to calculate the posterior score. In this work, a massive MIMO sampling detection strategy that leverages the denoising diffusion model is proposed to narrow the gap between the given iterative detector and the maximum likelihood (ML) detection in an SVD-free manner. Specifically, the proposed score-based sampling detection strategy, denoted as approximate diffusion detection (ADD), is applicable to a wide range of iterative detection methods, and therefore entails a considerable potential in their performance improvement by multiple sampling attempts. On the other hand, the ADD scheme manages to bypass the channel SVD by introducing a reliable iterative detector to produce a sample from the approximate posterior, so that further Langevin sampling is tractable. Customized by the conjugated gradient descent algorithm as an instance, the proposed sampling scheme outperforms the existing score-based detector in terms of a better complexity-performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>BERT: Accelerating Vital Signs Measurement for Bioradar with An Efficient Recursive Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the great advance of bioradar system in smart sensing of vital signs (VS) for human healthcare monitoring. As an important part of VS sensing process, VS measurement aims to capture the chest wall micromotion induced by the human respiratory and cardiac activities. Unfortunately, the existing VS measurement methods using bioradar have encountered bottlenecks in making a trade-off between time cost and measurement accuracy. To break this bottleneck, this letter proposes an efficient recursive technique (BERT) heuristically, based on the observation that the features of bioradar VS meet the conditions of Markov model. Extensive experimental results validate that BERT measurement yields lower time costs, competitive estimates of heart rate, breathing rate, and heart rate variability. Our BERT method is promising us a new and superior option to measure VS for bioradar. This work seeks not only to solve the current issue of how to accelerate VS measurement with an acceptable accuracy, but also to inspire creative new ideas that spur further advances in this promising field in the future.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Condition Monitoring Method for Capacitor in Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a topology that consists of a high number of capacitors, and degradation of capacitors can lead to converter malfunction, limiting the overall system lifetime. Condition monitoring methods can be applied to assess the health status of capacitors and realize predictive maintenance to improve reliability. Current research works for condition monitoring of capacitors in an MMC mainly monitor either capacitance or equivalent series resistance (ESR), while these two health indicators can shift at different speeds and lead to different end-of-life times. Hence, monitoring only one of these parameters may lead to unreliable health status evaluation. This paper proposes a data-driven method to estimate capacitance and ESR at the same time, in which particle swarm optimization (PSO) is leveraged to update the obtained estimations. Then, the results of the estimations are used to predict the sub-module voltage, which is based on a capacitor voltage equation. Furthermore, minimizing the mean square error between the predicted and actual measured voltage makes the estimations closer to the actual values. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are validated through simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>In-situ process monitoring and adaptive quality enhancement in laser additive manufacturing: a critical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) presents unparalleled opportunities for fabricating complex, high-performance structures and components with unique material properties. Despite these advancements, achieving consistent part quality and process repeatability remains challenging. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various state-of-the-art in-situ process monitoring techniques, including optical-based monitoring, acoustic-based sensing, laser line scanning, and operando X-ray monitoring. These techniques are evaluated for their capabilities and limitations in detecting defects within Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and Laser Directed Energy Deposition (LDED) processes. Furthermore, the review discusses emerging multisensor monitoring and machine learning (ML)-assisted defect detection methods, benchmarking ML models tailored for in-situ defect detection. The paper also discusses in-situ adaptive defect remediation strategies that advance LAM towards zero-defect autonomous operations, focusing on real-time closed-loop feedback control and defect correction methods. Research gaps such as the need for standardization, improved reliability and sensitivity, and decision-making strategies beyond early stopping are highlighted. Future directions are proposed, with an emphasis on multimodal sensor fusion for multiscale defect prediction and fault diagnosis, ultimately enabling self-adaptation in LAM processes. This paper aims to equip researchers and industry professionals with a holistic understanding of the current capabilities, limitations, and future directions in in-situ process monitoring and adaptive quality enhancement in LAM.</description>

      <title>Emerging Advancements in 6G NTN Radio Access Technologies: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efforts on the development, standardization and improvements to communication systems towards 5G Advanced and 6G are on track to provide benefits such as an unprecedented level of connectivity and performance, enabling a diverse range of vertical services. The full integration of non-terrestrial components into 6G plays a pivotal role in realizing this paradigm shift towards ubiquitous communication and global coverage. However, this integration into 6G brings forth a set of its own challenges, particularly in Radio Access Technologies (RATs). To this end, this paper comprehensively discusses those challenges at different levels of RATs and proposes the corresponding potential emerging advancements in the realm of 6G NTN. In particular, the focus is on advancing the prospective aspects of Radio Resource Management (RRM), spectral coexistence in terrestrial and non-terrestrial components and flexible waveform design solutions to combat the impediments. This discussion with a specific focus on emerging advancements in 6G NTN RATs is critical for shaping the next generation networks and potentially relevant in contributing the part in standardization in forthcoming releases</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), achieving effective radio resource allocation across multi-satellite system, encompassing efficient channel and bandwidth allocation, effective beam management, power control and interference mitigation, poses significant challenges due to the varying satellite links and highly dynamic nature of user traffic. This calls for the development of an intelligent decision-making controller using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to efficiently manage resources in this complex environment. In this context, open datasets can play a crucial role in driving new advancement and facilitating research. Recognizing the significance, this paper aims to contribute the satellite communication research community by providing various open datasets that incorporate realistic traffic flow enabling a variety of uses cases. The primary objective of sharing these datasets is to facilitate the development and benchmarking of advanced resource management solutions, thereby improving the overall satellite communication systems. Furthermore, an application example focused on beam placement optimization via terminal clustering is provided. This assists in optimizing beam allocation task, enabling adaptive beamforming to effectively meet spatiotemporally varying user traffic demands and optimize resource utilization.</description>

      <title>GNSS Measurement-Based Context Recognition for Vehicle Navigation using Gated Recurrent Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years, people have put forward higher and higher requirements for context-adaptive navigation (CAN). CAN system realizes seamless navigation in complex environments by recognizing the ambient surroundings of vehicles, and it is crucial to develop a fast, reliable, and robust navigational context recognition (NCR) method to enable CAN systems to operate effectively. Environmental context recognition based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements has attracted widespread attention due to its low cost because it does not require additional infrastructure. The performance and application value of NCR methods depend on three main factors: context categorization, feature extraction, and classification models. In this paper, a fine-grained context categorization framework comprising seven environment categories (open sky, tree-lined avenue, semi-outdoor, urban canyon, viaduct-down, shallow indoor, and deep indoor) is proposed, which currently represents the most elaborate context categorization framework known in this research domain. To improve discrimination between categories, a new feature called the C/N0-weighted azimuth distribution factor, is designed. Then, to ensure real-time performance, a lightweight gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is adopted for its excellent sequence data processing capabilities. A dataset containing 59,996 samples is created and made publicly available to researchers in the NCR community on Github. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the dataset, and the results show that the proposed method achieves an overall recognition accuracy of 99.41\% for isolated scenarios and 94.95\% for transition scenarios, with an average transition delay of 2.14 seconds.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence Assisted Wireless Sensing: Human Flow Detection in Practical Communication Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groundbreaking applications such as ChatGPT have heightened research interest in generative artificial intelligence (GAI). Essentially, GAI excels not only in content generation but also in signal processing, offering support for wireless sensing. Hence, we introduce a novel GAI-assisted human flow detection system (G-HFD). Rigorously, G-HFD first uses channel state information (CSI) to estimate the velocity and acceleration of propagation path length change of the human-induced reflection (HIR). Then, given the strong inference ability of the diffusion model, we propose a unified weighted conditional diffusion model (UW-CDM) to denoise the estimation results, enabling the detection of the number of targets. Next, we use the CSI obtained by a uniform linear array with wavelength spacing to estimate the HIR's time of flight and direction of arrival (DoA). In this process, UW-CDM solves the problem of ambiguous DoA spectrum, ensuring accurate DoA estimation. Finally, through clustering, G-HFD determines the number of subflows and the number of targets in each subflow, i.e., the subflow size. The evaluation based on practical downlink communication signals shows G-HFD's accuracy of subflow size detection can reach 91%. This validates its effectiveness and underscores the significant potential of GAI in the context of wireless sensing.</description>

      <title>Localization Based on MIMO Backscattering from Retro-Directive Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In next-generation vehicular environments, precise localization is crucial for facilitating advanced applications such as autonomous driving. As automation levels escalate, the demand rises for enhanced accuracy, reliability, energy efficiency, update rate, and reduced latency in position information delivery. In this paper, we propose the exploitation of backscattering from retro-directive antenna arrays (RAAs) to address these imperatives. We introduce and discuss two RAA-based architectures designed for various applications, including network localization and navigation. These architectures enable swift and simple angle-of-arrival estimation by using signals backscattered from RAAs. They also leverage multiple antennas to capitalize on multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) gains, thereby addressing the challenges posed by the inherent path loss in backscatter communication, especially when operating at high frequencies. Consequently, angle-based localization becomes achievable with remarkably low latency, ideal for mobile and vehicular applications. This paper introduces ad-hoc signalling and processing schemes for this purpose, and their performance is analytically investigated. Numerical results underscore the potential of these schemes, offering precise and ultra-low-latency localization with low complexity and ultra-low energy consumption devices.</description>

      <title>Fidelitous Augmentation of Human Accelerometric Data for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series (TS) data have consistently been in short supply, yet their demand remains high for training systems in prediction, modeling, classification, and various other applications. Synthesis can serve to expand the sample population, yet it is crucial to maintain the statistical characteristics between the synthesized and the original TS : this ensures consistent sampling of data for both training and testing purposes. However the time domain features of the data may not be maintained. This motivates for our work, the objective which is to preserve the following features in a synthesized TS: its fundamental statistical characteristics and important time domain features like its general shape and prominent transients. In a novel way, we first isolate important TS features into various components using a spectrogram and singular spectrum analysis. The residual signal is then randomized in a way that preserves its statistical properties. These components are then recombined for the synthetic time series. Using accelerometer data in a clinical setting, we use statistical and shape measures to compare our method to others. We show it has higher fidelity to the original signal features, has good diversity and performs better data classification in a deep learning application.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fusion for 802.11ax Wi-Fi-based Passive Radars Exploiting Beamforming Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive Wi-Fi-based radars (PWRs) are devices that enable the localization of targets using Wi-Fi signals of opportunity transmitted by an access point. Unlike active radars that optimize their transmitted waveform for localization, PWRs align with the 802.11 amendments. Specifically, during the channel sounding session preceding a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output downlink transmission, an access point isotropically transmits a null data packet (NDP) with a known preamble. From these known symbols, client user equipments derive their channel state information and transmit an unencrypted beamforming feedback (BFF) back to the access point. The BFF comprises the right singular matrix of the channel and the corresponding stream gain for each subcarrier, which allows the computation of a beamforming matrix at the access point. In a classical PWR processing, only the preamble symbols from the NDP are exploited during the channel sounding session. In this study, we investigate multiple target localization by a PWR exploiting hybrid information sources. On one hand, the joint angle-of-departure and angle-of-arrival evaluated from the NDP. On another hand, the line-of-sight angle-of-departures inferred from the BFFs. The processing steps at the PWR are defined and an optimal hybrid fusion rule is derived in the maximum likelihood framework. Monte-Carlo simulations assess the enhanced accuracy of the proposed combination method compared to classical PWR processing based solely on the NDP, and compare the localisation performance between client and non-client targets.</description>

      <title>Implementing Hottopixx Methods for Endmember Extraction in Hyperspectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. Endmember extraction of hyperspectral images is a key step in leveraging this technology for applications. It aims to identifying the spectral signatures of materials, i.e., the major components in the observed scenes. Theoretically speaking, Hottopixx methods should be effective on problems involving extracting endmembers from hyperspectral images. Yet, these methods are challenging to perform in practice, due to high computational costs. They require us to solve LP problems, called Hottopixx models, whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. It is thus still unclear as to whether they are actually effective or not. This study clarifies this situation. We propose an efficient and effective implementation of Hottopixx. Our implementation follows the framework of column generation, which is known as a classical but powerful means of solving large-scale LPs. We show in experiments that our implementation is applicable to the endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and can provide estimations of endmember signatures with higher accuracy than the existing methods can.</description>

      <title>Federated Transfer Learning with Task Personalization for Condition Monitoring in Ultrasonic Metal Welding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasonic metal welding (UMW) is a key joining technology with widespread industrial applications. Condition monitoring (CM) capabilities are critically needed in UMW applications because process anomalies significantly deteriorate the joining quality. Recently, machine learning models emerged as a promising tool for CM in many manufacturing applications due to their ability to learn complex patterns. Yet, the successful deployment of these models requires substantial training data that may be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Additionally, many existing machine learning models lack generalizability and cannot be directly applied to new process configurations (i.e., domains). Such issues may be potentially alleviated by pooling data across manufacturers, but data sharing raises critical data privacy concerns. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Federated Transfer Learning with Task Personalization (FTL-TP) framework that provides domain generalization capabilities in distributed learning while ensuring data privacy. By effectively learning a unified representation from feature space, FTL-TP can adapt CM models for clients working on similar tasks, thereby enhancing their overall adaptability and performance jointly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FTL-TP, we investigate two distinct UMW CM tasks, tool condition monitoring and workpiece surface condition classification. Compared with state-of-the-art FL algorithms, FTL-TP achieves a 5.35%--8.08% improvement of accuracy in CM in new target domains. FTL-TP is also shown to perform excellently in challenging scenarios involving unbalanced data distributions and limited client fractions. Furthermore, by implementing the FTL-TP method on an edge-cloud architecture, we show that this method is both viable and efficient in practice. The FTL-TP framework is readily extensible to various other manufacturing applications.</description>

Abstract: Semantic communication is of crucial importance for the next-generation wireless communication networks. The existing works have developed semantic communication frameworks based on deep learning. However, systems powered by deep learning are vulnerable to threats such as backdoor attacks and adversarial attacks. This paper delves into backdoor attacks targeting deep learning-enabled semantic communication systems. Since current works on backdoor attacks are not tailored for semantic communication scenarios, a new backdoor attack paradigm on semantic symbols (BASS) is introduced, based on which the corresponding defense measures are designed. Specifically, a training framework is proposed to prevent BASS. Additionally, reverse engineering-based and pruning-based defense strategies are designed to protect against backdoor attacks in semantic communication. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed attack paradigm and the defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communications Using Uplink-Downlink Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel optimization framework for beamforming design in integrated sensing and communication systems where a base station seeks to minimize the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound of a sensing problem while satisfying quality of service constraints for the communication users. Prior approaches formulate the design problem as a semidefinite program for which acquiring a beamforming solution is computationally expensive. In this work, we show that the computational burden can be considerably alleviated. To achieve this, we transform the design problem to a tractable form that not only provides a new understanding of Cram\'er-Rao bound optimization, but also allows for an uplink-downlink duality relation to be developed. Such a duality result gives rise to an efficient algorithm that enables the beamforming design problem to be solved at a much lower complexity as compared to the-state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of RIS-Assisted Spectrum Sharing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted underlay spectrum sharing system, in which a RIS-assisted secondary network shares the spectrum licensed for a primary network. The secondary network consists of a secondary source (SS), an RIS, and a secondary destination (SD), operating in a Rician fading environment. We study the performance of the secondary network while considering a peak power constraint at the SS and an interference power constraint at the primary receiver (PR). Initially, we characterize the statistics of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the RIS-assisted secondary network by deriving novel analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) in terms of the incomplete H-function. Building upon the SNR statistics, we analyze the outage probability, ergodic capacity, and average bit error rate, subsequently deriving novel exact expressions for these performance measures. Furthermore, we obtain novel asymptotic expressions for the performance measures of interest when the peak power of the SS is high. Finally, we conduct exhaustive Monte-Carlo simulations to confirm the correctness of our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Reflective Beamforming for Multi-Active-IRS-Assisted Cooperative Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies multi-active intelligent-reflecting-surface (IRS) cooperative sensing, in which multiple active IRSs are deployed in a distributed manner to help the base station (BS) provide multi-view sensing. We focus on the scenario where the sensing target is located in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the BS. Based on the received echo signal, the BS aims to estimate the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to each IRS. In addition, we leverage active IRSs to overcome the severe path loss induced by multi-hop reflections. Under this setup, we minimize the maximum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) among all IRSs by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the multiple IRSs, subject to the constraints on the maximum transmit power at the BS, as well as the maximum transmit power and the maximum power amplification gain at individual IRSs. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex max-CRB minimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and semi-definite relaxation, to obtain a high-quality solution. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed design and the benefits of active IRS-assisted sensing compared to the counterpart with passive IRSs.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Communication and Computing Scheme for Wi-Fi Networks based on Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The continuous evolution of future mobile communication systems is heading towards the integration of communication and computing, with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) emerging as a crucial means of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) computation. MEC could enhance the computational performance of wireless edge networks by offloading computing-intensive tasks to MEC servers. However, in edge computing scenarios, the sparse sample problem may lead to high costs of time-consuming model training. This paper proposes an MEC offloading decision and resource allocation solution that combines generative AI and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the communication-computing integration scenario in the 802.11ax Wi-Fi network. Initially, the optimal offloading policy is determined by the joint use of the Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) and the Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) algorithm. Subsequently, resource allocation is accomplished by using the Hungarian algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the introduction of Generative AI significantly reduces model training costs, and the proposed solution exhibits significant reductions in system task processing latency and total energy consumption costs.</description>

      <title>Beyond MMSE: Rank-1 Subspace Channel Estimator for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To glean the benefits offered by massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, channel state information must be accurately acquired. Despite the high accuracy, the computational complexity of classical linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator becomes prohibitively high in the context of massive MIMO, while the other low-complexity methods degrade the estimation accuracy seriously. In this paper, we develop a novel rank-1 subspace channel estimator to approximate the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, which outperforms the linear MMSE estimator, but incurs a surprisingly low computational complexity. Our method first acquires the highly accurate angle-of-arrival (AoA) information via a constructed space-embedding matrix and the rank-1 subspace method. Then, it adopts the post-reception beamforming to acquire the unbiased estimate of channel gains. Furthermore, a fast method is designed to implement our new estimator. Theoretical analysis shows that the extra gain achieved by our method over the linear MMSE estimator grows according to the rule of O($\log_{10}M$), while its computational complexity is linearly scalable to the number of antennas $M$. Numerical simulations also validate the theoretical results. Our new method substantially extends the accuracy-complexity region and constitutes a promising channel estimation solution to the emerging massive MIMO communications.</description>

Abstract: This letter considers an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user uplink massive multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The letter derives the closedform approximate expression for the sum achievable rate (AR), where the maximum ratio combination (MRC) processing and low-resolution ADCs are applied at the base station.

      <title>A Multimodal Feature Distillation with CNN-Transformer Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Incomplete Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing brain tumor segmentation methods usually utilize multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities in brain tumor images for segmentation, which can achieve better segmentation performance. However, in clinical applications, some modalities are missing due to resource constraints, leading to severe degradation in the performance of methods applying complete modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal feature distillation with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Transformer hybrid network (MCTSeg) for accurate brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. We first design a Multimodal Feature Distillation (MFD) module to distill feature-level multimodal knowledge into different unimodality to extract complete modality information. We further develop a Unimodal Feature Enhancement (UFE) module to model the relationship between global and local information semantically. Finally, we build a Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module to explicitly align the global correlations among different modalities even when some modalities are missing. Complementary features within and across different modalities are refined via the CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures in both the UFE and CMF modules, where local and global dependencies are both captured. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of the proposed modules with CNN-Transformer networks and the convolutional blocks in Transformer for improving the performance of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2018 and BraTS2020 datasets show that the proposed MCTSeg framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in missing modalities cases.

      <title>Optimal Structure of Receive Beamforming for Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fast data aggregation via over-the-air computation (AirComp) over wireless networks. In this scenario, an access point (AP) with multiple antennas aims to recover the arithmetic mean of sensory data from multiple wireless devices. To minimize estimation distortion, we formulate a mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization problem that considers joint optimization of transmit scalars at wireless devices, denoising factor, and receive beamforming vector at the AP. We derive closed-form expressions for the transmit scalars and denoising factor, resulting in a non-convex quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem concerning the receive beamforming vector. To tackle the computational complexity of the beamforming design, particularly relevant in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp systems, we explore the optimal structure of receive beamforming using successive convex approximation (SCA) and Lagrange duality. By leveraging the proposed optimal beamforming structure, we develop two efficient algorithms based on SCA and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). These algorithms enable fast wireless aggregation with low computational complexity and yield almost identical mean square error (MSE) performance compared to baseline algorithms. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning-based Joint Precoding and Phase Shift Optimization for RIS-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technique for achieving high spectral efficiency (SE) using multiple distributed access points (APs). However, harsh propagation environments often lead to significant communication performance degradation due to high penetration loss. To overcome this issue, we introduce the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the CF mMIMO system as a low-cost and power-efficient solution. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the joint precoding design of the RIS-aided CF mMIMO system to maximize the sum SE. This involves optimizing the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. To tackle this problem, we propose a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that incorporates fuzzy logic (FL). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on alternating optimization techniques, our FL-based MARL algorithm only requires local channel state information, which reduces the need for high backhaul capacity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed FL-MARL algorithm effectively reduces computational complexity while achieving similar performance as conventional MARL methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose incorporating Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) and Passive Optical Network (PON) technologies into next generation spine-and-leaf Data Centre Networks (DCNs). In this work, OWC systems are used to connect the Data Centre (DC) racks through Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) Infrared (IR) transceivers. The transceivers are placed on top of the racks and at distributed Access Points (APs) in the ceiling. Each transceiver on a rack is connected to a leaf switch that connects the servers within the rack. We replace the spine switches by Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and Network Interface Cards (NIC) in the APs to achieve the desired connectivity. We benchmark the power consumption of the proposed OWC-PON-based spine-and-leaf DC against traditional spine-and-leaf DC and report 46% reduction in the power consumption when considering eight racks.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of Transformers for ECG data is not yet realized, despite their widespread success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present a useful masked Transformer method for ECG classification referred to as MTECG, which expands the application of masked autoencoders to ECG time series. We construct a dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of diagnoses annoated by medical experts to explore the properties of MTECG. Under the proposed training strategies, a lightweight model with 5.7M parameters performs stably well on a broad range of masking ratios (5%-75%). The ablation studies highlight the importance of fluctuated reconstruction targets, training schedule length, layer-wise LR decay and DropPath rate. The experiments on both private and public ECG datasets demonstrate that MTECG-T significantly outperforms the recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification.</description>

      <title>Using explainable AI to investigate electrocardiogram changes during healthy aging -- from expert features to raw signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading global cause of mortality. Age is an important covariate whose effect is most easily investigated in a healthy cohort to properly distinguish the former from disease-related changes. Traditionally, most of such insights have been drawn from the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) feature changes in individuals as they age. However, these features, while informative, may potentially obscure underlying data relationships. In this paper we present the following contributions: (1) We employ a deep-learning model and a tree-based model to analyze ECG data from a robust dataset of healthy individuals across varying ages in both raw signals and ECG feature format. (2) We use explainable AI methods to identify the most discriminative ECG features across age groups.(3) Our analysis with tree-based classifiers reveals age-related declines in inferred breathing rates and identifies notably high SDANN values as indicative of elderly individuals, distinguishing them from younger adults. (4) Furthermore, the deep-learning model underscores the pivotal role of the P-wave in age predictions across all age groups, suggesting potential changes in the distribution of different P-wave types with age. These findings shed new light on age-related ECG changes, offering insights that transcend traditional feature-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Joint User Scheduling, Power Allocation, and Rate Control for MC-RSMA in URLLC Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource management problem in multi-carrier rate-splitting multiple access (MC-RSMA) systems with imperfect channel state information (CSI) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) applications. To explore the trade-off between the decoding error probability and achievable rate, effective throughput (ET) is adopted as the utility function in this study. Then, a mixed-integer non-convex problem is formulated, where power allocation, rate control, and user grouping are jointly taken into consideration. To tackle this problem, we approximate the achievable ET using a lower bound and then develop a decomposition method to decouple optimization variables. Specifically, for a given user grouping scheme, an iteration-based concave-convex programming (CCCP) method and an iteration-free lower-bound approximation (LBA) method are proposed for power allocation and rate control. Next, a greedy search-based scheme and a heuristic grouping scheme are developed for the user-grouping problem. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the CCCP and LBA methods in power allocation and rate control and the greedy search-based and heuristic grouping methods in user grouping. Besides, the superiority of RSMA for URLLC services is demonstrated when compared to spatial division multiple access.</description>

Abstract: We investigate federated learning (FL) in the presence of stragglers, with emphasis on wireless scenarios where the power-constrained edge devices collaboratively train a global model on their local datasets and transmit local model updates through fading channels. To tackle stragglers resulting from link disruptions without requiring accurate prior information on connectivity or dataset sharing, we propose a gradient coding (GC) scheme based on cooperative communication, which remains valid for general collaborative federated learning. Furthermore, we conduct an outage analysis of the proposed scheme, based on which we conduct the convergence analysis. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed strategy in the presence of stragglers, especially under imbalanced data distribution.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents design techniques for an energy-efficient multi-lane receiver (RX) with baud-rate clock and data recovery (CDR), which is essential for high-throughput low-latency communication in high-performance computing systems. The proposed low-power global clock distribution not only significantly reduces power consumption across multi-lane RXs but is capable of compensating for the frequency offset without any phase interpolators. To this end, a fractional divider controlled by CDR is placed close to the global phase locked loop. Moreover, in order to address the sub-optimal lock point of conventional baud-rate phase detectors, the proposed CDR employs a background eye-climbing algorithm, which optimizes the sampling phase and maximizes the vertical eye margin (VEM). Fabricated in a 28nm CMOS process, the proposed 4x32Gb/s RX shows a low integrated fractional spur of -40.4dBc at a 2500ppm frequency offset. Furthermore, it improves bit-error-rate performance by increasing the VEM by 17%. The entire RX achieves the energy efficiency of 1.8pJ/bit with the aggregate data rate of 128Gb/s.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Enabled Anti-Detection for Secure Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08366</link>

Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance on wireless communication and sensing has led to growing concerns over the vulnerability of sensitive information to unauthorized detection and interception. Traditional anti-detection methods are often inadequate, suffering from limited adaptability and diminished effectiveness against advanced detection technologies. To overcome these challenges, this article presents the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) as a groundbreaking technology for enabling flexible electromagnetic manipulation, which has the potential to revolutionize anti-detection in both electromagnetic stealth/spoofing (evading radar detection) and covert communications (facilitating secure information exchange). We explore the fundamental principles of IRS and its advantages over traditional anti-detection techniques and discuss various design challenges associated with implementing IRS-based anti-detection systems. Through the examination of case studies and future research directions, we provide a comprehensive overview of the potential of IRS technology to serve as a formidable shield in the modern wireless landscape.</description>

      <title>Zero-Energy Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (zeRIS)</title>

Abstract: A primary objective of the forthcoming sixth generation (6G) of wireless networking is to support demanding applications, while ensuring energy efficiency. Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to control wireless propagation and deliver exceptional quality-ofservice. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a network supported by zero-energy RISs (zeRISs), which harvest energy for their operation and contribute to the realization of PWEs. Specifically, we investigate joint energy-data rate outage probability and the energy efficiency of a zeRIS-assisted communication system by employing three harvest-and-reflect (HaR) methods, i) power splitting, ii) time switching, and iii) element splitting. Furthermore, we consider two zeRIS deployment strategies, namely BS-side zeRIS and UE-side zeRIS. Simulation results validate the provided analysis and examine which HaR method performs better depending on the zeRIS placement. Finally, valuable insights and conclusions for the performance of zeRISassisted wireless networks are drawn from the presented results.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of OTSM under Hardware Impairments and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal time sequency multiplexing (OTSM) has been recently proposed as a single-carrier waveform offering similar bit error rate to orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in doubly-spread channels (DSCs); however, with a much lower complexity making it a potential candidate for 6G wireless networks. In this paper, the performance of OTSM is explored by considering the joint effects of multiple hardware impairments (HWIs) such as in-phase and quadrature imbalance (IQI), direct current offset (DCO), phase noise, power amplifier non-linearity, carrier frequency offset, and synchronization timing offset for the first time in the area. First, the discrete-time baseband signal model is obtained in vector form under all mentioned HWIs. Second, the system input-output relations are derived in time, delay-time, and delay-sequency (DS) domains in which the parameters of all mentioned HWIs are incorporated. Third, analytical expressions are derived for the pairwise and average bit error probability under imperfect channel state information (CSI) as a function of the parameters of all mentioned HWIs. Analytical results demonstrate that under all mentioned HWIs, noise stays additive white Gaussian, effective channel matrix is sparse, DCO appears as a DC signal at the receiver interfering with only the zero sequency, and IQI redounds to self-conjugated sequency interference in the DS domain. Simulation results reveal the fact that by considering the joint effects of all mentioned HWIs and imperfect CSI not only OTSM outperforms OFDM by 29% in terms of energy of bit per noise but it performs same as OTFS in high mobility DSCs.</description>
