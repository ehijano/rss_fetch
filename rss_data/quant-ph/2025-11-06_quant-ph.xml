      <title>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Zero-Noise Extrapolation via Cyclic Permutations of Quantum Circuit Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation (CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$ different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer, the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude, depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$ relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.</description>

      <title>Classical shadows for sample-efficient measurements of gauge-invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Analytically Continuing the Randomized Measurement Toolbox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\'eel state from R\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental R\'enyi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and R\'enyi relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Correlation Self-Testing of Quantum Theory against Generalised Probabilistic Theories with Restricted Relabelling Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid, there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional consistency and Tsirelson's bound.</description>

      <title>Motional entanglement in low-energy collisions near shape resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen discussed their paradox in terms of measuring the positions or momenta of two particles. These can become entangled upon scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section, including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum collisions.</description>

      <title>SWAP-Network Routing and Spectral Qubit Ordering for MPS Imaginary-Time Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired combinatorial solver that performs imaginary-time evolution (ITE) on a matrix product state (MPS), incorporating non-local couplings through structured SWAP networks and spectral qubit mapping of logical qubits. The SWAP networks, composed exclusively of local two-qubit gates, effectively mediate non-local qubit interactions. We investigate two distinct network architectures based on rectangular and triangular meshes of SWAP gates and analyze their performance in combination with spectral qubit ordering, which maps logical qubits to MPS sites based on the Laplacian of the logical qubit connectivity graph. The proposed framework is evaluated on synthetic MaxCut instances with varying graph connectivity, as well as on a dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on real historical asset data involving 180 qubits. On certain problem configurations, we observe an over 20$\times$ reduction in error when combining spectral ordering and triangular SWAP networks compared to optimization with shuffled qubit ordering. Furthermore, an analysis of the entanglement entropy during portfolio optimization reveals that spectral qubit ordering not only improves solution quality but also enhances the total and spatially distributed entanglement within the MPS. These findings demonstrate that exploiting problem structure through spectral mapping and efficient routing networks can substantially enhance the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>D2-UC: A Distributed-Distributed Quantum-Classical Framework for Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces D2-UC, a quantum-ready framework for the unit commitment (UC) problem that prepares UC for near-term hybrid quantum-classical solvers by combining distributed classical decomposition with distributed quantum execution. We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold. First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and near-term quantum hardware capabilities. All detailed data, codes, and parameter values are available at https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/3B-ADMM-UC-DVQE .</description>

      <title>Frequency- and Amplitude-Modulated Gates for Universal Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits, converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.</description>

      <title>Heralded Induced-Coherence Interferometry in a Noisy Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induced-coherence interferometry, first introduced in the Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) setup, enables retrieval of object information from the interference pattern of light that never interacted with the object. This scheme relies on two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of "which-way" information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes, revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing heralded detection removes the detrimental effect of thermal background noise, restoring high-contrast interference fringes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing of Copper-Phthalocyanine Electron Spins via NV Relaxometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely squeezed states, which can be regarded as Schrodinger cat states. Compared with conventional coherent-state cat states, these states exhibit distinct photon-number structures and enhanced nonclassical features. We analyze their Wigner function and quantify the entanglement generated when they are injected into a 50:50 beam splitter. For small squeezing parameters, the resulting two-mode states possess higher entanglement than pure two-mode squeezed vacuum states. We also propose a linear-optical heralding scheme that approximates this superposition of oppositely squeezed states without requiring strong Kerr nonlinearities. Our results indicate that such states are promising resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly in regimes where high non-Gaussianity and strong entanglement are desirable.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model induced by parametric amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit using the pattern picture. By expanding the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian in operator space, we obtained three patterns, and we find that the phase transition arises from the competition between patterns. The difficulty in achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model. This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame. According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical point. The photon number becomes infinite beyond the critical point. These results indicate that the system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical hybrid algorithm using quantum annealing for multi-objective job shop scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient production planning is essential in modern manufacturing to improve performance indicators such as lead time and to reduce reliance on human intuition. While mathematical optimization approaches, formulated as job shop scheduling problems, have been applied to automate this process, solving large-scale production planning problems remains computationally demanding. Moreover, many practical scenarios involve conflicting objectives, making traditional scalarization techniques ineffective in finding diverse and useful Pareto-optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we developed a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that decomposes the problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and task scheduling. Resource allocation is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved using annealing-based methods that efficiently explore complex solutions. Task scheduling is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved using conventional solvers to satisfy detailed scheduling constraints. We validated the proposed method using benchmark instances based on foundry production scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves superior solution quality and computational efficiency compared to traditional monolithic methods. This work offers a promising direction for high-speed, multi-objective scheduling in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Probes of Multipartite Entanglement in Strongly Interacting Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems and hybrid quantum computing architectures is a fundamental yet challenging task. In recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions, including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model, and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Influence of Data Dimensionality Reduction Methods on the Effectiveness of Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data dimensionality reduction techniques are often utilized in the implementation of Quantum Machine Learning models to address two significant issues: the constraints of NISQ quantum devices, which are characterized by noise and a limited number of qubits, and the challenge of simulating a large number of qubits on classical devices. It also raises concerns over the scalability of these approaches, as dimensionality reduction methods are slow to adapt to large datasets. In this article, we analyze how data reduction methods affect different QML models. We conduct this experiment over several generated datasets, quantum machine algorithms, quantum data encoding methods, and data reduction methods. All these models were evaluated on the performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings have led us to conclude that the usage of data dimensionality reduction methods results in skewed performance metric values, which results in wrongly estimating the actual performance of quantum machine learning models. There are several factors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this problem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum information embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical components associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine learning models. We consistently observed the difference in the accuracy range of 14% to 48% amongst these models, using data reduction and not using it. Apart from this, our observations have shown that some data reduction methods tend to perform better for some specific data embedding methodologies and ansatz constructions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topologies in Quantum Annealing: A Hardware-Aware Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) offers a promising framework for solving NP-hard optimization problems, but its effectiveness is constrained by the topology of the underlying quantum hardware. Solving an optimization problem $P$ via QA involves a hardware-aware circuit compilation which requires representing $P$ as a graph $G_P$ and embedding it into the hardware connectivity graph $G_Q$ that defines how qubits connect to each other in a QA-based quantum processing unit (QPU).
  Minor Embedding (ME) is a possible operational form of this hardware-aware compilation. ME heuristically builds a map that associates each node of $G_P$ -- the logical variables of $P$ -- to a chain of adjacent nodes in $G_Q$ by means of one of its minors, so that the arcs of $G_P$ are preserved as physical connections among qubits in $G_Q$.
  The static topology of hardwired qubits can clearly lead to inefficient compilations because $G_Q$ cannot be a clique, currently. We propose a methodology and a set of criteria to evaluate how the hardware topology $G_Q$ can negatively affect the embedded problem, thus making the quantum optimization more sensible to noise.
  We evaluate the result of ME across two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs (used in current D-Wave systems) and Havel-Hakimi graphs, which allow controlled variation of the average node degree. This enables us to study how the ratio `number of nodes/number of incident arcs per node' affects ME success rates to map $G_P$ into a minor of $G_Q$.
  Our findings, obtained through ME executed on classical, i.e. non-quantum, architectures, suggest that Havel-Hakimi-based topologies, on average, require shorter qubit chains in the minor of $G_P$, exhibiting smoother scaling of the largest embeddable $G_P$ as the QPU size increases. These characteristics indicate their potential as alternative designs for QA-based QPUs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical discontinuities in repeated weak measurements revealed by complex weak values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical phenomena reveal universal behavior in complex systems, and uncovering analogous effects in quantum weak measurement protocols with post-selection provides new insight into how measurement backaction can shape quantum dynamics. This work investigates dynamical discontinuities that arise when the post-selected polar angle is used as a control parameter. The system evolves under repeated applications of a weak measurement protocol with post-selection, in which the meter state is retained after each iteration while the system is renewed. The emergence of these discontinuities is shown to be determined by the structure of the weak value: when the weak value has a nonzero imaginary component, a discontinuity appears in the expectation value of meter observables precisely at the point where the imaginary part of the weak value vanishes as a function of the post-selection polar angle. In contrast, no discontinuities occur when the weak value remains real for all post-selection angles. The phenomenon originates from the eigenstructure of the protocol's Kraus operator, with the stability of fixed points changing at the critical point where the discontinuity arises. Remarkably, the associated critical exponent is 1, independent of system parameters. These results open new perspectives for engineering non-analytic behavior in measurement-based quantum control and for probing criticality in post-selected quantum dynamics using weak measurements with weak values.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Simulation of 50 Qubits on Europe`s First Exascale Supercomputer Harnessing Its Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new version of the high-performance J\"ulich universal quantum computer simulator (JUQCS-50) that leverages key features of the GH200 superchips as used in the JUPITER supercomputer, enabling simulations of a 50-qubit universal quantum computer for the first time. JUQCS-50 achieves this through three key innovations: (1) extending usable memory beyond GPU limits via high-bandwidth CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory; (2) adaptive data encoding to reduce memory footprint with acceptable trade-offs in precision and compute effort; and (3) an on-the-fly network traffic optimizer. These advances result in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K computer.</description>

      <title>Integration of quantum dots at the tips of single plasmonic bipyramid nanoantennas for strong coupling at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving strong coupling between excitons of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPs) is critical for advanced room-temperature quantum emitter and sensing applications. A key challenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to an individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong coupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of the bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a very small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved via plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the enhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a photosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra of a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength of 175.68 meV. The with distinct anti-crossing behavior is confirmed by simulations. This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling systems compared to previous methods. These results indicate a scalable platform for solid-state quantum technologies with colloidal QDs, enabling explora-tion of exciton-plasmon interactions and further advance-ment of applications in quantum optics and quantum sensing under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-elevated Chiral Discrimination for Bio-molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity, quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research, environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.</description>

      <title>Universal first-passage time statistics for quantum diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-passage phenomena play a fundamental role in classical stochastic processes. We here exactly solve a quantum first-passage time problem for quantum diffusion driven by measurement noise, a generalization of classical Brownian motion. Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>The Converse Madelung Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pose the converse Madelung question: not whether Fisher information can reproduce quantum mechanics, but whether it is necessary. We work with minimal, physically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability conservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility, and convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local Hamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson bracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for local hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change of variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show that the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional of the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is exactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient equals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce to the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local complex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species, fixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the Bargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences. Comparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero diffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational falsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi equations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant under Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a reversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics. A code archive enables direct numerical checks, including a superposition stress test that preserves exact projective linearity within our axioms.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation using energy sampling and extrapolation enhanced Clifford data regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open and Dissipative Systems: An Efficient Memory-Kernel Approach Linked to Dyadic Greens Function and CEM Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics, thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is rapidly becoming the focus of modern attosecond science. Here, we demonstrate numerically how such states can arise by considering a modification of the well-known problem of superradiance encountered already by Dicke. Similarly to him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian, non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.</description>

      <title>Directional quantum walks of two bosons on the Hatano-Nelson lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the interplay of interactions and non-Hermiticity in the dynamics of two bosons on the one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice with non-reciprocal tunneling. We find that the non-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric density cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry can be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity parameter, $\delta$. Next, we analyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force and demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch oscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \ne 0$), strong interactions leads to the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this inner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We further analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits non-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong) interactions. Finally, we examine the growth of the Quantum Fisher Information, $F_Q$, with time, and demonstrate that $F_Q \propto t^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha \sim 3$. This feature persists for both one- and two-particle walks, thereby demonstrating that this system can be employed as a quantum-enhanced sensor for detecting weak forces.</description>

      <title>Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Powered Work: Equivalence in Peak Yield, Differences in Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initial system-environment correlations are a thermodynamic resource, enabling work extraction via their erasure. We compare the work potential of classical, quantum, and hypothetical stronger-than-quantum correlations as a function of measurement misalignment. While all models can yield a peak extractable work of k_B T ln 2, corresponding to a mutual information of ln 2, their value as a resource differs critically in its robustness. The classical resource is fragile, decaying linearly with misalignment, whereas the quantum resource is robust, decaying only quadratically. Thus, the degree of nonlocality maps not to the maximum energetic value of a correlation, but to its operational robustness as a thermodynamic fuel.</description>

      <title>Certified randomness amplification by dynamically probing remote random quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptography depends on truly unpredictable numbers, but physical sources emit biased or correlated bits. Quantum mechanics enables the amplification of imperfect randomness into nearly perfect randomness, but prior demonstrations have required physically co-located, loophole-free Bell tests, constraining the feasibility of remote operation. Here we realize certified randomness amplification across a network by dynamically probing large, entangled quantum states on Quantinuum's 98-qubit Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Our protocol is secure even if the remote device acts maliciously or is compromised by an intercepting adversary, provided the samples are generated quickly enough to preclude classical simulation of the quantum circuits. We stream quantum gates in real time to the quantum processor, maintain quantum state coherence for $\approx 0.9$ seconds, and then reveal the measurement bases to the quantum processor only milliseconds before measurement. This limits the time for classical spoofing to 30 ms and constrains the location of hypothetical adversaries to a $4{,}500$ km radius. We achieve a fidelity of 0.586 on random circuits with 64 qubits and 276 two-qubit gates, enabling the amplification of realistic imperfect randomness with a low entropy rate into nearly perfect randomness.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifts as a reflection of ground state squeezing and entanglement in two coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the quantum-to-classical boundary.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Quantum Streaming Algorithm on Long-lived Trapped-ion Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large classical datasets are often processed in the streaming model, with data arriving one item at a time. In this model, quantum algorithms have been shown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However, experimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that remain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work, we realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external server. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying many quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a problem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space. Furthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>A Transferable Machine Learning Approach to Predict Quantum Circuit Parameters for Electronic Structure Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The individual optimization of quantum circuit parameters is currently one of the main practical bottlenecks in variational quantum eigensolvers for electronic systems. To this end, several machine learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the problem. However, such method predominantly aims at training and predicting parameters tailored to individual molecules: either a specific structure, or several structures of the same molecule with varying bond lengths. This work explores machine learning based modeling strategies to include transferability between different molecules. We use a well investigated quantum circuit design and apply it to model properties of hydrogenic systems where we show parameter prediction that is systematically transferable to instances significantly larger than the training instances.</description>

      <title>Universal breathing mode scaling in harmonically trapped Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive universal, experiment ready analytic laws for the breathing (monopole) mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases. Within a fixed hyperangular channel $s&gt;0$, contact-weighted products of associated Laguerre polynomials reduce to an elementary gamma ratio, yielding: (i) a level resolved fractional breathing mode shift with scaling $\delta\omega/(2\omega)\propto Q^{-1}$, where $Q\equiv 2q+s+1$, with $q$ the radial quantum number; (ii) a first order quantum anomaly correction involving exactly two intermediate states, producing a $Q^{-2}$ falloff of the leaked monopole strength with an explicit prefactor; and (iii) a closed form finite temperature average exhibiting a low-$T$ plateau and a $1/T$ high-$T$ tail. We also obtain a mixed anomaly\nobreakdash-quartic correction for weak anharmonicity. All expressions become parameter free after a single per-channel calibration of the Tan contact $\lambda_s$ at $q=0$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning (ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10 dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Nishimori multicriticality through the lens of information measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum error correction threshold is closely related to the Nishimori physics of random statistical models. We extend quantum information measures such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove global existence and uniqueness of Heisenberg dynamics on the quasi-local algebra of an extended quantum lattice system for spatially growing generators. Existing results assume that the local terms of the generator decay fast enough and are bounded uniformly in space and time. We show, in analogy to global existence results for first order ODEs, that global existence and uniqueness still hold true if the local terms grow at most linearly in space. Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for the generated dynamics.
  For the proof, we mainly assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics generated by uniformly bounded local terms. These are known to hold for example if the local terms are exponentially localized.</description>

      <title>Improving the Energy and Angular Resolutions of X-ray Telescopes with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a 12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of ~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.</description>

      <title>Exploring the mechanisms of transverse relaxation of copper(II)-phthalocyanine spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms. The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to $T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times. These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits for scalable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bistability and Exact Reflectionless States in Nonlinear Scattering of a Bose--Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mean-field scattering dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate interacting with a Rosen--Morse potential. For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.</description>

      <title>Isolated quantum-state networks in ultracold molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</description>

      <title>Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the integrability of a family of SYK models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Inertial Repulsion from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a repulsive, charge-dipole-like interaction for a Dirac particle in a rotating frame, arising from a geometric $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated with the Berry phase. The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\vert r\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in the magnon spectrum of 2D altermagnets via continuous similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum effects on magnon excitations in a minimal spin-1/2 Heisenberg model for 2D altermagnets on the square lattice. A continuous similarity transformation is applied in momentum space to derive an effective Hamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations. This allows us to quantitatively calculate the one-magnon dispersion, the effects of magnon-magnon interactions, and the dynamic structure factor in a certain range of parameters. In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of generators, which signal either the breakdown of the N\'eel-ordered phase or the presence of significant magnon decay.</description>

      <title>Encoding electronic ground-state information with variational even-tempered basis sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a system-oriented basis-set design based on even-tempered basis functions to variationally encode electronic ground-state information into molecular orbitals. First, we introduce a reduced formalism of concentric even-tempered orbitals that achieves hydrogen energy accuracy on par with the conventional formalism, with lower optimization cost and improved scalability. Second, we propose a symmetry-adapted, even-tempered formalism specifically designed for molecular systems. It requires only primitive S-subshell Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations and potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Quantum Coherent Superradiant States in Relation to Exciton-Phonon Interactions and the Fundamental Soliton in Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of macroscopic coherent quantum states at room temperature is crucial in modern quantum technologies. In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.</description>

      <title>Introducing Quantum Computing into Statistical Physics: Random Walks and the Ising Model with Qiskit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a powerful new perspective on probabilistic and collective behaviors traditionally taught in statistical physics. This paper presents two classroom-ready modules that integrate quantum computing into the undergraduate curriculum using Qiskit: the quantum random walk and the Ising model. Both modules allow students to simulate and contrast classical and quantum systems, deepening their understanding of concepts such as superposition, interference, and statistical distributions. We outline the quantum circuits involved, provide sample code and student activities, and discuss how each example can be used to enhance student engagement with statistical physics. These modules are suitable for integration into courses in statistical mechanics, modern physics, or as part of an introductory unit on quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00986v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for super-resolving signals encoded as finite mixtures of bosonic modes using collective measurements that exploit permutation symmetry. Specifically, we use multiple copies of the state $\rho$ of the finite mixture to extract an estimate for the purity of $\rho$ via a spectrum measurement, the weak Schur-sampling measurement. Depending on the outcome we then further fine-grain the measurement to optimally extract an estimate of the relative intensity between the two incoherent mixtures. Our protocol furnishes simultaneous estimates for both the relative intensity and the separation of incoherent signals saturating the multi-parameter Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, and is robust against misalignment errors. We also provide viable experimental avenues for implementing such collective measurements in different set-ups.</description>

      <title>Experimental high-dimensional entanglement certification and quantum steering with time-energy measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement provides unique ways of transcending the limitations of current approaches in quantum information processing, quantum communications based on qubits. The generation of time-frequency qudit states offer significantly increased quantum capacities while keeping the number of photons constant, but pose significant challenges regarding the possible measurements for certification of entanglement. Here, we develop a new scheme and experimentally demonstrate the certification of 24-dimensional entanglement and a 9-dimensional quantum steering. We then subject our photon-pairs to dispersion conditions equivalent to the transmission through 600-km of fiber and still certify 21-dimensional entanglement. Furthermore, we use a steering inequality to prove 7-dimensional entanglement in a semi-device independent manner, proving that large chromatic dispersion is not an obstacle in distributing and certifying high-dimensional entanglement and quantum steering. Our approach, leveraging intrinsic large-alphabet nature of telecom-band photons, enables scalable, commercially viable, and field-deployable entangled and steerable quantum sources, providing a pathway towards fully scalable quantum information processer and high-dimensional quantum communication networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the Fock dimension (Fock number of the highest occupied Fock state of one mode), and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the Fock dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of large-scale quantum computation with an integrated chip of spin qubits is imminent as technology improves. This invites us to think beyond the traditional 2-qubit-gate framework and consider a naturally supported ``instruction set'' of multi-qubit gates. In this work, we systematically study such a family of multi-qubit gates implementable over an array of quantum dots by DC evolution. A useful representation of the computational Hamiltonian is proposed for a dot-array with strong spin-orbit coupling effects, distinctive $g$-factor tensors and varying interdot couplings. Adopting a perturbative treatment, we model a multi-qubit DC gate by the first-order dynamics in the qubit frame and develop a detailed formalism for decomposing the resulting gate, estimating and optimizing the coherent gate errors with appropriate local phase shifts for arbitrary array connectivity. Examples of such multi-qubit gates and their applications in quantum error correction and quantum algorithms are also explored, demonstrating their potential advantage in accelerating complex tasks and reducing overall errors.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid languages like the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) are essential for programming systems that mix quantum and conventional computing models, while execution of these programs is often deferred to a system-specific implementation. Here, we develop the QIR Execution Engine (QIR-EE) for parsing, interpreting, and executing QIR across multiple hardware platforms. QIR-EE uses LLVM to execute hybrid instructions specifying quantum programs and, by design, presents extension points that support customized runtime and hardware environments. We demonstrate an implementation that uses the XACC quantum hardware-accelerator library to dispatch prototypical quantum programs on different commercial quantum platforms and numerical simulators, and we validate execution of QIR-EE on IonQ, Quantinuum, and IBM hardware. Our results highlight the efficiency of hybrid executable architectures for handling mixed instructions, managing mixed data, and integrating with quantum computing frameworks to realize cross-platform execution.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Private Quantum Channels and Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. With the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight, while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.</description>

Abstract: We consider a lattice of $d=6$ qudits that supports $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{S}_3)$ non-Abelian anyons. We present a method for implementing both braiding and fusion evolutions using only the operators that create and measure anyons, without requiring additional dynamical control. This provides a minimal protocol demonstrating that $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{S}_3)$ anyons can generate magic states, thereby establishing their universality for quantum computation. Furthermore, we show that the entire scheme can be encoded in just two qudits, offering a compact blueprint that is inherently scalable and readily implementable in current quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: Finding molecular ground states and energies with variational quantum eigensolvers is central to chemistry applications on quantum computers. Physically motivated ans\"atze based on excitation operators respect physical symmetries, but existing quantum-aware optimizers, such as Rotosolve, have been limited to simpler operator types. To fill this gap, we introduce ExcitationSolve, a fast quantum-aware optimizer that is globally-informed, gradient-free, and hyperparameter-free. ExcitationSolve extends these optimizers to parameterized unitaries with generators $G$ of the form $G^3=G$ exhibited by excitation operators in approaches such as unitary coupled cluster. ExcitationSolve determines the global optimum along each variational parameter using the same quantum resources that gradient-based optimizers require for one update step. We provide optimization strategies for both fixed and adaptive variational ans\"atze, along with generalizations for simultaneously selecting and optimizing multiple excitations. On molecular ground state energy benchmarks, ExcitationSolve outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by converging faster, achieving chemical accuracy for equilibrium geometries in a single parameter sweep, yielding shallower adaptive ans\"atze and remaining robust to real hardware noise. By uniting physical insight with efficient optimization, ExcitationSolve paves the way for scalable quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing thermal states using dimensionally limited probes : A Model for Limited Control &amp; Memory in Quantum Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Whilst the complexity of acquiring knowledge of a quantum state has been extensively studied in the fields of quantum tomography and quantum learning, a physical understanding of its operational role and cost in quantum thermodynamics is lacking. Knowledge is central to thermodynamics, as exemplified by Maxwell's demon thought experiment, where a demonic agent is able to extract paradoxical amounts of work -- reconciled by the thermodynamic costs of acquiring this knowledge. In this work, we address this gap by extending unitary models of measurement to incorporate the resources available to an agent. We view an agent's knowledge of a quantum state as their ability to reconstruct it unitarily given access to states with partial knowledge of the true state. In our model, an agent correlates an unknown $d$-dimensional system, with copies of a $k$-dimensional probe ($k\leq d$), which are then used to unitarily reconstruct an estimate state in $d$-dimensional memories. We find that this framework is a unitary representation of coarse-grained POVMs. As an application, we investigate the role of knowledge in an extended Szilard Engine scenario.</description>

      <title>Storage and retrieval of two unknown unitary channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the fundamental task of converting $n$ uses of an unknown unitary transformation into a quantum state (i.e., storage) and later retrieval of the transformation. Specifically, we consider the case where the unknown unitary is selected with equal prior probability from two options. First, we prove that the optimal storage strategy involves the sequential application of the $n$ uses of the unknown unitary, and it produces the optimal state for discrimination between the two possible unitaries. Next, we show that incoherent "measure-and-prepare" retrieval achieves the maximum fidelity between the retrieved operation and the original (qubit) unitary. We then identify the retrieval strategy that maximizes the probability of successfully and perfectly retrieving the unknown transformation. In the regime in which the fidelity between the two possible unitaries is large the probability of success scales as $ P_{succ} = 1 - \mathcal{O}(n^{-2} ) $, which is a quadratic improvement with respect to the case in which the unitaries are drawn from the entire unitary group $U(d)$ with uniform prior probability. Finally, we present an optical experiment for this approach and assess the storage and retrieval quality using quantum tomography of states and processes. The results are discussed in relation to non-optimal measure-and-prepare strategy, highlighting the advantages of our protocol.</description>

      <title>Credible-interval-based adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation for entanglement-enhanced atomic clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors encounter a fundamental trade-off: while entanglement improves precision to the Heisenberg limit, it restricts dynamic range. To address this trade-off, we present a credible-interval-based adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state-based atomic clocks. Our method optimally integrates prior knowledge with new measurements and determines the interrogation time by correlating it with the period of the likelihood function, based on Bayesian credible intervals. Our protocol can be implemented using either individual or cascaded GHZ states, thereby extending the dynamic range without compromising Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. In parallel with the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol using fixed interrogation times, the dynamic range can be extended through an interferometry sequence that employs individual GHZ states with variable interrogation times. Furthermore, by varying the interrogation times, the dynamic range of the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol can be further extended. Crucially, our protocol enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling $\propto 1/(Nt)$ in both particle number $N$ and total interrogation time $t$, surpassing the hybrid scaling $\propto 1/{(N\sqrt {t}})$ of the conventional cascaded-GHZ-state protocol. While offering a wider dynamic range, the protocol is more stable against noise and more robust to dephasing than existing adaptive schemes. Beyond atomic clocks, our approach establishes a general framework for developing entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors that simultaneously achieve both high precision and broad dynamic range.</description>

Abstract: We construct superposition states of energy eigenstates of the hydrogen molecule using classically emulated digital quantum simulation. We generate the ground state and excited states of the system via the twirling operation method, and construct superposition states of the ground state and an excited state of the system by applying a controlled excitation unitary transformation on the ground state with one ancillary qubit as the control. To verify the correctness of the resulting superposition state, we calculate matrix elements of several physical observables.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics in one dimension on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. However, experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Pure States is as Hard as Mixed States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography, the task of learning an unknown quantum state, is a fundamental problem in quantum information. In standard settings, the complexity of this problem depends significantly on the type of quantum state that one is trying to learn, with pure states being substantially easier to learn than general mixed states. A natural question is whether this separation holds for any quantum state learning setting. In this work, we consider the online learning framework and prove the surprising result that learning pure states in this setting is as hard as learning mixed states. More specifically, we show that both classes share almost the same sequential fat-shattering dimension, leading to identical regret scaling. We also generalize previous results on full quantum state tomography in the online setting to (i) the $\epsilon$-realizable setting and (ii) learning the density matrix only partially, using smoothed analysis.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Ranks, Barnes Wall Lattices and Magic Monotones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2024, Kliuchnikov and Sch\"onnenbeck showed a connection between the Barnes Wall lattices, stabilizer states and Clifford operations. In this work, we study their results and relate them to the problem of lower bounding stabilizer ranks. We show the first quantitative lower bound on stabilizer fidelity as a function of stabilizer ranks, which reproduces the linear-by-log lower bound for $\chi_{\delta}({|{H}\rangle^{ \otimes n}})$, i.e, on the approximate stabilizer rank of $|H\rangle^{\otimes n}$. In fact, we show that the lower bound holds even when the fidelity between the approximation and ${|H\rangle}^{\otimes n}$ is exponentially small, which is currently the best lower bound in this regime.
  Next, we define a new magic monotone for pure states, the Barnes Wall norm, and its corresponding approximate variant. We upper bound these monotones by the $CS$-count of state preparation, and also by the stabilizer ranks. In particular, the upper bound given by the $CS$-count is tight, in the sense that we exhibit states that achieve the bound.
  Apart from these results, we give a Fidelity Amplification algorithm, which provides a trade-off between approximation error and the stabilizer rank. As a corollary, it gives us a way to compose approximate stabilizer decompositions into approximate decompositions of their tensor products.
  Finally, we provide an alternate, elementary proof of the existence and density of product states with maximal stabilizer ranks, which was first proven by Lovitz and Steffan (2022), where they used results from algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays provide a versatile platform to implement coherent quantum annealing as an approach to solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. Here we present and experimentally demonstrate an efficient encoding scheme based on chains of Rydberg-blockaded atoms, which we call quantum wires, to natively embed maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems on a neutral atom architecture. For graphs with quasi-unit-disk connectivity, in which only a few long-range edges are required, our approach requires a significantly lower overhead in the number of ancilla qubits than previous proposals, facilitating the implementation on currently available hardware. To demonstrate the approach, we perform weighted-graph annealing on a programmable atom array using local light shifts to encode problem-specific weights across graphs of varying sizes. This approach successfully identifies the solutions to the original MWIS and QUBO graph instances. Our work expands the operational toolkit of near-term neutral atom arrays, enhancing their potential for scalable quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies Imply Intrinsic Long-Range Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.</description>

      <title>Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collision models (CMs) describe an open system interacting in sequence with elements of an environment, termed ancillas. They have been established as a useful tool for analyzing non-Markovian open quantum dynamics based on the ability to control the environmental memory through simple feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla entanglement can serve as a mechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on an operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new quantum algorithms for estimating homological invariants, specifically Betti and persistent Betti numbers, of a simplicial complex given through structured classical data. Our approach efficiently constructs block-encodings of (persistent) Laplacians, enabling estimation via stochastic rank methods with complexity polylogarithmic in the number of simplices across both sparse and dense regimes.
  Unlike prior spectral algorithms that suffer when Betti numbers are small, we introduce homology tracking and property testing techniques achieving exponential speedups under natural sparsity and structure assumptions. We also formulate homology triviality and equivalence testing as property testing problems, giving nearly linear-time quantum algorithms when the boundary rank is large. A cohomological formulation further yields rank-independent testing and polylog-time manipulation of $r$-cocycles via block-encoded projections. These results open a new direction in quantum topological data analysis and demonstrate provable quantum advantages in computing topological invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a promising framework for online quantum-enhanced machine learning tailored to temporal tasks, yet practical implementations with native memory capabilities remain limited. Here, we demonstrate an optical QRC platform based on deterministically generated multimode squeezed states, exploiting both spectral and temporal multiplexing in a fully continuous-variable (CV) setting, and enabling controlled fading memory. Data is encoded via programmable phase shaping of the pump in an optical parametric process and retrieved through mode-selective homodyne detection. Real-time memory is achieved through feedback using electro-optic phase modulation, while long-term dependencies are achieved via spatial multiplexing. This architecture with minimal post-processing performs nonlinear temporal tasks, including parity checking and chaotic signal forecasting, with results corroborated by a high-fidelity Digital Twin. We show that leveraging the entangled multimode structure significantly enhances the expressivity and memory capacity of the quantum reservoir. This work establishes a scalable photonic platform for quantum machine learning, operating in CV encoding and supporting practical quantum-enhanced information processing.</description>

      <title>Learning-Optimized Qubit Mapping and Reuse to Minimize Inter-Core Communication in Modular Quantum Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular quantum architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling quantum computing systems by connecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). However, this approach introduces significant challenges due to costly inter-core operations between chips and quantum state transfers, which contribute to noise and quantum decoherence. This paper presents QARMA, a novel Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to 100% (on average 86%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach achieves 97-100% reduction in inter-core operation. The proposed methods advance quantum circuit compilation techniques and enable the execution of more extensive quantum algorithms on resource-constrained modular quantum systems, contributing to the growing body of research on scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>VQC-MLPNet: An Unconventional Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture for Scalable and Robust Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) hold promise for quantum machine learning but face challenges in expressivity, trainability, and noise resilience. We propose VQC-MLPNet, a hybrid architecture where a VQC generates the first-layer weights of a classical multilayer perceptron during training, while inference is performed entirely classically. This design preserves scalability, reduces quantum resource demands, and enables practical deployment. We provide a theoretical analysis based on statistical learning and neural tangent kernel theory, establishing explicit risk bounds and demonstrating improved expressivity and trainability compared to purely quantum or existing hybrid approaches. These theoretical insights demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum architectures. Empirical results on diverse datasets, including quantum-dot classification and genomic sequence analysis, show that VQC-MLPNet achieves high accuracy and robustness under realistic noise models, outperforming classical and quantum baselines while using significantly fewer trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor Improvements in Quantum Algorithms for Linear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for \textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these findings provide a 100-200x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</description>

      <title>Neural Importance Resampling: A Practical Sampling Strategy for Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising and $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg models show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with state of the art methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to the presence of barren plateaus and its sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) has become an attractive area for the application of quantum computing. Recent advances have uncovered many interesting connections between the two fields. On one hand, complexity theoretic results show that estimating Betti numbers, a central task in TDA, is NP hard, indicating that a generic quantum speedup is unlikely. On the other hand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings and demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups under certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti numbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity and holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of topological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of homology that can reveal richer structural information. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for torsion detection, that is, determining whether a given simplicial complex contains torsion. Our algorithm, assisted by a low complexity classical procedure, can succeed with high probability and potentially offer exponential speedup over the classical counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has made remarkable strides in recent years, as demonstrated by quantum supremacy experiments and the realization of high-fidelity, fault-tolerant gates. However, a major obstacle persists: practical real-world applications remain scarce, largely due to the inefficiency of loading classical data into quantum processors. Here, we propose an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from classical data encoding to directly processing quantum data. We target quantum metrology, a practical quantum technology whose precision is often constrained by realistic noise. We develop an experimentally feasible scheme in which a quantum computer optimizes information acquired from quantum metrology, thereby enhancing performance in noisy quantum metrology tasks and overcoming the classical-data-loading bottleneck. We demonstrate this approach through experimental implementation with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and numerical simulations using models of distributed superconducting quantum processors. Our results show that this method improves the accuracy of sensing estimates and significantly boosts sensitivity, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, thus offering a new pathway to harness near-term quantum computers for realistic quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>A Deficiency-Based Framework for the Operational Interpretation of Quantum Resources with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in quantum resource theory lies in establishing operational interpretations by quantifying the distinct advantages that quantum resources provide over classical resources in specific physical tasks. However, conventional quantum resource theories have inherent limitations in characterizing operational advantages for certain quantum tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that defines the resource deficiency of a given state relative to the set of maximal resource states in physical tasks. This extension not only broadens the scope of quantum resource theories and provides more comprehensive operational interpretations, but also delivers crucial insights for classifying and interpreting mixed resource states -- specifically those with inactive resource properties in certain tasks -- that have remained uncharacterized in conventional quantum resource theories. Moreover, we further demonstrate that the proposed geometric measure satisfies the framework's requirements for both quantum coherence and entanglement, while also demonstrating its ability to characterize the operational disadvantage of arbitrary states compared to maximal resource states in subchannel discrimination tasks under specific conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a hybrid quantum system composed of a quantum battery and a coherence-driven charger interacting with a Quantum Autonomous Thermal Machine (QATM). The QATM, made of two qubits, each coupled to Markovian bosonic thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, acts as a structured environment that mediates energy and coherence transfer between the charger and the battery. By applying a coherent driving field on the charger, we investigate the coherence injection effect on the dynamics, including non-Markovianity, power of charging, coherence storage, and ergotropy. We show that the QATM effectively filters the decoherence induced by the thermal baths and induces non-Markovian memory effects due to correlation backflow. Our results demonstrate that coherence driving enhances the battery's ergotropy; coherence driving raises the maximum ergotropy by approximately 40% compared to the case without coherence driving, and the power of charging by preserving the internal energy of the charger and facilitating coherent energy transfer.</description>

Abstract: In our recent work (Sharoglazova et al., Nature 643, 67 (2025)), we reported the measurement of the speed of tunnelling particles using a coupled waveguide system. The measured speed was found to disagree with the standard guiding equation of Bohmian mechanics, which we regard as a challenge to that framework. In the present work, we provide a more detailed account of this issue. In particular, we argue that agreement or disagreement between standard quantum mechanics and Bohmian mechanics on quantities such as particle velocity, speed, tunnelling, and dwell times depends solely on the choice of guiding equation. If this choice is made based on observable spatio-temporal transformation behaviour of the particle density, the two theories agree on these phenomena.</description>

First, we identify a limitation of direct preference optimization (DPO) when used as the loss function in GQE, and propose Persistent-DPO (P-DPO) as a solution to this limitation. Second, as a method to improve the online learning during the training phase of GQE, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines online and offline learning. Using a transformer decoder implementation of GQE, we evaluate our methods through ground state search experiments on the $\mathrm{BeH_2^{}}$ molecule and observe that P-DPO achieves lower energies than DPO. The hybrid approach further improves convergence and final energy values, particularly with P-DPO. A method for imposing upper constraints on the occurrences of specific gates is also presented, which serves to enhance the applicability of GQE.</description>

      <title>Spatial structure of multipartite entanglement at measurement induced phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiparty entanglement near measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), which arise in ensembles of local quantum circuits built with unitaries and measurements. In contrast to equilibrium quantum critical transitions, where entanglement is short-ranged, MIPTs possess long-range k-party genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) characterized by an infinite hierarchy of entanglement exponents for k&gt;=2. First, we represent the average spread of entanglement with "entanglement clusters," and use them to conjecture general exponent relations: 1) classical dominance, 2) monotonicity, 3) subadditivity. We then introduce measure-weighted graphs to construct such clusters in general circuits. Second, we obtain the exact entanglement exponents for a 1d MIPT in a measurement-only circuit that maps to percolation by exploiting non-unitary conformal field theory. The exponents, which we numerically verify, obey the inequalities. We also extend the construction to a 2d MIPT that maps to classical 3d percolation, and numerically find the first entanglement exponents. Our results provide a firm ground to understand the multiparty entanglement of MIPTs, and more general ensembles of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>The quantum smooth label cover problem is undecidable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the quantum smooth label cover problem is undecidable and RE-hard. This sharply contrasts the quantum unique label cover problem, which can be decided efficiently by a result of Kempe, Regev, and Toner (FOCS'08). On the other hand, our result aligns with the RE-hardness of the quantum label cover problem, which follows from the celebrated MIP* = RE result of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen (ACM'21). Additionally, we show that the quantum oracularized smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. Our second result fits with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture recently proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25) on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem. Our proof techniques include a quantum version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96) for BCSMIP*-protocols, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Low Overhead Universal Quantum Computation with Triorthogonal Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the use of triorthogonal codes for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and propose two methods to circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prohibits any single quantum error-correcting code from supporting both universality and a transversal gate set. We show that our methods reduce the resource overhead compared with existing fault-tolerant protocols. We develop a simple fault-tolerant implementation of the logical Hadamard gate for triorthogonal codes by exploiting the fact that they have transversal controlled-Z (CZ) gates, resulting in a circuit with reduced overhead. We also introduce a procedure for generating a symmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane code paired with a triorthogonal code, which allows CNOT and CZ gate transversality across the pair of codes. In addition, we present logical state teleportation circuits that transfer encoded states between the two codes, allowing all logical operations to be performed transversally. Our methods can be integrated into the Steane error correction framework without incurring additional resource cost. Finally, using the 15-qubit code as an example, we demonstrate that our protocols significantly reduce the gate overhead compared with other existing methods. These results highlight the potential of combining distinct code structures to achieve low-overhead, universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>HPQEA: A Scalable and High-Performance Quantum Emulator with High-Bandwidth Memory for Diverse Algorithms Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of quantum emulation. However, existing studies often struggle to achieve broad applicability, high performance, and efficient resource and memory utilization. To address these challenges, we provide HPQEA, a quantum emulator based on the state-vector emulation approach. HPQEA includes three main features: a high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources. Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems with up to 20 qubits. These results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of HPQEA as a platform for emulating quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Proposals for experimentally realizing (mostly) quantum-autonomous gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous quantum machines (AQMs) execute tasks without requiring time-dependent external control. Motivations for AQMs include the restrictions imposed by classical control on quantum machines' coherence times and geometries. Most AQM work is theoretical and abstract; yet an experiment recently demonstrated AQMs' usefulness in qubit reset, crucial to quantum computing. To further reduce quantum computing's classical control, we propose realizations of (fully and partially) quantum-autonomous gates on three platforms: Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. First, we show that a Rydberg-blockade interaction or an ultrafast transition can quantum-autonomously effect entangling gates on Rydberg atoms. One can perform $Z$ or entangling gates on trapped ions mostly quantum-autonomously, by sculpting a linear Paul trap or leveraging a ring trap. Passive lasers control these gates, as well as the Rydberg-atom gates, quantum-autonomously. Finally, circuit quantum electrodynamics can enable quantum-autonomous $Z$ and $XY$ gates on superconducting qubits. The gates can serve as building blocks for (fully or partially) quantum-autonomous circuits, which may reduce classical-control burdens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.</description>

Abstract: A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in real-world applications, such as portfolio optimization, but pose significant computational challenges for large-scale instances. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages neutral atom quantum computing to address QUBO problems by mapping them to the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem on unit disk graphs. Our approach employs spatial grid partitioning to decompose the problem into manageable subgraphs, solves each subgraph using Analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS), and merges solutions greedily to approximate the global optimum. We evaluate the framework on a 50-asset portfolio optimization problem using historical S&amp;P 500 data, benchmarking against classical simulated annealing. Results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the scalability and practical potential of our method in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. As neutral atom quantum hardware advances, our framework offers a promising path toward solving large-scale optimization problems efficiently.</description>

      <title>Transition-Aware Decomposition of Single-Qudit Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation with $d$-level quantum systems, also known as qudits, benefits from the possibility to use a richer computational space compared to qubits. However, for arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native operations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific operations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses. We provide a comparison of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped ions, specifically $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$, $^{137}\text{Ba}^+$ and $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ with different selection rules, and also decomposition for superconducting qudits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources, whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication. Furthermore, we extend the entanglement-assisted circuit knitting framework to the black-box setting, which can be applicable to the circuit knitting of quantum combs. This hybrid approach can be viewed as a form of hybrid classical-quantum computation, balancing the trade-off between sampling and entanglement efficiency, and enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</description>

Abstract: The Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble serves as a qualitative phenomenological model for the level statistics and fractality of eigenstates across the many-body localization transition in static systems. We propose a unitary (circular) analogue of this ensemble, which similarly captures the phenomenology of many-body localization in periodically driven (Floquet) systems. We define this ensemble as the outcome of a Dyson Brownian motion process. We show numerical evidence that this ensemble shares some key statistical properties with the Rosenzweig-Porter ensemble for both the eigenvalues and the eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: When two particles collide in an asymptotically AdS spacetime with high enough energy and small enough impact parameter, they can form a black hole. Motivated by dual quantum circuit considerations, we propose a threshold condition for black hole formation. Intuitively the condition can be understood as the onset of overlap of the butterfly cones describing the ballistic spread of the effect of the perturbations on the boundary systems. We verify the correctness of the condition in three bulk dimensions. We describe a six-point correlation function that can diagnose this condition and compute it in two-dimensional CFTs using eikonal resummation.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</description>

      <title>Quantised helicity in optical media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the definition of optical helicity in a medium. Our approach resolves the problem that duality transformations which simultaneously combine $\mathbf{E}$ with $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ with $\mathbf{B}$ are incompatible with linear constitutive relations. We find that the helicity density in a medium, as the conserved quantity associated with duality transforms, must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and that it can be expressed naturally in terms of the elementary polarised excitations of the system. In media for which the helicity is conserved, each circular excitation carries a well-defined helicity. However, in a medium for which the helicity is not conserved, we find that the time-varying helicity can be viewed in terms of oscillations between different helicity eigenstates, analogous to neutrino oscillations. Here we explicitly study the helicity in homogeneous and lossless media but we believe that, differently to other choices, this helicity is readily generalisable to media that may be inhomogeneous, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal.</description>

      <title>Direct and mediated dipole-dipole interactions in a reconfigurable array of optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum experience both electrostatic and light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, offering a versatile platform to explore mesoscopic entanglement and many-body dynamics. A significant challenge in optical trap arrays is to achieve site-resolved, point-to-point tunability: adjusting the laser parameters of a single trap typically induces global cross-talk to neighboring sites, hindering independent control. Inspired by tunable couplers in superconducting circuits, we implement an ancillary nanoparticle that functions as a coupler between two target nanoparticles. Within a reconfigurable three-particle array, we demonstrate broad tunability of the direct dipole-dipole interaction by controlling the phase and position of the traps. In addition, we observe spectral signatures consistent with mediated interactions between the target particles via the ancillary one, manifested as mode participation beyond the uncoupled response. Our results establish a practical route to tailored, site-resolved control in multi-particle optical trap arrays, expanding the optical-binding toolbox and opening opportunities for programmable oscillator networks relevant to macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored quantum dynamics of non-relativistic, spinless particles propagating in curved spaces with torsion. Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.</description>

      <title>Gold-Standard Chemical Database 137 (GSCDB137): A diverse set of accurate energy differences for assessing and developing density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GSCDB137, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 137 data sets (8377 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, (intramolecular) non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spin-contaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density functional approximations (DFAs) confirms the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall but also reveals notable exceptions: functional performance for frequencies and electric-field properties correlates poorly with that for other ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the meta-GGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment. GSCDB137 offers a comprehensive, openly documented platform for stringent DFA validation and for training the next generation of non-empirical and machine-learned functionals.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</description>

      <title>Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.
  The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.
  Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal decay of (conditional) mutual information in gapped pure- and mixed-state quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases, i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of rotating fermionic superfluids by Sagnac phonon interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover -- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ever since gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) experiments have been proposed as a witness of the quantum nature of gravity, more and more theories of classical gravity coupled to quantum matter have been shown to predict GIE, despite the existence of several theory-independent no-go theorems purportedly claiming that it should not be possible. This note explains why this is possible, and why this makes the GIE experiments an even more urgent matter in quantum gravity research.</description>
