      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for an Arbitrary-Depth Electromagnetic Slot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer is an important topic in computational electromagnetics. To efficiently model this phenomenon, aperture or slot models are often used in conjunction with surface integral equations to solve Maxwell's equations. To establish the credibility of these models, code verification is necessary to assess the correctness of the implementation of the underlying numerical methods. However, many characteristics of surface integral equations and slot models render traditional code-verification approaches ineffective. In this paper, we present approaches to separately measure the different sources of numerical error arising from the method-of-moments implementation of the electric-field integral equation with an arbitrary-depth slot model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for several cases.</description>

      <title>Gradient-enhanced PINN with residual unit for studying forward-inverse problems of variable coefficient equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a powerful emerging method for studying forward-inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs), even from limited sample data. Variable coefficient PDEs, which model real-world phenomena, are of considerable physical significance and research value. This study proposes a gradient-enhanced PINN with residual unit (R-gPINN) method to solve the data-driven solution and function discovery for variable coefficient PDEs. On the one hand, the proposed method incorporates residual units into the neural networks to mitigate gradient vanishing and network degradation, unify linear and nonlinear coefficient problem. We present two types of residual unit structures in this work to offer more flexible solutions in problem-solving. On the other hand, by including gradient terms of variable coefficients, the method penalizes collocation points that fail to satisfy physical properties. This enhancement improves the network's adherence to physical constraints and aligns the prediction function more closely with the objective function. Numerical experiments including solve the forward-inverse problems of variable coefficient Burgers equation, variable coefficient KdV equation, variable coefficient Sine-Gordon equation, and high-dimensional variable coefficient Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. The results show that using R-gPINN method can greatly improve the accuracy of predict solution and predict variable coefficient in solving variable coefficient equations.</description>

      <title>Neural network-augmented eddy viscosity closures for turbulent premixed jet flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending gradient-type turbulence closures to turbulent premixed flames is challenging due to the significant influence of combustion heat release. We incorporate a deep neural network (DNN) into Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models for the turbulent viscosity and thermal conductivity as nonlinear functions of the local flow state and thermochemical gradients. Our models are optimized over the RANS partial differential equations (PDEs) using an adjoint-based data assimilation procedure. Because we directly target the RANS solution, as opposed to the unclosed terms, successfully trained models are guaranteed to improve the in-sample accuracy of the DNN-augmented RANS predictions. We demonstrate the learned closures for in- and out-of-sample $\textit{a posteriori}$ RANS predictions of compressible, premixed, turbulent jet flames with turbulent Damk\"ohler numbers spanning the gradient- and counter-gradient transport regimes. The DNN-augmented RANS predictions have one to two orders of magnitude lower spatiotemporal mean-squared error than those using a baseline $k$--$\epsilon$ model, even for Damk\"ohler numbers far from those used for training. This demonstrates the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of the PDE-constrained modeling approach for turbulent jet flames over this relatively wide Damk\"ohler number range.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical quantum embedding by machine learning for large molecular assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-in-quantum embedding strategy coupled to machine learning potentials to improve on the accuracy of quantum-classical hybrid models for the description of large molecules. In such hybrid models, relevant structural regions (such as those around reaction centers or pockets for binding of host molecules) can be described by a quantum model that is then embedded into a classical molecular-mechanics environment. However, this quantum region may become so large that only approximate electronic structure models are applicable. To then restore accuracy in the quantum description, we here introduce the concept of quantum cores within the quantum region that are amenable to accurate electronic structure models due to their limited size. Huzinaga-type projection-based embedding, for example, can deliver accurate electronic energies obtained with advanced electronic structure methods. The resulting total electronic energies are then fed into a transfer learning approach that efficiently exploits the higher-accuracy data to improve on a machine learning potential obtained for the original quantum-classical hybrid approach. We explore the potential of this approach in the context of a well-studied protein-ligand complex for which we calculate the free energy of binding using alchemical free energy and non-equilibrium switching simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Calculation of Quantum-Classical Binding Free Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accurate description. We propose a general and automated workflow that samples the potential energy surface with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations and trains a machine learning (ML) potential on the QM energies and forces to enable efficient alchemical free energy simulations. To represent systems including many different chemical elements efficiently and to account for the different description of QM and MM atoms, we propose an extension of element-embracing atom-centered symmetry functions for QM/MM data as an ML descriptor. The ML potential approach takes electrostatic embedding and long-range electrostatics into account. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow on the well-studied protein--ligand complex of myeloid cell leukemia 1 and the inhibitor 19G and on the anti-cancer drug NKP1339 acting on the glucose-regulated protein 78.</description>

      <title>Nuclear-electronic calculations need uncontracted basis sets on the quantum protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An attractive way to calculate nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, requiring the solution of coupled Schr\"odinger equations for the electrons and the quantum nuclei. This is commonly known as the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, but it also has many other names. Two types of basis sets are required: a nuclear basis set is required in addition to the usual electronic basis set. In this work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient for NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities converged within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations should always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, since the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions. Uncontracting the basis sets on the quantized protons leads to significantly faster convergence to the basis set limit, leading to improvements of 18 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol in proton affinities employing double-$\zeta$ aug-pc-1 and triple-$\zeta$ aug-pc-2 electronic basis sets, respectively, with little effect on the computational effort. The partially uncontracted aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords proton affinities converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol from the complete basis set limit. Similar results are also obtained with Dunning's correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZP basis sets, albeit at a somewhat slower rate of convergence. As the protonic basis sets yield fully converged values, we find the protonic basis sets to be unnecessarily large for ground state density functional calculations, as the error in the protonic basis set is not balanced with that for typical electronic basis sets.</description>

      <title>A Foundational Potential Energy Surface Dataset for Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate potential energy surface (PES) descriptions are essential for atomistic simulations of materials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs)$^{1-3}$ offer a computationally efficient alternative to density functional theory (DFT)$^4$ for PES modeling across the periodic table. However, their accuracy today is fundamentally constrained due to a reliance on DFT relaxation data.$^{5,6}$ Here, we introduce MatPES, a foundational PES dataset comprising $\sim 400,000$ structures carefully sampled from 281 million molecular dynamics snapshots that span 16 billion atomic environments. We demonstrate that UMLIPs trained on the modestly sized MatPES dataset can rival, or even outperform, prior models trained on much larger datasets across a broad range of equilibrium, near-equilibrium, and molecular dynamics property benchmarks. We also introduce the first high-fidelity PES dataset based on the revised regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed (r$^2$SCAN) functional$^7$ with greatly improved descriptions of interatomic bonding. The open source MatPES initiative emphasizes the importance of data quality over quantity in materials science and enables broad community-driven advancements toward more reliable, generalizable, and efficient UMLIPs for large-scale materials discovery and design.</description>

Abstract: Experiments reveal negative (non-Laplacian) surface stresses in metal oxide nanoparticles, partly associated with humidity during fabrication and annealing. Using a neural network interatomic potential for MgO, we prove that water adsorption induces surface hydroxylation, shifting facets from {100} to {110} to {111} and switching the average surface stress from positive to negative. Predicted lattice strains versus nanoparticle size agree well with experiments, clarifying experimental correlations. The new framework informs broad applications in catalysis, sensors, batteries, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>T-MSD: An improved method for ionic diffusion coefficient calculation from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionic conductivity is a critical property of solid ionic conductors, directly influencing the performance of energy storage devices such as batteries. However, accurately calculating ionic conductivity or diffusion coefficient remains challenging due to the complex, dynamic nature of ionic motion, which often yield significant deviations, especially at room temperature. In this study, we propose an improved method, T-MSD, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of diffusion coefficient calculations. Combining time-averaged mean square displacement analysis with block jackknife resampling, this method effectively addresses the impact of rare, anomalous diffusion events and provides robust statistical error estimates from a single simulation. Applied to large-scale deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations, we show that T-MSD eliminates the need for multiple independent simulations while ensuring accurate diffusion coefficient calculations across systems of varying sizes and simulation durations. This approach offers a practical and reliable framework for precise ionic conductivity estimation, advancing the study and design of high-performance solid ionic conductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric induced magneto-optical effects in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-optical effects (MOEs), as a fundamental physical phenomenon, can reveal the electronic structures of materials. The related probing methods are widely used in the study of magnetic materials. However, space-time inversion ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric antiferromagnets were previously believed to be magneto-optically inactive. Here, we point out that this traditional understanding is incorrect. Based on our generic formulas and symmetry analysis, we find that in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets, it is the quantum metric, i.e., the real part of the quantum geometry, that induces MOEs. Combining a tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we confirm this observation by showing MOEs in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets previously thought to lack MOEs can indeed exhibit MOEs and greatly broaden the research on MOEs.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: a multi-dimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

Abstract: The boundary layer represents a fundamental structure in fluid dynamics, where accurate boundary discretization significantly enhances computational efficiency. This paper presents a third-order boundary discretization for compact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS). Wide stencils and curved boundaries pose challenges in the boundary treatment for high-order schemes, particularly for temporal accuracy. By utilizing a time-dependent gas distribution function, the GKS simultaneously evaluates fluxes and updates flow variables at cell interfaces, enabling the concurrent update of cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients within the third-order compact scheme. The proposed one-sided discretization achieves third-order spatial accuracy on boundary cells by utilizing updated flow variables and gradients in the discretization for non-slip wall boundary conditions. High-order temporal accuracy on boundary cells is achieved through the GKS time-dependent flux implementation with multi-stage multi-derivative methodology. Additionally, we develop exact no-penetration conditions for both adiabatic and isothermal wall boundaries, with extensions to curved mesh geometries to fully exploit the advantages of high-order schemes. Comparative analysis between the proposed one-sided third-order boundary scheme, third-order boundary scheme with ghost cells, and second-order boundary scheme demonstrates significant performance differences for the third-order compact GKS. Results indicate that lower-order boundary cell treatments yield substantially inferior results, while the proposed third-order treatment demonstrates superior performance, particularly on coarse grid configurations.</description>

      <title>QE-CONVERSE: An open-source package for the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution to compute non-perturbatively orbital magnetization from first principles, including NMR chemical shifts and EPR parameters</title>

Abstract: Orbital magnetization, a key property arising from the orbital motion of electrons, plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior of molecules and solids. Despite its straightforward calculation in finite systems, the computation in periodic systems poses challenges due to the ill-defined position operator and surface current contributions. The modern theory of orbital magnetization, implemented in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, offers an accurate solution via the "converse approach." Here, we introduce QE-CONVERSE, a refactored, modular implementation of this method, replacing outdated routines from Quantum ESPRESSO (version 3.2). QE-CONVERSE integrates modern computational libraries like scaLAPACK and ELPA, enhancing scalability, especially for large supercell calculations. This work focuses on providing the community with a reliable, accurate orbital magnetization package for properties such as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) g-tensors and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, particularly where perturbative methods fail. We demonstrate QE-CONVERSE's effectiveness with benchmark cases, including the NMR shifts of ${}^{27}$Al in alumina and ${}^{17}$O and ${}^{29}$Si in $\alpha$-quartz, as well as the EPR g-tensor for $_{ }^{n}\Sigma(n\geq 2)$ radicals and nitrogen defects in silicon. Results show excellent agreement with theoretical and experimental data, with improved accuracy in EPR calculations over linear response methods. QE-CONVERSE is fully compatible with recent Quantum ESPRESSO versions, enabling new possibilities for studying complex materials</description>

      <title>A linearly-implicit energy preserving scheme for geometrically nonlinear mechanics based on non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel formulation and numerical strategy for the simulation of geometrically nonlinear structures. First, a non-canonical Hamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of the stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\'arm\'an nonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as finite strain elasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both negligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former case the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the dynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element discretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation for displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor representation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is proposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit energy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically condensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a positive definite matrix. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on the Duffing oscillator, a von-K\'arm\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite strain elasticity. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the explicit Newmark scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining energy stability. Additionally, it enables larger time steps compared to explicit schemes and exhibits computational efficiency comparable to the leapfrog method.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent discretization of 1D thermal-fluid models using their metriplectic 4-bracket structure</title>

Abstract: Thermodynamically consistent models in continuum physics, i.e. models which satisfy the first and second laws of thermodynamics, may be expressed using the metriplectic formalism. In this work, we leverage the structures underlying this modeling formalism to preserve thermodynamic consistency in discretizations of a fluid model. The procedure relies (1) on ensuring that the spatial semi-discretization retains certain symmetries and degeneracies of the Poisson and metriplectic 4-brackets, and (2) on the use of an appropriate energy conserving time-stepping method. The minimally simple yet nontrivial example of a one-dimensional thermal-fluid model is treated. It is found that preservation of the requisite symmetries and degeneracies of the 4-bracket is relatively simple to ensure in Galerkin spatial discretizations, suggesting a path forward for thermodynamically consistent discretizations of more complex fluid models using more specialized Galerkin methods.</description>

      <title>Particle Trajectory Prediction in Discrete Element Simulations using a Graph-Based Interaction-Aware Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the applicability of a graph-based interaction-aware trajectory prediction model, originally developed for the transportation domain, to forecast particle trajectories in three-dimensional discrete element simulations. The model and our enhancements are validated at two typical particle simulation use cases: (i) particle flow in a representative unit cell with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in combination with sinusoidal velocity profile and (ii) shear flow in a representative unit cell with Lees-Edwards boundary conditions (LEBCs). For the models to learn the particle behavior subjected to these boundary conditions requires additional data transformation and feature engineering, which we introduce. Furthermore, we introduce and compare two novel training procedures for the adapted prediction model, which we call position-centric training (PCT) and velocity-centric training (VCT). The results show that the models developed for the transportation domain can be adapted to learn the behavior of particles in discrete element simulations.</description>

      <title>Node-reconfiguring multilayer networks of human brain function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional brain network properties are heavily influenced by how the the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), i.e., predetermined collections of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement voxels, as nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines, which can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer links quantify the overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs with intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.</description>

      <title>On the Influence of Parallax Effects in Thick Silicon Sensors in Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

Abstract: Structure determination is a key application of XFELs and 4th generation synchrotron sources, particularly using the coherent and pulsed X-ray radiation from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). Scientific interest focuses on understanding the physical, biological, and chemical properties of samples at the nanometer scale. The X-rays from XFELs enable Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI), where coherent X-rays irradiate a sample, and a far-field diffraction pattern is captured by an imaging detector. By the nature of the underlying physics, the resolution, at which the sample can be probed with the CXDI technique, is limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the exposure time if a detector can record the diffraction pattern to very large scattering angles. The resolution that can be achieved under real experimental conditions, depends strongly on additional parameters. The Shannon pixel size, linked to the detector resolution, the coherent dose that can be deposited in the sample without changing its structure, the image contrast, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected scattered radiation at high $q$, i.e. at high scattering angles $2\Theta$, have a strong influence on the resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio at high $q$ defines the "effective" maximum solid angle in a specific experiment setup up to which a detector can efficiently detect a signal and in consequence determines the achievable resolution. The image contrast defines how well bright image features can be distinguished from dark ones. We present the preliminary results of our study on the influence of the PSF on SNR, image contrast, position resolution, and achievable sample resolution for different pixel sizes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependence of spin-phonon relaxation and dephasing due to g-factor fluctuations from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electron spin decay lifetime in materials can be characterized by relaxation (T1) and irreversible (T2) and reversible (T2*) decoherence processes. Their interplay leads to a complex dependence of spin relaxation times on the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, relevant for spintronics and quantum information applications. Here, we use real-time first-principles density matrix dynamics simulations to directly simulate Hahn echo measurements, disentangle dephasing from decoherence, and predict T1, T2 and T2* spin lifetimes. We show that g-factor fluctuations lead to non-trivial magnetic field dependence of each of these lifetimes in inversion-symmetric crystals of CsPbBr3 and silicon, even when only intrinsic spin-phonon scattering is present. Most importantly, fluctuations in the off-diagonal components of the g-tensor lead to a strong magnetic field dependence of even the T1 lifetime in silicon. Our calculations elucidate the detailed role of anisotropic g-factors in determining the spin dynamics even in simple, low spin-orbit coupling materials such as silicon.</description>

      <title>Multiscale thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and their relative importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex kinetics of thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) and their relative importance during the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) using high-order discrete Boltzmann models (DBMs). First, the capabilities and differences among various discrete velocity sets in capturing TNEs and distribution functions are assessed. Practical guidelines for constructing discrete velocity stencils are proposed to enhance phase-space discretization and improve the robustness of high-order DBM simulation. At different stages of KHI and under varying initial conditions, multiscale TNEs, such as viscous stresses of different orders, emerge with distinct dominant roles. Specifically, three scenarios are identified: (i) regimes dominated by first-order TNEs,(ii) alternation between first- and second-order TNEs, and (iii) states where second-order TNEs govern the system's behavior. To quantitatively capture these transitions, criteria for TNE dominance at different orders in KHI evolution are established based on the relative thermodynamic nonequilibrium intensity (\(R_{\text{TNE}}\)). In scenarios dominated by second-order TNEs, differences between first-order and second-order models are compared in terms of macroscopic quantities, nonequilibrium effects, and kinetic moments, revealing the physical limitations of low-order models in capturing TNEs. Furthermore, the effectiveness, extensibility, and limitations of a representative high-order model are examined under second-order TNE-dominated conditions. To encapsulate these findings, a nonequilibrium phase diagram that visually maps the multiscale characteristics of KHI is constructed. This diagram not only provides intuitive insights into the dynamic interplay of different nonequilibrium effects but also serves as a kinetic roadmap for selecting suitable models under diverse nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing fast and accurate surrogate models is a key ingredient for making robust predictions in many topics. We introduce a new model, the Multiparameter Eigenvalue Problem (MEP) emulator. The new method connects emulators and can make predictions directly from observables to observables. We present that the MEP emulator can be trained with data from Eigenvector Continuation (EC) and Parametric Matrix Model (PMM) emulators. A simple simulation on a one-dimensional lattice confirms the performance of the MEP emulator. Using $^{28}$O as an example, we also demonstrate that the predictive probability distribution of the target observables can be easily obtained through the new emulator.</description>
