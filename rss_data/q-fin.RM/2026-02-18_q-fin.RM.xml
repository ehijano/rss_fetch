      <title>Autodeleveraging as Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism used by perpetual futures venues when liquidation and insurance buffers are insufficient to restore solvency. Despite the scale of perpetual futures markets, ADL has received limited formal treatment as a sequential control problem. This paper provides a concise formalization of ADL as online learning on a PNL-haircut domain: at each round, the venue selects a solvency budget and a set of profitable trader accounts. The profitable accounts are liquidated to cover shortfalls up to the solvency budget, with the aim of recovering exchange-wide solvency. In this model, ADL haircuts apply to positive PNL (unrealized gains), not to posted collateral principal. Using our online learning model, we provide robustness results and theoretical upper bounds on how poorly a mechanism can perform at recovering solvency. We apply our model to the October 10, 2025 Hyperliquid stress episode. The regret caused by Hyperliquid's production ADL queue is about 50\% of an upper bound on regret, calibrated to this event, while our optimized algorithm achieves about 2.6\% of the same bound. In dollar terms, the production ADL model over liquidates trader profits by up to \$51.7M. We also counterfactually evaluated algorithms inspired by our online learning framework that perform better and found that the best algorithm reduces overshoot to \$3M. Our results provide simple, implementable mechanisms for improving ADL in live perpetuals exchanges.</description>

      <title>From Chain-Ladder to Individual Claims Reserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15385v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chain-ladder (CL) method is the most widely used claims reserving technique in non-life insurance. This manuscript introduces a novel approach to computing the CL reserves based on a fundamental restructuring of the data utilization for the CL prediction procedure. Instead of rolling forward the cumulative claims with estimated CL factors, we estimate multi-period factors that project the latest observations directly to the ultimate claims. This alternative perspective on CL reserving creates a natural pathway for the application of machine learning techniques to individual claims reserving. As a proof of concept, we present a small-scale real data application employing neural networks for individual claims reserving.</description>

      <title>Combination of traditional and parametric insurance: calibration method based on the optimization of a criterion adapted to heavy tail losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of providing insurance protection against heavy-tailed losses, for which the expected loss may not even be finite. The product we study is based on a combination of traditional insurance up to a given limit and a parametric (or index-based) cover for larger losses. This second component of the coverage is computed from covariates available immediately after the loss occurs, allowing claim management costs to be reduced through rapid compensation. To optimize the design of this second component, we use a criterion adapted to extreme losses, that is, to loss distributions of Pareto type. We support the calibration procedure with theoretical results establishing its convergence rate, as well as empirical evidence from both a simulation study and a real-data analysis on tornado losses in the United States. We also propose a two-step optimization procedure as a potential solution to the issue of data scarcity in the tails of loss distributions. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that the proposed hybrid contract outperforms a traditional capped indemnity contract.</description>

      <title>Index insurance under demand and solvency constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Index insurance is often proposed to reduce protection gaps, especially for emerging risks. Unlike traditional insurance, it bases compensation on a measurable index, enabling faster payouts and lower claim management costs. This approach benefits both policyholders, through quick payments, and insurers, through reduced costs and better risk control due to reliable data and robust statistical estimates. An important difference with the concept of Cat Bonds is that the feasibility of such coverage relies on the possibility of mutualization. Mutualization, in turn, is achieved only if a sufficiently high number of policyholders agree to subscribe. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a model for the demand for index insurance and to provide conditions under which the solvency of the portfolio is achieved. From these conditions, we deduce a product that combines index and traditional indemnity insurance in order to benefit from the best of both approaches. We illustrate our results with a practical example involving the design of an index insurance product in the field of cyber insurance.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Model-Free Valuation Approach: Hedging Gaps, Conservatism, and Trading Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the quality of model-free valuation approaches for financial derivatives by systematically evaluating the difference between model-free super-hedging strategies and the realized payoff of financial derivatives using historical option prices from several constituents of the S&amp;P 500 between 2018 and 2022.
  Our study allows in particular to describe the realized gap between payoff and model-free hedging strategy empirically so that we can quantify to which degree model-free approaches are overly conservative. Our results imply that the model-free hedging approach is only marginally more conservative than industry-standard models such as the Heston-model while being model-free at the same time.
  This finding, its statistical description and the model-independence of the hedging approach enable us to construct an explicit trading strategy which, as we demonstrate, can be profitably applied in financial markets, and additionally possesses the desirable feature with an explicit control of its downside risk due to its model-free construction preventing losses pathwise.</description>

      <title>Autodeleveraging: Impossibilities and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism for perpetual futures venues. It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \emph{solvency}, \emph{revenue}, and \emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. On the positive side, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing production ADL to transparent benchmark allocations, we find that Hyperliquid's production algorithm overshot the minimum trader profit haircut required to cover the shortfall. Our methodology suggests the excess profits lost by profitable traders is between \$45.0M and \$51.7M. In terms of the positions liquidated, this corresponds to roughly \$653.6M of positions being closed. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results show both theoretically and empirically that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce losses of trader profitability while maintaining exchange solvency.</description>
