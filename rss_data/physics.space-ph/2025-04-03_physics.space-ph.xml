      <title>High-Resolution Observations of a Small-Scale Cancellation Nanoflare: Supporting Evidence for the Cancellation Nanoflare Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical cancellation nanoflare model has recently been established to show the fundamental role that ubiquitous small-scale cancellation nanoflares play in solar atmospheric heating. Although this model is well-supported by simulations, observational evidence is needed to deepen our understanding of cancellation nanoflares. We present observations of a small-scale cancellation nanoflare event, analyzing its magnetic topology evolution, triggers, and physical parameters. Using coordinated observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory and Goode Solar Telescope, we identify a photospheric flow-driven cancellation event with a flux cancellation rate of ~10^{15} Mx/s and a heating rate of 8.7 x 10^6 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The event shows the characteristic transition from $\pi$-shaped to X-shaped magnetic configuration before forming a two arcsecs current sheet, closely matching model predictions. This event provides critical observational support for the cancellation nanoflare model and its role in solar atmospheric heating.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray ionisation of a post-impact early Earth atmosphere: Solar cosmic ray ionisation must be considered in origin-of-life scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CR), both solar and Galactic, have an ionising effect on the Earth's atmosphere and are thought to be important for prebiotic molecule production. In particular, the $\rm{H_2}$-dominated atmosphere following an ocean-vaporising impact is considered favourable to prebiotic molecule formation. We model solar and Galactic CR transport through a post-impact early Earth atmosphere at 200Myr. We aim to identify the differences in the resulting ionisation rates, $\zeta$, particularly at the Earth's surface during a period when the Sun was very active. We use a Monte Carlo model to describe CR transport through the early Earth atmosphere, giving the CR spectra as a function of altitude. We calculate $\zeta$ and the ion-pair production rate, $Q$, as a function of altitude due to Galactic and solar CR. The Galactic and solar CR spectra are both affected by the Sun's rotation rate, $\Omega$, because the solar wind velocity and magnetic field strength both depend on $\Omega$ and influence CR transport. We consider a range of input spectra resulting from the range of possible $\Omega$, from $3.5-15\, \Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. To account for the possibility that the Galactic CR spectrum outside the Solar System varies over Gyr timescales, we compare top-of-atmosphere $\zeta$ resulting from two different scenarios. We also consider the suppression of the CR spectra by a planetary magnetic field. We find that $\zeta$ and $Q$ due to CR are dominated by solar CR in the early Earth atmosphere for most cases. The corresponding $\zeta$ at the early Earth's surface ranges from $5 \times 10^{-21}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 3.5\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$ to $1 \times 10^{-16}\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\Omega = 15\,\Omega_{\rm{\odot}}$. Thus if the young Sun was a fast rotator, it is likely that solar CR had a significant effect on the chemistry at the Earth's surface at the time when life is likely to have formed.</description>

      <title>Electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid waves during asymmetric reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission data to investigate electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid drift waves during magnetopause reconnection. We analyze waves observed in an electron-scale plasma mixing layer at the edge of the magnetospheric outflow. Using high-resolution 7.5 ms electron moments, we obtain an electron current density with a Nyquist frequency of ~66 Hz, sufficient to resolve most of the lower hybrid drift wave power observed in the event. We then employ wavelet analysis to evaluate dJ.dE, which accounts for the phase differences between the fluctuating quantities. The analysis shows that the energy exchange is localized within the plasma mixing layer, and it is highly fluctuating, with energy bouncing between waves and electrons throughout the analyzed time and frequency range. However, the cumulative sum over time indicates a net energy transfer from the waves to electrons. We observe an anomalous electron flow toward the magnetosphere, consistent with diffusion and electron mixing. These results indicate that waves and electrons interact dynamically to dissipate the excess internal energy accumulated by sharp density gradients. We conclude that the electron temperature profile within the plasma mixing layer is produced by a combination of electron diffusion across the layer, as well as heating by large-scale parallel potential and lower hybrid drift waves.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Particle Transport at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>
