      <title>Roman domination in weighted graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Roman dominating function for a (non-weighted) graph $G=(V,E)$, is a function $f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that every vertex $u\in V$ with $f(u)=0$ has at least {one} neighbor $v\in V$ such that $f(v)=2$. The minimum weight $\sum_{v\in V}f(v)$ of a Roman {dominating function} $f$ on $G$ is called the Roman domination number of $G$ and is denoted by $\gamma_{R}(G)$. A graph {$G= (V,E)$} together with a positive real-valued weight-function $w:V\rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{&gt;0}$ is called a {\it weighted graph} and is denoted by $(G;w)$. The minimum weight $\sum_{v\in V}f(v)w(v)$ of a Roman {dominating function} $f$ on $G$ is called the weighted Roman domination number of $G$ and is denoted by $\gamma_{wR}(G)$. The domination and Roman domination numbers of unweighted graphs have been extensively studied, particularly for their applications in bioinformatics and computational biology. However, graphs used to model biomolecular structures often require weights to be biologically meaningful. In this paper, we initiate the study of the weighted Roman domination number in weighted graphs. We first establish several bounds for this parameter and present various realizability results. Furthermore, we determine the exact values for several well-known graph families and demonstrate an equivalence between the weighted Roman domination number and the differential of a weighted graph.</description>

      <title>Learning with the $p$-adics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing machine learning frameworks operate over the field of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) and learn representations in real (Euclidean or Hilbert) vector spaces (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^d$). Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization.
  But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals. We finish by discussing open problems and opportunities for future research enabled by this new framework.</description>

      <title>Proper conflict-free choosability of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proper conflict-free coloring of a graph is a proper vertex coloring wherein each non-isolated vertex's open neighborhood contains at least one color appearing exactly once. For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is said to be proper conflict-free (degree+$k$)-choosable if given any list assignment $L$ for $G$ where $|L(v)| = d(v) + k$ holds for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, there exists a proper conflict-free coloring $\phi$ of $G$ such that $\phi(v) \in L(v)$ for all $v \in V(G)$. Recently, Kashima, \v{S}krekovski, and Xu proposed two related conjectures on proper conflict-free choosability: the first asserts the existence of an absolute constant $k$ such that every graph is proper conflict-free (degree+$k$)-choosable, while the second strengthens this claim by restricting to connected graphs other than the cycle of length 5 and reducing the constant to $k=2$. In this paper, we confirm the second conjecture for three graph classes: $K_4$-minor-free graphs with maximum degree at most 4, outer-1-planar graphs with maximum degree at most 4, and planar graphs with girth at least 12; we also confirm the first conjecture for these same graph classes, in addition to all outer-1-planar graphs (without degree constraints). Moreover, we prove that planar graphs with girth at least 12 and outer-1-planar graphs are proper conflict-free $6$-choosable.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithm for $S$-packing coloring of Halin graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by frequency assignment problems in wireless broadcast networks, Goddard, Hedetniemi, Hedetniemi, Harris, and Rall introduced the notion of $S$-packing coloring in 2008. Given a non-decreasing sequence $S = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k)$ of positive integers, an $S$-packing coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of its vertex set into $k$ subsets $\{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq k$, the distance between any two distinct vertices $u, v \in V_i$ is at least $s_i + 1$. In this paper, we study the $S$-packing coloring problem for Halin graphs with maximum degree $\Delta \leq 5$. Specifically, we present a linear-time algorithm that constructs a $(1,1,2,2,2)$-packing coloring for any Halin graph satisfying $\Delta \leq 5$. It is worth noting that there are Halin graphs that are not $(1,2,2,2)$-packing colorable.</description>

      <title>Exact rainbow numbers of cycle-related graphs in multi-hubbed wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rainbow number ${\rm rb}(G, H)$ is the minimum number of colors $k$ for which any edge-coloring of $G$ with at least $k$ colors guarantees a rainbow subgraph isomorphic to $H$. The rainbow number has many applications in diverse fields such as wireless communication networks, cryptography, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. In this paper, we determine the exact rainbow number $\mathrm{rb}(G, H)$ where $G$ is a multi-hubbed wheel graph $W_d(s)$, defined as the join of $s$ isolated vertices and a cycle $C_d$ of length $d$ (i.e., $W_d(s) = \overline{K_s} + C_d$), and $H = \theta_{t,\ell}$ represents a cycle $C_t$ of length $t$ with $0 \leq \ell \leq t-3$ chords emanating from a common vertex, by establishing \[ {\rm rb}(W_{d}(s), \theta_{t,\ell}) = \begin{cases} \left\lfloor \dfrac{2t - 5}{t - 2}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } \ell=t-3,~s = 1 \text{ and } t\ge 4, \\[10pt] \left\lfloor \dfrac{3t-10}{t - 3}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } \ell=t-3,~s = 2\text{ and } t\ge 6,\\[10pt] \left\lfloor \dfrac{(s + 1)t - (3s + 4)}{t - 3}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } \ell=t-3,~s \geq 3\text{ and } t\ge 7,\\[10pt] \left\lfloor \dfrac{2t - 7}{t - 3}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } s = 1 \text{ and } t\ge \max\{5,\ell+4\}, \end{cases} \] when $d\geq 3t-5$, with all bounds for the parameter $t$ presented here being tight. This addresses the problems proposed by Jakhar, Budden, and Moun (2025), which involve investigating the rainbow numbers of large cycles and large chorded cycles in wheel graphs (specifically corresponding to the cases in our framework where $s=1$ and $\ell\in \{0,1\}$). Furthermore, it completely determines the rainbow numbers of cycles of arbitrary length in large wheel graphs, thereby generalizing a result of Lan, Shi, and Song (2019).</description>

      <title>Computing parameters that generalize interval graphs using restricted modular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Lafond and Luo [MFCS 2023] defined the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality of a graph $G$ as the minimum size of a partition of $V(G)$ into modules that belong to a graph class $\mathcal{G}$. We analyze the complexity of calculating parameters that generalize interval graphs when parameterized by the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality, where $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds either to the class of interval graphs or to the union of complete graphs. Namely, we analyze the complexity of computing the thinness and the simultaneous interval number of a graph.
  We present a linear kernel for the Thinness problem parameterized by the interval-modular cardinality and an FPT algorithm for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the cluster-modular cardinality plus the solution size. The interval-modular cardinality of a graph is not greater than the cluster-modular cardinality, which in turn generalizes the neighborhood diversity and the twin-cover number. Thus, our results imply a linear kernel for Thinness when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity of the input graph, FPT algorithms for Thinness when parameterized by the twin-cover number and vertex cover number, and FPT algorithms for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity plus the solution size, twin-cover number, and vertex cover number. To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work no parameterized algorithms (FPT or XP) for computing the thinness or the simultaneous interval number were known.
  On the negative side, we observe that Thinness and Simultaneous Interval Number parameterized by treewidth, pathwidth, bandwidth, (linear) mim-width, clique-width, modular-width, or even the thinness or simultaneous interval number themselves, admit no polynomial kernels assuming NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Bicriteria Approximation Algorithm for the Art Gallery Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a polygon $H$ in the plane, the art gallery problem calls for fining the smallest set of points in $H$ from which every other point in $H$ is seen. We give a deterministic algorithm that, given any polygon $H$ with $h$ holes, $n$ rational veritces of maximum bit-length $L$, and a parameter $\delta \in(0,1)$, is guaranteed to find a set of points in $H$ of size $O\big(\OPT\cdot\log(h+2)\cdot\log (\OPT\cdot\log(h+2)))$ that sees at least a $(1-\delta)$-fraction of the area of the polygon. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial in $h$, $n$, $L$ and $\log(\frac{1}{\delta})$, where $\OPT$ is the size of an optimum solution.</description>

      <title>Two-colorings of finite grids: variations on a theorem of Tibor Gallai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated but non-effective theorem of Tibor Gallai states that for any finite set $A$ of $\Z^n$ and for any finite number of colors $c$ there is a minimal $m$ such that no coloring of the finite $m^n$-grid can avoid that a homothetic image of $A$ is monochromatic. We find (or confirm) $m$ for equilateral triangles, squares, and various types of rectangles. Also, we extend the problem from homothety to general similarity, or to similarity generated using some special rotations. In particular, we compute Gallai similarity numbers for lattice rectangles similar to $1\times k$ (in all orientations) for $k=2,3,4$. The solutions have been found in the framework of the Satisfiability Problem in Propositional Logic (SAT). While some questions were solved using managed brute force, for the more computationally intensive questions we used modern SAT solvers together with symmetry breaking techniques. Some other minor questions are solved for triangles and squares, and new lower bounds are found for regular hexagons on the triangular lattice and for three-dimensional cubes in $\Z^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, the best circle graph recognition algorithm runs in almost linear time as it relies on a split decomposition algorithm that uses the union-find data-structure. We show that in the case of circle graphs, the PC-tree data-structure allows one to avoid the union-find data-structure to compute the split decomposition in linear time. As a consequence, we obtain the first linear-time recognition algorithm for circle graphs.</description>

      <title>Identifying faulty edges in resistive electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a resistive electrical network, we would like to determine whether all the resistances (edges) in the network are working, and if not, identify which edge (or edges) are faulty. To make this determination, we are allowed to measure the effective resistance between certain pairs of nodes (which can be done by measuring the amount of current when one unit of voltage difference is applied at the chosen pair of nodes). The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal.</description>

      <title>Coloring Hardness on Low Twin-Width Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the class $\mathcal T_4$ of graphs of twin-width at most 4 contains every finite subgraph of the infinite grid and every graph obtained by subdividing each edge of an $n$-vertex graph at least $2 \log n$ times, most NP-hard graph problems, like Max Independent Set, Dominating Set, Hamiltonian Cycle, remain so on $\mathcal T_4$. However, Min Coloring and k-Coloring are easy on both families because they are 2-colorable and 3-colorable, respectively.
  We show that Min Coloring is NP-hard on the class $\mathcal T_3$ of graphs of twin-width at most 3. This is the first hardness result on $\mathcal T_3$ for a problem that is easy on cographs (twin-width 0), on trees (whose twin-width is at most 2), and on unit circular-arc graphs (whose twin-width is at most 3). We also show that for every $k \geqslant 3$, k-Coloring is NP-hard on $\mathcal T_4$. We finally make two observations: (1) there are currently very few problems known to be in P on $\mathcal T_d$ (graphs of twin-width at most $d$) and NP-hard on $\mathcal T_{d+1}$ for some nonnegative integer $d$, and (2) unlike $\mathcal T_4$, which contains every graph as an induced minor, the class $\mathcal T_3$ excludes a fixed planar graph as an induced minor; thus it may be viewed as a special case (or potential counterexample) for conjectures about classes excluding a (planar) induced minor. These observations are accompanied by several open questions.</description>

      <title>Concentration via metastable mixing, with applications to the supercritical exponential random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Folklore belief holds that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We make this rigorous in the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We make use of the supercritical (low-temperature) metastable mixing which was recently proven by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani, and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the ERGM in a large metastable well, answering a question posed by those authors. To achieve this, we prove a new connectivity property for metastable mixing in the ERGM and introduce a new general result yielding concentration inequalities, which extends a result of Chatterjee. We also use a result of Barbour, Brightwell, and Luczak to cover all cases of interest. Our work extends a result of Ganguly and Nam from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to metastable wells, and we also extend applications of this concentration, namely a central limit theorem for small subcollections of edges and a bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM and the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we present a simulation study of metastable wells in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>Quasilinearization with regularizing tensor paraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Bony's celebrated work on paraproducts to continous and multiscale \emph{tensor} paraproducts. For $A \in \mathcal{C}^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $f \in \Lambda_{\alpha}([0,1]^2, d_d(x,y)^{\alpha} \times d'_d(x',y')^{\alpha})$, we construct an approximation, $\tilde{A}_{(N,N')}(f)$ to $A(f)$, replacing the operator $T: f \to A(f)$ with the continous tensor paraproduct, $\Pi^{(t,t')}_{(A',A'')}$, and the multiscale tensor paraproduct $\Pi^{(N,N')}_{(A',A'')}:f \to \tilde{A}_{(N,N')}(f) + \Delta_{ (N,N')}(A,f)$. In the multiscale case, we provide estimates on the residual, $\Delta_{(N,N')}(A,f)$, and show it has twice the regularity of $f$ such that $\Delta_{(N,N')}(A,f) \in \Lambda_{2 \alpha}([0,1]^2)$ and $\lVert \Delta_{(N,N')}(A,f) \rVert_{\Lambda_{2\alpha}([0,1]^2)} \leq C_A \lVert f \rVert_{\Lambda_{\alpha}([0,1]^2)} $.

      <title>Colouring Probe $H$-Free Graphs</title>

Abstract: The NP-complete problems Colouring and k-Colouring $(k\geq 3$) are well studied on $H$-free graphs, i.e., graphs that do not contain some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. We research to what extent the known polynomial-time algorithms for $H$-free graphs can be generalized if we only know some of the edges of the input graph. We do this by considering the classical probe graph model introduced in the early nineties. For a graph $H$, a partitioned probe $H$-free graph $(G,P,N)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a set $P\subseteq V$ of probes and an independent set $N=V\setminus P$ of non-probes, such that $G+F$ is $H$-free for some edge set $F\subseteq \binom{N}{2}$. We first fully classify the complexity of Colouring on partitioned probe $H$-free graphs and show that this dichotomy is different from the known dichotomy of Colouring for $H$-free graphs. Our main result is a dichotomy of $3$-Colouring for partitioned probe $P_t$-free graphs: we prove that the problem is polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 5$ but NP-complete if $t\geq 6$. In contrast, $3$-Colouring on $P_t$-free graphs is known to be polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 7$ and quasi polynomial-time solvable for $t\geq 8$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

      <title>On the Incompressibility of Truth With Application to Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21738v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of Circuit Complexity and the nature of efficient computation from a fresh perspective. We present a framework for understanding Circuit Complexity through the lens of Information Theory with analogies to results in Kolmogorov Complexity, viewing circuits as descriptions of truth tables, encoded in logical gates and wires, rather than purely computational devices. From this framework, we re-prove some existing Circuit Complexity bounds, explain what the optimal circuits for most boolean functions look like structurally, give an explicit boolean function family that requires exponential circuits, and explain the aforementioned results in a unifying intuition that re-frames time entirely.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Toward P vs NP: An Observer-Theoretic Separation via SPDP Rank and a ZFC-Equivalent Foundation within the N-Frame Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11820v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained separation framework for P vs NP developed entirely within ZFC. The approach consists of: (i) a deterministic, radius-1 compilation from uniform polynomial-time Turing computation to local sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomials with polylogarithmic contextual entanglement width (CEW); (ii) a formal Width-to-Rank upper bound for the resulting SPDP matrices at matching parameters; (iii) an NP-side identity-minor lower bound in the same encoding; and (iv) a rank-monotone, instance-uniform extraction map from the compiled P-side polynomials to the NP family. Together these yield a contradiction under the assumption P = NP, establishing a separation.
  We develop a correspondence between CEW, viewed as a quantitative measure of computational contextuality, and SPDP rank, yielding a unified criterion for complexity separation. We prove that bounded-CEW observers correspond to polynomial-rank computations (the class P), while unbounded CEW characterizes the class NP. This implies that exponential SPDP rank for #3SAT and related hard families forces P != NP within the standard framework of complexity theory.
  Key technical components include: (1) constructive lower bounds on SPDP rank via Ramanujan-Tseitin expander families; (2) a non-circular reduction from Turing-machine computation to low-rank polynomial evaluation; (3) a codimension-collapse lemma ensuring that rank amplification cannot occur within polynomial resources; and (4) proofs of barrier immunity against relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization. The result is a complete ZFC proof architecture whose primitives and compositions are fully derived, with community verification and machine-checked formalization left as future work.</description>
