      <title>Unified criteria for crystallization in hard-core lattice systems with applications to polyomino fluids and chiral mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified extension of two sets of criteria for high-fugacity crystallization in hard-core lattice systems developed previously by Jauslin, Lebowitz, and the author. Our new criterion is formulated in terms of the existence of a volume allocation rule with desirable properties, in analogy to the scoring function constructed in Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture. The proof uses a recent systematic extension of Pirogov--Sinai theory to systems with infinite interactions by Mazel--Stuhl--Suhov. Notably, our result applies to a large class of polyomino models with discrete rotational degrees of freedom and chiral mixtures thereof.</description>

      <title>Bethe ansatz solution to integrable bosonic cube networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two extended Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians representing bosonic networks restricted to the graph of a cube. For both Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that Bethe ansatz methods of solution can be employed after applying a canonical transformation of operators. We provide the resulting Bethe ansatz equations, and corresponding formulae for states and energies of both Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Dimensions: I. $\gamma$-Independent Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for computing universal (in Vogel's sense) quantum dimension formulae for universal multiplets whose associated $sl$, $so$, and $sp$ representations are nonzero. The method uses the relation between $sl$ and $so$ representations given by the vertical-sum operation, and the dual relation between $sl$ and $sp$ representations given by the horizontal-sum operation on the corresponding Young diagrams. The usual quantum dimensions of these three representations, together with subtleties related to the invariance of universal formulae under automorphisms of the $sl$ Dynkin diagram, allow one to determine the $\gamma$-independent factors of a universal quantum dimension (note that $\gamma$ is the only parameter for classical algebras, depending on their rank). Using this approach, we compute the $\gamma$-independent factors for (known) adjoints' universal quantum dimension, and also obtain such a factor in one new case. We discuss how to extend this approach to the $\gamma$-dependent factors in the quantum dimension formulae, and other issues. This is another instance in which calculations purely within the classical algebras predict the answers for the exceptional cases, due to the hidden universality structure of the theory of simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Local measurements and the entanglement transition in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the transition between short-range entangled (SRE) and long-range ordered (and therefore long-range entangled) states of infinite quantum spin chains, which is induced by local measurements. Specifically, we assume that the initial state is in a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phase with local symmetry group $\mathcal{G} = G \times H$, where $G$ is an Abelian subgroup. We show that the on-site measurements of the local $G$-charge on intervals of increasing lengths transform the initial SRE state into a family of states with increasingly long-range correlations. In particular, the post-measurement states cannot be uniformly short-range entangled. In the case where the initial state is obtained from a product state using a quantum cellular automaton, we construct the infinite-volume post-measurement state and exhibit almost local observables that are maximally correlated.</description>

      <title>On the Efimov Effect for Four Particles in Dimension Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Schr\"odinger operator describing four particles in two dimensions, interacting solely through short-range three-body forces, can possess infinitely many bound states. This holds under the assumption that each three-body subsystem has a virtual level at zero energy. Our result establishes an analog of the Efimov effect for such four-particle systems in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>A surprising discrepancy in the regularity of conjugacies between generalized interval exchange transformations and their inverses at freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized interval exchange transformations (GIETs) are semi-conjugate to interval exchange transformations (IETs) when the Rauzy-Veech combinatorics is $\infty$-complete. When this semi-conjugacy is a homeomorphism, a fundamental problem is to understand the regularity of the conjugacy and its inverse. Contrary to the usual expectation that their H\"older regularities degenerate simultaneously, we exhibit a strongly asymmetric behavior. For self-similar IETs of hyperbolic periodic type and a natural one-parameter central family of affine IET deformations obtained via a freezing (zero-temperature) limit, the conjugacy becomes arbitrarily irregular while its inverse remains uniformly H\"older. Using thermodynamic formalism for renormalization and zero-temperature limits, we obtain sharp asymptotics for Hausdorff dimensions of invariant and conformal measures and for the supremal H\"older exponents of the conjugacy and its inverse.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e Universality classes for the maximal amplitude solution of the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish universality for extremal solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Extremal solutions are $N$-soliton solutions that achieve the theoretical maximal amplitude and diverge as $N \to \infty$. We consider extremal solutions with the discrete eigenvalues randomly drawn from sub-exponential distributions, and identify two distinct universality classes, determined by the macroscopic structure of the spectrum: the Painlev\'e--III rogue-wave solution, where the eigenvalues take the form $\lambda_j = v_j + i \mu_j$, and the Painlev\'e--V rogue wave solution, where $\lambda_j = -\zeta \, j + v_j + i \mu_j$, with $0 &lt; \zeta &lt; 1$. (In both cases, $\mu_{j}$ and $v_{j}$ are subexponential random variables.) Universality can then be summarized as follows: independently of the specific distribution of the eigenvalues, the rescaled solutions converge locally to a deterministic profile governed by the Painlev\'e-III equation in the first regime, and the Painlev\'e-V equation in the second. These results demonstrate that the formation of Painlev\'e-type rogue waves is a universal phenomenon robust to randomness.</description>

      <title>Ersatz gravity and black-hole thermodynamics from Manin gauge theory with noncompact gauge group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a three-dimensional Manin gauge theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2;\mathbb R)$ (i.e. Yang-Mills theory, the third-way theory, or the imaginary third-way theory) minimally coupled to Einstein gravity admits a dual interpretation as Einstein gravity with an exotic coupling to a Manin gauge theory, where the roles of dreibein/spin connection and field strength/gauge potential are interchanged. The dual, or ersatz, gravitational metric $\hat g_{\mu\nu}\sim\operatorname{tr}((\star F)_\mu (\star F)_\nu)$ is a classical double copy of the gauge field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$ (as opposed to the usual double copy of the gauge potential $A_\mu$). If matter exclusively couples to $\hat g$ (for example, in a gravitational decoupling limit), then one can formulate black-hole thermodynamics with regards to the ersatz metric. In particular, a black-hole solution for the ersatz metric $\hat g_{\mu\nu}$ (made of Yang-Mills fields) radiates ersatz Hawking radiation and obeys the laws of black-hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong local nondeterminism for stochastic time-fractional slow and fast diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic time-fractional equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ driven by a centered Gaussian noise, involving a Caputo time derivative of order $\beta&gt;0$, a fractional (power) Laplacian of order $\alpha&gt;0$, and a Riemann-Liouville time integral of order $\gamma\ge0$ acting on the noise. The noise is fractional in time (index $H$) and Riesz-type in space (index $\ell$). We derive sharp Dalang-type necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a random field solution across almost full parameter range $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma;H,\ell)$. Under the Dalang-type conditions, we prove sharp variance bounds for temporal and spatial increments, as well as strong local nondeterminism in time in several regimes (two-sided version for $\beta=1$ and for parts of the case $\beta=2$; one-sided version for $0&lt;\beta&lt;2$) and strong local nondeterminism in space for the whole range of parameters. As applications, we derive exact uniform and local moduli of continuity, Chung-type laws of the iterated logarithm, and quantitative bounds on small ball probabilities. Along the way, we obtain sharp asymptotics for the fundamental solution kernels at $0$ and $\infty$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics for Airy wanderer line ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of the Airy wanderer line ensembles, an infinite-parameter family of Brownian Gibbsian line ensembles arising as edge-scaling limits of inhomogeneous models in the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang universality class. These ensembles are governed by sequences of nonnegative parameters that encode the asymptotic slopes of the curves at positive and negative infinity. Our main results characterize the fluctuations around this leading-order behavior and establish functional limit theorems for the ensembles near both ends of the spatial axis.
  We show that, at a macroscopic level, an Airy wanderer line ensemble organizes into groups of finitely many curves sharing a common asymptotic slope. After appropriate centering and scaling, each such group converges to a Dyson Brownian motion whose dimension equals the size of the group. In the case where only finitely many slope parameters are positive, we further prove a curve separation phenomenon: the upper curves follow deterministic parabolic trajectories, while the remaining lower curves remain globally flat and converge to the classical Airy line ensemble.</description>

      <title>Finite energy subspace for time-periodic Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $N$-body Schr\"o\-dinger operators with
  time-periodic short-range pair-potentials we show by a time-dependent commutator method that all channel wave operators
  exist. For $N=2$ we prove asymptotic completeness by a simplified version of the method, recovering Yajima's completeness result \cite{Yaj1} proven by a stationary method.
  We propose a definition of a \emph{finite energy
  subspace}, intuitively consisting of states with `finite asymptotic energy'. This
  geometric notion is used to characterize the \emph{wave operator
  subspace} given as the direct sum of the ranges of the channel wave operators. Thus our main result states that the two subspaces coincide. In turn they coincide for $N= 2$ with the orthogonal subspace of the pure point subspace of
  the monodromy operator (by asymptotic
  completeness). For $N\geq 3$ asymptotic
  completeness for time-periodic short-range potentials remains an open problem. The main result of the paper may in this case potentially serve as an
  intermediate step for proving (or possibly disproving) asymptotic completeness. Another potential ingredient could be a key intermediate result of the paper, asserting that the states orthogonal to the pure point subspace obey a (sharp) \emph{minimal velocity bound}. Thus it remains an open problem possibly to derive a good maximal velocity bound for $N\geq 3$. Our results apply to $N$-body systems of particles in a time-periodic external electric field with time-mean equal to zero, for example the AC-Stark model.</description>

Abstract: We give a physical interpretation for the analytic continuation of the partition function of superconformal SU$(2)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory on the four-sphere to all values of the Yang-Mills coupling. We show that a well-motivated 2d construction associates two-dimensional unstable instantons to the 4d complex saddles which appear as singularities in the integrand of the supersymmetric localization expression. The construction is based on the chiral algebra subsector, and aligns with the alternative Higgs branch localization.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>The weak and strong disorder regimes in the continuous random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative analysis of the weak- and strong-disorder regimes of the continuous random-field Ising model using the distributional zeta-function method. By performing the quenched-disorder average at the level of the effective action, we derive exact quadratic and interaction terms. In the weak-disorder limit, we show that the infrared structure of the two-point correlation functions yields a decomposition of the physical field into correlated components with distinct scaling dimensions. This mechanism exhibits the characteristic $1/p^4$ behavior, which shifts the upper critical dimension to $d_c^{+}=6$. The universal critical behavior of the RFIM near this dimension is governed by a minimal infrared effective action. In the strong-disorder regime, we obtain an exact diagonal quadratic action with a discrete spectrum of massive modes. Here, the absence of massless modes implies the absence of conventional criticality. The resulting spectral representation of correlation functions converges rapidly and remains well controlled in the infrared regime.</description>

      <title>The Ising magnetisation field and the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a natural coupling between the continuum Gaussian free field (GFF) and the critical Ising magnetisation field (IMF) in a planar domain. In fact, we show that two independent IMFs with $+$ boundary conditions and two independent IMFs with free boundary conditions are a deterministic function of a single instance of the GFF together with a sequence of independent coin flips. This construction should be seen as an extension of the bosonisation phenomenon, and to the best of our knowledge its existence has not been predicted before.
  We arrive at our main result in the continuum by studying novel discrete structures. Our starting point is a coupling resembling the Edwards-Sokal coupling between the Ising model and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster model, though with role of the latter played by a different percolation model obtained from the double random current model. By taking a scaling limit of the coupling at criticality, we obtain a continuum Edwards-Sokal-like representation of the IMFs in terms of certain two-valued sets of the GFF introduced by Aru, Sep\'ulveda and Werner.</description>

      <title>Excursion decomposition of the XOR-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the excursion decomposition of the two-dimensional critical XOR-Ising model with either $+$ or free boundary conditions. In the first part, we construct the decomposition directly in the continuum. This construction relies on the identification of the XOR-Ising field with the cosine or sine of a Gaussian free field (GFF) $\phi$ multiplied by $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and is obtained by an appropriate exploration of two-valued level sets of the GFF. More generally, the same construction applies to the fields $:\! \cos(\alpha \phi) \!:$ and $:\! \sin(\alpha \phi) \!:$ for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$.
  In the second part, we show that the continuum excursion decomposition arises as the scaling limit of the double random current decomposition of the critical XOR-Ising model on the square lattice. To this end, we exploit the rich Markovian structure of the discrete decomposition and strengthen the convergence of the double random current height function to the continuum GFF by establishing joint convergence with its cosine and sine. We conjecture that for $\alpha \in [1/2,\sqrt{3}/2)$ the continuum excursion decompositions arise as the scaling limit of those of the Ashkin-Teller polarisation field along its critical line.</description>

      <title>Monge-Ampere Geometry and Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to Monge-Ampere geometry based on techniques from higher symplectic geometry. Our work is motivated by the application of Monge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an elliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear partial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the rate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to understand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation via an associated (higher) Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle to the configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher) Monge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle together with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The signatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity and rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a physical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their gradients. We show explicity, in the case of two-dimensional flows, how topological information can be derived from the Monge-Ampere geometry of the Lagrangian submanifold. We also demonstrate how certain solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as Hill's spherical vortex and an integrable case of Arnol'd-Beltrami-Childress flow, have symmetries that facilitate a formulation of these solutions from the perspective of (higher) symplectic reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we obtain the exact solution of quantum integrable system associated with the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$, both for periodic and for generic open boundary conditions. By means of the fusion technique we derive a closed set of operator identities among the fused transfer matrices. These identities allow us to determine the complete energy spectrum and the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations of the model. Our approach furnishes a systematic framework for studying the spectra of quantum integrable models based on Lie superalgebras, in particular when the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken. The derivation of the Bethe states from the exact spectrum is also addressed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Bogoliubov approximation for the many-body quantum dynamics of weakly interacting Bose gases and establish a uniform-in-time validity of the Bogoliubov theory. The proof relies on a detailed analysis of the dispersive behavior of the symplectic Bogoliubov dynamics, which allows for a rigorous derivation of the Bogoliubov theory as an effective description of quantum fluctuations around the Bose-Einstein condensate on all time scales.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Theory of Surface Elasticity and Anelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we formulate a geometric theory of elasticity and anelasticity for bodies containing material surfaces with their own elastic energies and distributed surface eigenstrains. Bulk elasticity is written in the language of Riemannian geometry, and the framework is extended to material surfaces by using the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds. Within this setting, surface kinematics, surface strain measures, surface material metric, and the induced second fundamental form follow naturally from the embedding of the material surface in the material manifold. The classical theory of surface elasticity of Gurtin and Murdoch (1975) is revisited and reformulated in this geometric framework, and then extended to anelastic bodies with anelastic material surfaces. Constitutive equations for isotropic and anisotropic material surfaces are formulated systematically, and bulk and surface anelasticity are introduced by replacing the elastic metrics with their anelastic counterparts. The balance laws are derived variationally using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. These include the bulk balance of linear momentum together with the surface balance of linear momentum, whose normal component gives a generalized Laplace's law. As an application, we obtain the complete solution for a spherical incompressible isotropic solid ball containing a cavity filled with a compressible hyperelastic fluid, where the cavity boundary is an anelastic material surface with distributed surface eigenstrains. The analytical and numerical results quantify the effects of surface and fluid eigenstrains on the pressure-stretch response and residual stress.</description>

      <title>1-stable fluctuations in branching Brownian motion at critical temperature II: general functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu_t$ denote the critical derivative Gibbs measure of branching Brownian motion at time $t$. It has been proved by Madaule (Stochastic Process. Appl. 126 (2016), no. 2, 470--502) and Maillard and Zeitouni (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat. 52 (2016), no. 3, 1144--1160) that $\mu_t$ converges weakly to the random measure $Z_\infty \sqrt{2/\pi} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} \boldsymbol 1_{x &gt;0} d x$, where $Z_\infty$ is the limit of the derivative martingale. In this paper, we are interested in the fluctuations that occur in this convergence and prove for a large class of functions $F$ that \begin{align*}
  \sqrt{t} \left(
  \int_{\mathbb R} F d \mu_t
  - Z_\infty \int_0^\infty F(x) \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} d x
  - \frac{c(F) \log t}{\sqrt{t}} Z_\infty \right)
  \to S(F), \end{align*} in law, as $t\to\infty$, where $c(F)$ is a constant depending on $F$ and, given $Z_\infty$, $S(F)$ has an explicit 1-stable distribution. Moreover, we extend this result to a functional convergence, and we identify precisely the particles responsible for the fluctuations. In particular, this proves the following result for the critical additive martingale $(W_t)_{t\geq 0}$: \[ \sqrt{t} \left( \sqrt{t} W_t - \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} Z_\infty \right) \xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{} C Z_\infty, \quad \text{in law}, \] where here $C$ is a Cauchy variable independent of $Z_\infty$, confirming a conjecture by Mueller and Munier (Phys. Rev. E 90 (2014), 042143) in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Rigidity Theorems for Asymptotically Euclidean $Q$-singular Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove some rigidity theorems associated to $Q$-curvature analysis on asymptotically Euclidean (AE) manifolds, which are inspired by the analysis of conservation principles within fourth order gravitational theories. A central object in this analysis is a notion of fourth order energy, previously analysed by the authors, which is subject to a positive energy theorem. We show that this energy can be more geometrically rewritten in terms of a fourth order analogue to the Ricci tensor, which we denote by $J_g$. This allows us to prove that Yamabe positive $J$-flat AE manifolds must be isometric to Euclidean space. As a by product, we prove that this $J$-tensor provides a geometric control for the optimal decay rates at infinity. This last result reinforces the analogy of $J$ as a fourth order analogue to the Ricci tensor.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic-Quantum Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces several new classes of mathematical structures that have close connections with physics and with the theory of dynamical systems. The most general of these structures, called indivisible stochastic processes, collectively encompass many important kinds of stochastic processes, including Markov chains and random dynamical systems. This paper then states and proves a new theorem that establishes a precise correspondence between any indivisible stochastic process and a unitarily evolving quantum system. This theorem therefore leads to a new formulation of quantum theory, alongside the Hilbert-space, path-integral, and quasi-probability formulations. The theorem also provides a first-principles explanation for why quantum systems are based on the complex numbers, Hilbert spaces, linear-unitary time evolution, and the Born rule. In addition, the theorem suggests that by selecting a suitable Hilbert space, together with an appropriate choice of unitary evolution, one can simulate any indivisible stochastic process on a quantum computer, thereby potentially opening up an extensive set of novel applications for quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed two kinds of edge contractions for the affine super Yangian and a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to the universal enveloping algebra of a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$. In this article, we show that these two edge contractions commute with each other. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to some centralizer algebras of the universal enveloping algebra of $W$-superalgebras of type $A$. Using the edge contraction, we also show the compatibility of the coproduct for the affine super Yangian with the parabolic induction for a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$ in some special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a functional calculus which allows one to apply functions to the matrix anti-commutator/commutator operator. The calculus is introduced in a straightforward manner if the operators act on symmetric matrices, and it leads to a coordinate-free version of Daleckii--Krein formula. In this sense, the proposed calculus provides symbolic formulae for the derivatives of matrix-valued functions that are explicit and easy to use. We discuss several applications of the newly introduced calculus in continuum mechanics (Hencky logarithmic strain, objective rates, spin tensors, viscoelastic fluids) and in the theory of partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the search of a target with a given spatial distribution in a finite one-dimensional domain. The searcher follows Brownian dynamics and is always reset to its initial position when reaching the boundaries of the domain (boundary resetting). In addition, the searcher may be reset to its initial position from any internal point of the domain (bulk resetting). Specifically, we look for the optimal strategy for bulk resetting, i.e., the spatially dependent bulk resetting rate that minimizes the average search time. The best search strategy exhibits a second-order transition from vanishing to nonvanishing bulk resetting when varying the target distribution. The obtained mathematical criteria are further analyzed for different monoparametric families of distributions, which sheds light on the properties that control the optimal strategy for bulk resetting. Our work paves new research lines in the study of search processes, emphasizing the relevance of the target distribution for optimal search strategies, and identifies a successful framework to address these questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.</description>

Abstract: Circular photon orbits have become an attractive topic in recent years. They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties. The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L021501}{Phys. Rev. D \textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).</description>

      <title>Toward the noncommutative minimal model program for Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative minimal model program, as proposed by Halpern-Leistner, for Fano varieties. We construct lifts of Iritani's quantum cohomology central charge in the following examples: Grassmannians, smooth quadrics, and smooth cubic threefolds and fourfolds. Moreover, we verify that these lifted paths are quasi-convergent and give rise to the expected semiorthogonal decompositions of the bounded derived category. We also construct geometric stability conditions in the examples above and observe that, after suitable isomonodromic deformation of the quantum cohomology central charge, the quasi-convergent paths for Grassmannians and quadrics can be chosen to start in the geometric region.</description>

      <title>Schroedinger's principle eliminates the EPR-locality paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a principle, implicitly contained in Schroedinger's paper (Schr35), which allows a proof of the non-existence of the EPR-locality paradox in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The paradox is shown to be well-posed already in the simplest example of an entangled state of two spins one-half, independently of the (well-taken) objections by Araki and Yanase that the measurement of spin is not a local measurement. We assume that any measurement results in the collapse of the wave-packet.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation with magnetic potential on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we shall investigate the Nonlinear Magnetic Schr\"odinger Equation on noncompact metric graphs, focusing on the existence of ground states. We prove that the magnetic Hamiltonian is variationally equivalent to a non-magnetic operator with additional repulsive potentials supported on the graph's cycles. This effective potential is strictly determined by the Aharonov-Bohm flux through the topological loops. Leveraging this reduction, we extend classical existence criteria to the magnetic setting. As a key application, we characterize the ground state structure on the tadpole graph, revealing a mass-dependent phase transition. The ground states exist for sufficiently small repulsion in an intermediate regime of masses while sufficiently strong flux prevents the formation of ground states.</description>

      <title>The Small-Dispersion Limit of the Intermediate Long Wave Equation via Semiclassical Soliton Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>
