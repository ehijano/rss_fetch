      <title>Wavelet analysis of possible association between sunspot number and rainfall over Kerala, India: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global attention has been focused on extreme climatic changes. This paper investigates the relationship between different phases of solar activity and extreme precipitation events in Kerala, India. Sunspot number and rainfall data were analysed over 122 years (1901-2022) on an annual scale. A negative correlation was observed in the winter and post-monsoon seasons, while positive correlations were seen in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, all of which were statistically significant. Using cross-wavelet transform, the temporal relationship between sunspot number and rainfall values was investigated, revealing significant cross-power at an 8-12 year scale across all seasons. Wavelet coherence between the two data sets demonstrated significant correlation at the 2-4 and 4-8 year scales throughout the four seasons. The results show that the seasonal rainfall over Kerala is related to solar activity. The solar phases of Solar Cycles 14-24 were determined for all seasons, and the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall were identified. It was observed that the descending phase had an impact on excess rainfall events during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, while the ascending phase notably affected the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study specifically examined the different magnetic polarities of sunspots in alternating solar cycles, focusing on even and odd cycles. It was found that extreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings are presented for the first time and may offer new perspectives on how different phases affect rainfall. This study suggests a physical link between solar activity and extreme precipitation in Kerala, which could increase predictability.</description>

      <title>Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of $\sim 100$ times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.</description>

      <title>Solar activity and extreme rainfall over Kerala, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala, India. Kerala receives minimum and maximum rainfall during winter and monsoon seasons. Sunspot number, F10.7 Index, and cosmic ray intensity are the solar indices considered, and their variations with rainfall are studied over 57 years (1965-2021), i.e., starting from Solar Cycle 20. Correlative studies are performed for each solar cycle, and correlation coefficients are calculated. We find that rainfall in Kerala is correlated with sunspot activity but with varying degrees of significance. During Solar Cycle 21, rainfall and solar activity are correlated with high significance during both winter and monsoon seasons. The variation of different solar indices with rainfall is studied. The winter season showed a better link between the sun and rainfall than the monsoon season. The years with rainfall surplus and deficiency are calculated and compared with the solar indices. {We find that the years with rainfall excess and deficit mainly occur in the years around solar maximum or minimum (within $\pm$2 years).} We hypothesize a physical relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala that contributes to their predictability.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>
