      <title>Dark Secrets of Baryons: Illuminating Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered numerous bright galaxies at high redshifts ($z\approx$ 10 -- 14). Many astrophysical models and beyond the Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark matter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the JWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress structure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on the UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model designed to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter space. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section $\propto v^{-2}$ velocity dependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of $\sim$ 1 -- 500 MeV. For other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-4}$, and DM-electron scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-2},\,v^{-4}$), our limits are competitive with those obtained from other cosmological observables. Our study highlights the potential of JWST observations as a novel and powerful probe of non-gravitational interactions of DM.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Daisy Chain: Running and the 3D EFT View of Supercooled Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have recently observed a stochastic gravitational wave background at nano-Hertz frequencies. This raises the question whether the signal can be of primordial origin. Supercooled first-order phase transitions are among the few early Universe scenarios that can successfully explain it. To further scrutinise this possibility, a precise theoretical understanding of the dynamics of the phase transition is required. Here we perform such an analysis for a dark sector with an Abelian Higgs model in the conformal limit, which is known to admit large supercooling. We compare simple analytic parametrisations of the bounce action, one-loop finite temperature calculations including Daisy resummation, and results of a dimensionally reduced (3D) effective theory including up to two-loop corrections using the DRalgo framework. Consistent renormalisation group evolution (RGE) of the couplings is essential for a meaningful interpretation of the results. We find that the 3D EFT with consistent expansion in the 4D parameters gives a significantly reduced scale dependence of the phase transition parameters. With a suitable choice of RGE scale, the 4D high temperature expanded effective potential yields results consistent with the 3D calculations, while the analytic parametrisation deviates significantly in the limit of large supercooling.</description>

      <title>Semi-visible emerging jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of dark-shower signatures in Standard Model extensions featuring Hidden Valleys or dark sectors coupled through an s-channel mediator. In this framework, unstable dark pions appear as long-lived particles (LLPs), with their lifetimes treated as free parameters. The resulting signatures, which we term semi-visible emerging jets (SVEJ), continuously interpolate between the established semi-visible and emerging jet regimes. We outline an analysis strategy optimized for dark pion lifetimes of order $\mathcal{O}(10)$ mm, and reinterpret existing LLP searches targeting lifetimes of $\mathcal{O}(100)$-$\mathcal{O}(1000)$ mm. Our proposed SVEJ search, exploiting the current ATLAS emerging-jet trigger, achieves sensitivity to cross sections of $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ fb for lifetimes around $\mathcal{O}(10)$ mm. Finally, we advocate a more detailed study, including hadronization uncertainties and detector-level effects.</description>

      <title>A Consistent Path Integral Approach to Higher Derivative Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Quantum Field Theory version of the higher derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator. We quantize canonically this system and construct its Fock space, as well as study its path integral. We demonstrate that the inclusion of canonical coordinates in the path integral necessarily introduces a new field, a Lagrange multiplier, which is essential for the consistent application of these coordinates in the canonical quantization framework. Finally, we analyze the improved ultraviolet convergence of the Green functions that this theory exhibits in the presence of an interaction.</description>

      <title>Studying the thermoelectric properties of an anisotropic QGP medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied how the thermoelectric properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) are affected by a weak-momentum anisotropy arising from the asymptotic expansion of matter in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The highly energetic medium produced in such collisions exhibits a notable temperature difference between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient induces an electric field whose magnitude per unit temperature gradient, in the limit of vanishing electric current, defines the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. We have calculated the Seebeck coefficient for both individual quark flavors and the entire QGP medium in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory framework. The partonic interactions are incorporated through their effective thermal masses within the quasiparticle model for an anisotropic QGP medium. We have observed that the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the entire QGP medium increases in the presence of expansion-induced anisotropy, indicating a stronger induced electric field in the anisotropic medium compared to the isotropic case. Given that an increase in the Seebeck coefficient may lead to observable signatures such as charge asymmetries in particle distributions and to modifications in the transport behavior of the QGP, these results may provide useful input for future phenomenological studies investigating the internal structure and phase properties of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Updated flexible global parametrization of generalized parton distributions from elastic and deep inelastic inclusive scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An updated flexible parametrization of the generalized parton distributions in the quark, antiquark and gluon sectors is presented using constraints from high precision electron nucleon deep inelastic scattering data, as well as from the $u$, $d$ quark and gluonic contributions to the nucleon electromagnetic elastic form factors. The latter include recently updated lattice QCD moment calculations. The generalized parton distributions in the vector sector are $H$ and $E$. We rigorously constrain the partonic components, $H_{u_v}$, $H_{d_v}$, $H_{\bar{u}}$, $H_{\bar{d}}$, $H_{\bar{s}}$ and $H_{g}$, and the analogous quantities for $E$, with proper uncertainty quantification. These distributions obey leading order perturbative QCD evolution equations in $\alpha_S$. Parametric forms at the initial scale, $Q_o^2 = 0.58$ $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, for both quarks and gluon distributions are presented as a function of the relevant kinematic variables, namely, the parton momentum fraction, $x$, the skewness, $\xi$, and the invariant, $t$. We also present the Compton form factors entering the deeply virtual Compton scattering process in the kinematic regimes for both fixed target and electron-ion collider settings.</description>

      <title>Filling the Gap: Hunting for Vector Bosons at the MUonE Experiment with Displaced Decay Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming MUonE experiment aims to precisely measure the running of the fine structure constant via elastic muon-electron scattering, to shed light on the current tension in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In addition to its primary function as a precision experiment, MUonE also offers a unique testing ground to probe long-lived vector bosons. Such vector bosons can be produced via $\mu e \to \mu e V$ or $\mu N \to \mu N V$ scattering and decay into an electron/positron pair a few centimeters away from the interaction point. With its high-resolution tracking system and unique geometric design, MUonE is well-suited to reconstruct displaced vertices close to the target, allowing it to probe parameter space previously unattainable at colliders and longer-baseline beam dump experiments. We present a comprehensive study of the discovery potential of BSM vector boson mediators at the MUonE experiment. We show that MUonE can fill the long-standing gap in the parameter space of vector boson mediators with masses up to around 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking in accelerating and rotating frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in accelerating and rotating frames using low-energy effective models. By analyzing the chiral condensate in Rindler coordinates, we show that different renormalization schemes lead to distinct conclusions in accelerating frame: the scheme with subtracting divergences in Rindler vacuum supports an acceleration-independent critical temperatures, while the other scheme with subtracting divergences in Minkowski vacuum suggests enhanced critical temperature. We further investigate system with both rotation and acceleration. We find that the critical acceleration (see definition in Section V) for chiral symmetry restoration decreases with angular velocity, indicating cooperative effects from acceleration-induced thermalization and rotation-induced effective chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction-like Noise Mitigation for Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.</description>

      <title>Test of the GENIE neutrino event generator against ${}^{16}$O $(e,e'p)$ data: Reduced cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced cross section of the semiexclusive $(l,l'p)$ lepton scat tering process irrespective of the type of interaction is determined mainly by bound nucleon momentum distribution in target and nucleon final state interaction with residual nucleus. These cross sections can be identified with distorted nuclear spectral functions and therefore are similar up to Coulomb c orrections for neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei. In this article we exploit this similarity and use data with precise kinematics and large statistics for semiexclusive electron scattering on oxygen target to test models employed in the GENIE neutrino event generator. We find that these models can not reproduce well the measured reduced cross sections in all allowed kinematic region and the GENIE event generator needs to better describe both the nuclear ground states and nucleon final state interaction. The approach presented in this paper provides a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear models of quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event generators.</description>

      <title>Stellar-like Galactic center excess challenges particle dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center (GC) is potentially hosting the largest indirect signal from particle dark matter (DM), which in many well-motivated models would produce gamma rays as their final states. However, this region has often been dismissed for DM studies because of the evidence for an unexpected gamma-ray component over astrophysical backgrounds at GeV energies, firstly discovered in the data of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the so-called Galactic Center Excess (GCE). While this was initially considered to hint at GeV thermal relics, recent work supports a GCE interpretation in terms of a stellar population of millisecond pulsar-like sources in the Galactic bulge. Building on this preference, we re-evaluate the GC as a powerful target for indirect DM searches via gamma rays. This is achieved by combining adaptive template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods to assess the role of sub-threshold point sources in the observed \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray counts, while minimizing the mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission backgrounds. In a fully self-consistent way, the gamma-ray data are fitted with a mixed model comprising a DM signal and a stellar bulge, both potentially contributing to the GCE. The space left for signals from weak-scale DM particle annihilations is quantified by extracting 95\% C.L. upper limits on the annihilation cross section, which, depending on the DM density profile, result in stringent limits for masses $\lesssim 300$ GeV. The robustness of our results is supported by tests on simulated data.</description>

      <title>Correlated PQCD Analysis of the Semileptonic Decays $\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and the Nonleptonic Decays $ \overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\pi^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified analysis of $\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and $\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\pi^-$ decays using the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The $B \to D^{(*)}$ transition form factors are calculated at low $q^2$ and extrapolated to the high-$q^2$ region using the latest lattice QCD results via a model-independent $z$-expansion. This hybrid method provides a precise form factor description across the full kinematic range. We then predict the branching fractions and the lepton flavor universality ratios $R(D) = 0.336^{+0.014}_{-0.013}$ and $R(D^*) = 0.271^{+0.010}_{-0.010}$, which are consistent with the latest experimental averages. Furthermore, we perform a correlated study of the nonleptonic $ \overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\pi^-$ decays, calculating both factorizable and nonfactorizable amplitudes. To reduce hadronic uncertainties, we introduce and calculate the differential ratio $R^{(*)}_{\pi/\ell}(q^2)$, defined between nonleptonic and semileptonic decay rates, providing a sensitive test of factorization and possible new physics effects. The predictions presented here can be directly tested in ongoing Belle II and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>CP asymmetry factor in decays at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in the conventional equilibrium approach to leptogenesis the complete leading order prediction for the CP asymmetry factor in finite-temperature decays involving Majorana neutrinos. As thermal effects are generally not negligible, the knowledge of the high temperature behavior of the underlying particle physics model, in particular that of mass generation, is required for reliable estimates of matter-antimatter asymmetry through the mechanism of leptogenesis. We present all necessary information needed to obtain the full one-loop evaluation for the thermal CP asymmetry factors for the processes $N_i\to \phi + L$ and $\phi \to N_i+L$ at temperatures where they are kinematically allowed. We present a numerical comparison with previous formulae given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Probing $J/\psi$ Production Mechanisms in Proton-Proton Collisions at SPD/NICA Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate inclusive $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions at tens of GeV $\sqrt{s}$ energy, relevant for forthcoming measurements with the Spin Physics Detector (SPD) at NICA. Simulations are performed using the PEGASUS event generator with transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) gluon densities, comparing the recent KMR-based KL$'2025$ and CCFM-based LLM$'2024$ parametrizations. Differential cross sections in rapidity and transverse momentum exhibit smooth, stable behavior under renormalization-scale variation, while factorization-scale dependence exposes limitations of the LLM$'2024$ set at low scales in contrast to KL$'2025$. Normalized $p_T$ spectra reveal distinct hardening patterns linked to the underlying gluon $k_T$ broadening in each model. The relative contributions of color-singlet and color-octet channels are also quantified, demonstrating the dominance of color-octet mechanisms in the SPD energy regime. These results provide the first detailed assessment of quarkonium production sensitivity to gluon TMDs near threshold, offering timely theoretical guidance for upcoming $J/\psi$ measurements at SPD/NICA.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Discovery Reach for a 95 GeV Scalar in Future $e^+e^-$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed indications for a new scalar resonance with a mass around 95\,GeV, initially reported by LEP and supported by CMS and ATLAS in di-photon, $\tau \tau$, and $W^+ W^-$ channels, motivate exploring its discovery potential at future electron-positron colliders. This study focuses on the production of the new scalar ($S$) via $e^+ e^- \rightarrow ZS $ with $Z \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^- $ and $S \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ and optimizes the signal recognition using the recoil-mass method. By employing deep neural networks for signal-background discrimination, we demonstrate that a 95\,GeV scalar, mixing with the Standard Model Higgs by an angle of $\sim$0.1, can be observed with a 5$\sigma$ significance at $\sqrt{s}$ = 250\,GeV or 200\,GeV with 5~ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.</description>

      <title>Oscillon decay via parametric resonance: the case of three-point scalar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decay dynamics of oscillons through interactions with an external scalar field. To examine how robust the decay dynamics of oscillons via parametric resonance we previously found in Li et al. 2025 are to the specific form of the coupling, we extend the analysis to include a three-point interaction $g_3\phi\chi^2$. We compute the Floquet exponents of the external field $\chi$ under an oscillating oscillon background and analyze how the instability bands depend on the coupling constants and the oscillon shapes. Numerical simulations of the two-field system show that, similar to the four-point case, the parametric resonance may cease before the oscillon is destroyed, leaving a smaller oscillon that decays only perturbatively. This indicates that the partial decay of oscillons through parametric resonance is a generic phenomenon of oscillon-scalar couplings, qualitatively insensitive to the specific interaction form, while the shape of instability bands, parameter dependence, and the precise critical oscillon energies depend on the specific coupling. Our findings provide further insights into the decay dynamics of oscillons and their potential role in the post-inflationary reheating process.</description>

      <title>Scalar molecules $\eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$ and $\eta _{c}B_{c}^{+} $ with asymmetric quark contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic scalar molecules $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ with asymmetric quark contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c} \overline{b}$ are explored by means of the QCD sum rule method. Their masses and current couplings are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The obtained results show that they are strong-interaction unstable particles and transform to ordinary mesons' pairs. The molecule $\mathcal{M} _{b}$ dissociates through the process $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{b}}\to \eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The decays $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are dominant modes for the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{c}$. The full decay widths of the molecules $\mathcal{ M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ are estimated using these decay channels, as well as ones generated by the annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ and $c \overline{c}$ quarks in $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$, respectively. The QCD three-point sum rule method is employed to find partial widths all of these channels. This approach is required to evaluate the strong couplings at the molecule-meson-meson vertices under consideration. The mass $m=(15728 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_b] =(93 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{b}$, and $ \widetilde{m}=(9712 \pm 72)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_c]=(70 \pm 10)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{c} $ offer valuable guidance for experimental searches at existing facilities.</description>

      <title>Two-loop form factors for Dark Matter annihilation to colored Standard Model particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a UV-complete model in which the dark matter (DM) particle interacts with gluons through a colored scalar mediator. This framework provides a phenomenologically viable scenario testable at hadron colliders. While mono-jet signatures are relevant for collider searches, zero-jet processes correspond to complete annihilation of Standard Model (SM) particles into DM, contributing to the relic density. In this work, we study dark matter annihilation into SM colored particles, which in our model arises at leading order from loop-induced processes. We compute the relevant two-loop QCD amplitudes for both gluon and quark channels in dark matter production or annihilation. The amplitudes are decomposed into scalar form factors using the projector technique. Using integration-by-parts (IBP) identities, we obtain analytical expressions for the form factors in terms of master integrals. Ultraviolet divergences are removed via counterterm renormalization, yielding UV-finite results. These results would enable predictions for dark matter production or annihilation into SM colored particles at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the bimetric formalism, we compute the production and emission rates of light spin-2 particles in non-degenerate stellar interiors through photoproduction and bremsstrahlung processes, including the effects of plasma screening. By comparing the resulting energy-loss rates with observational limits on stellar cooling, we derive bounds on the coupling strength and mass of the spin-2 particle. Assuming these particles are the dark matter of the Universe, the obtained constraints are competitive with existing astrophysical and cosmological limits, excluding a wide region of parameter space in the mass range 5-30 eV.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of ringdown models calibrated to numerical relativity simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ''ringdown'' stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe black hole dynamics. However, ringdown models are known to be accurate only in the late-time, stationary regime. A key open problem in the field is to understand if these models are robust when extrapolated to earlier times, and if they can faithfully recover a larger portion of the signal. We address this question through a systematic time-domain calculation of the mismatch between non-precessing, quasi-circular ringdown models parameterised by the progenitor binary's degrees of freedom and full numerical relativity inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) simulation catalog. For the best-performing models, the mismatch is typically in the range $[10^{-6}, 10^{-4}]$ for the $(\ell,|m|)= (2,2)$ harmonic, and $[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ for higher-order modes. Our findings inform ongoing observational searches for quasinormal modes, and underscore the need for improved modeling of higher-order modes to meet the sensitivity requirements of future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of the non-perturbative formulation of superstring theory. In this paper, in string geometry theory, we identify perturbative heterotic vacua, which include general heterotic backgrounds. From fluctuations around these vacua, we derive the path-integrals of heterotic perturbative superstrings on the backgrounds up to any order.</description>

      <title>Impact of QCD Energy Evolution on Observables in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the inclusion of energy dependence as dictated by quantum chromodynamic (QCD) small-$x$ evolution equations affects key observables in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we incorporate JIMWLK evolution into the IP-Glasma framework, which serves as the initial condition for a simulation pipeline that includes viscous relativistic hydrodynamics and a hadronic afterburner. This approach enables a consistent modeling of highly energetic nuclei across varying Bjorken-$x$ values, which are relevant for different collision energies and rapidity regions. In comparison to the standard IP-Glasma setup without small-$x$ evolution, we observe pronounced changes in particle multiplicities and spectral distributions, especially in smaller systems and at the highest available energies. We further explore effects on anisotropic flow observables and correlations between mean transverse momentum and elliptic flow. Our findings underscore the critical role of nonlinear QCD evolution in accurately modeling the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, as well as its implications for extracting transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>The Trace Anomaly at Neutron Star Centers: Minimum or Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</description>

Abstract: We study the sensitivity to longitudinal vector boson scattering at a 27, 50 and 100 TeV $pp$ collider using events containing two leptonically-decaying same-electric-charge $W$ bosons produced in association with two jets. The baseline FCC-hh detector parameterization within the Delphes framework is used under the assumption of fully efficient pile-up mitigation. A tightly constrained phase space with a dijet mass greater than 2 TeV is considered in order to suppress the impact of potential instrumental backgrounds. Based on this setup, the expected sensitivity to the production of longitudinally polarized same-sign $W$ boson pairs is evaluated. Additionally, expected limits are set on doubly charged Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion processes and decaying to same-sign $W$ boson pairs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study Dirac and Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field in the three-flavour case. A theoretical framework developed in \cite{Popov:2019} is extended to the case of three neutrino species, as well as to the Majorana neutrinos case. The closed expression for the Dirac neutrinos flavour and spin oscillations are given. Majorana neutrino oscillations are studied numerically. We show that the probabilities exhibit a complicated interplay of oscillation on magnetic $\mu_\nu B$ and vacuum $\Delta m^2_{ij}/2p$ frequencies. It is also shown that neutrino oscillations in an interstellar magnetic field can modify neutrino fluxes observed in neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Identifying CP Basis Invariants in SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our automated framework that uses ring diagrams for classifying CP basis invariants [Phys. Rev. D 108, 115030 (2023)], this paper broadens the application of the methodology with more extensive examples and a wider scope of theoretical frameworks. Here, we showcase its versatility through detailed analyses of specific operators in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), such as a four-fermion operator at dimension-6 and a Yukawa operator extended up to dimension-2n terms while maintaining a dimension-6 core, as well as in SMEFT with sterile neutrinos up to dimension-7. By integrating the ring-diagram technique with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we have developed a system that not only simplifies the process of identifying basic and joint invariants but also enables the automatic differentiation between CP-even and CP-odd invariants from the lowest orders. Additionally, this work presents a comparison of our results with those derived using the traditional Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and its Plethystic logarithm. While these conventional approaches primarily yield the numerical count of invariants, our framework provides a complete structure of invariants, thereby surpassing the limitations of these traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless or almost massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or for neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</description>

      <title>Exploring twist-3 chiral even generalized parton distributions of light sea quarks in the proton using the light front model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a light-front model of the proton to investigate the twist-3 chiral-even generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of light sea quarks. In this framework, sea quarks are treated as spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) active partons, while the remaining proton constituents are modeled as spin-1 spectators. The light-front momentum wave function, derived from the soft-wall AdS/QCD approach, is fitted to unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) from the CETQ global analysis to constrain the model parameters. To further validate the model, we analyze the sea quark flavor asymmetry through the difference \(\bar{d}(x) - \bar{u}(x)\) and the ratio \(\bar{d}(x)/\bar{u}(x)\), achieving good agreement with known phenomenological trends. Using this fitted distribution, we compute the twist-3 chiral-even GPDs and examine their dependence on the transverse momentum transfer \(\boldsymbol{\Delta_T}\) and the longitudinal momentum fraction \(x\). In addition, we evaluate the twist-3 chiral-even PDF \(g_T(x)\) within this framework. The contribution of sea quarks to the proton's orbital angular momentum is also investigated and compared with existing results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Aspen Open Jets: Unlocking LHC Data for Foundation Models in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are deep learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data which are capable of generalizing to multiple datasets and/or downstream tasks. This work demonstrates how data collected by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider can be useful in pre-training foundation models for HEP. Specifically, we introduce the AspenOpenJets dataset, consisting of approximately 178M high $p_T$ jets derived from CMS 2016 Open Data. We show how pre-training the OmniJet-$\alpha$ foundation model on AspenOpenJets improves performance on generative tasks with significant domain shift: generating boosted top and QCD jets from the simulated JetClass dataset. In addition to demonstrating the power of pre-training of a jet-based foundation model on actual proton-proton collision data, we provide the ML-ready derived AspenOpenJets dataset for further public use.</description>

      <title>Identified Hadron Production in Deeply Inelastic Neutrino-Nucleon Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of identified hadrons in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is sensitive to parton distribution functions and hadron fragmentation functions. Neutrino-induced SIDIS processes probe combinations of these functions different from their charged-lepton-induced counterparts. We compute charged pion production in (anti-)neutrino induced SIDIS up to second order in perturbative QCD and compare our predictions to precise legacy fixed-target data. We demonstrate the high sensitivity of these data on the parametrization of the fragmentation functions and discuss future SIDIS probes at the LHC Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>

      <title>Discriminating Tauphilic Leptoquark Explanations of the $B$ Anomalies via $K\to \pi\nu\bar\nu$ and $B\to K\nu\bar\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leptoquark models are prime candidates for new physics (NP) explanations of the long-standing anomalies in semi-leptonic $B$ decays; $b\to c \tau \bar\nu$ (encoded in $R(D^{(\ast)})$) and $b\to s\ell\bar\ell (\ell=e,\mu)$ transitions. Furthermore, Belle II and NA62 reported weaker-than-expected limits on $B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$ and $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar\nu$, respectively. While the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ and $b\to s\ell \bar\ell$ measurements can be explained with NP contributions at the $O(10\%)$ level, the neutrino channels suggest that the NP effect could be comparable in size to the Standard Model one. In this context, we consider the two types of leptoquark models with minimal sets of the couplings that can best describe the semi-leptonic $B$ anomalies and lead at the same time to effects in the neutrino modes, the singlet-triplet scalar leptoquark model ($S_1+S_3$) and the singlet vector leptoquark model ($U_1$). More specifically, the neutrino channels pose non-trivial constraints on the parameter space, and we find that large effects (i.e., accounting for the current central value) in $B\to K^{(*)}\nu\bar\nu$ are only possible in the $S_1+S_3$ setup, while both models can account for the central value of $K^+\to \pi^+\nu\bar\nu$.</description>

      <title>Searching for gluon saturation effects in the momentum transfer dependence of coherent charmonium electroproduction off nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study for the first time the transverse momentum transfer distributions $d\sigma/dt$ in coherent production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions within the QCD color dipole approach based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This allows us to treat properly the color transparency effects, as well as the higher and leading-twist shadowing corrections associated with the $|Q\bar Q\rangle$ and $|Q\bar QnG\rangle$ Fock components of the photon. While the multi-gluon photon fluctuations represent the dominant source of nuclear shadowing at kinematic regions related to the recent LHC and its future upgrade to LHeC, the upcoming electron-ion collider at RHIC will additionally require the proper incorporation of reduced quark shadowing. The latter effect leads to a significant decrease in the differential cross sections $d\sigma/dt$ compared to standard calculations based on the eikonal form for the dipole-nucleus amplitude. The leading-twist shadowing corrections, corresponding to a non-linear QCD evolution of a partial dipole-nucleus amplitude, reduce substantially charmonium $t$-distributions in the LHeC energy range. We predict a non-monotonic energy dependence of $d\sigma/dt$ suggesting so possible gluon saturation effects with increased onset at larger $t$-values. In addition to shadowing corrections, we study how the color transparency effects affect the shape of $t$-dependent nuclear modification factor. We also briefly discuss several aspects that can modify the charmonium production rate and thus may have a large impact on the search for gluon saturation effects.</description>

      <title>$WWh$ anomalous couplings at one loop from a seesaw variant of radiatively-induced neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the successful measurement of the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider, the determination of whether it corresponds to either the minimal version of the Higgs scalar, provided by the Standard Model, or to some new physics, so far unknown, has become a main objective of the high-energy-physics community. In particular, the investigation of the couplings of this particle with the rest of the Standard-Model field content is a central task. To this aim, in the present paper we consider a variant of the seesaw neutrino-mass-generating mechanism in which the masses of light neutrinos are generated via radiative corrections of the neutrino 2-point function. In this framework, we calculate the contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos to the $WWh$ vertex, at one loop. A set of anomalous couplings, some of them $CP$-even and the others $CP$-odd, emerge from this calculation. We perform numerical estimations of these anomalous couplings by taking into account the role of the $WWh$ vertex in (1) $Wh$ production from $pp$ collisions and (2) in Higgs production by vector-boson fusion, occurring in some lepton collider. Our estimations show that all the generated anomalous couplings are beyond current experimental sensitivity. However, we note that $CP$-conserving anomalous couplings could be as large as $\sim10^{-3}$, which would be near the reach of the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. On the other hand, $CP$-odd effects, amounting to $\sim10^{-4}$, turn out to be well below expectations for the Compact Linear Collider by about 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>CP violation in $K\to\mu^+\mu^-$ with and without time dependence through a tagged analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that using current knowledge of ${\cal B}(K^0_L\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ and $ {\cal B}(K^0_L\to \gamma\gamma)$, one can extract short-distance information from the combined measurement of the time-integrated CP asymmetry, $A_{\rm CP}(K^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)$, and of ${\cal B}(K^0_S\to\mu^+\mu^-)$. We discuss the interplay between this set of observables, and demonstrate that determining ${\rm sign}[A_{\rm CP}(K^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)]$ would eliminate the discrete ambiguity in the Standard Model prediction for ${\cal B}(K^0_L\to\mu^+\mu^-)$. We then move on to feasibility studies within an LHCb-like setup, using both time-integrated and time-dependent information, employing $K^0$ and $\overline K{}^0$ tagging methods. We find that, within an optimistic scenario, the short-distance amplitude, proportional to the CKM parameter combination $|A^2\lambda^5\bar\eta|$, could be constrained by LHCb at the level of about $35\%$ of its Standard Model value, and the discrete ambiguity in ${\cal B}(K^0_L\to\mu^+\mu^-)_{\rm SM}$ could be resolved at more than $3\sigma$ by the end of the high luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media II: Quasi-steady states and miscidynamic flavor evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extended the once-in-a-lifetime encounter (OILE) model to stochastic interactions among neutrinos. As in the original OILE model, the new model reproduces the mean-field behavior of a dense neutrino gas for time $t\lesssim (\mu\gamma)^{-1}$, where $\mu$ measures the strength of the mean-field neutrino self-interaction potential and is proportional to the neutrino density, and the dimensionless "impact parameter" $\gamma$ is a measure of the change in the flavor quantum state of a neutrino during interaction with another neutrino when the wave packets of the two neutrinos overlap. As in the mean-field case, the OILE model with random neutrino velocities experiences kinetic flavor decoherence as the flavor quantum states of the neutrinos diverge from each other. Unlike the mean-field case, however, the OILE model has a "collision term" due to the quantum entanglement among neutrinos. For $\gamma\ll1$, this incoherent effect can drive the neutrinos into a quasi-steady state that is similar to the collective precession mode in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas in the mean-field approximation. Subsequently, the collision term drives the neutrino gas adiabatically through different quasi-steady states and eventually to flavor equilibration. This process is an example of miscidynamic flavor evolution, with the mixing equilibria being the quasi-steady precession states.</description>

      <title>Production of the $ X(3872)$ state via the $B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872)$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work the production of the state $X(3872)$ is estimated via the reaction $B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872)$ through triangle mechanisms described by the sequence $B^0 \to D_s^{(*)+} (\to K^{\ast 0} D^{(*)+} ) \ D^{(*)-} \to K^{\ast 0} \ ( D^{(*)+} D^{(*)-} ) \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872) $. The molecular configuration $(D\bar D^* - c.c. )$ of the $X(3872)$ is considered. By means of the effective Lagrangian approach, the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872))$ is calculated as a function of the strength of the coupling of the charged components $(D^+\bar D^{*-} - c.c. )$ to the $X(3872)$ and compared with experimental data. Besides, employing the decay $B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} \psi (2S)$ as a normalization channel, the ratio of branching fractions $R = \frac{\mathcal{B}( B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} X(3872) )}{\mathcal{B}( B^0 \to K^{\ast 0} \psi (2S) )}\times \frac{\mathcal{B}( X(3872) \to J/\psi \pi^{+} \pi^{-} )}{\mathcal{B}( \psi (2S) \to J/\psi \pi^{+} \pi^{-} )} $ is also estimated. The findings provide another concrete example for the vital role of charged components in achieving a quantitatively correct description of the $X(3872)$.</description>

      <title>Dark matter production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that a simple redefinition of the regularizing parameter in regular black hole (RBH) metrics can preserve the self-similarity of the evaporation process. This implies that a RBH can evaporate completely, mirroring the behavior of its singular counterpart. Consequently, RBHs need not evolve into exotic, unverified remnant states such as horizonless compact objects or wormholes. We then provide a generic framework to study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). As illustrative examples, we explicitly work out the cases of the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric. The formalism can be readily applied to other metrics. RPBH generally exhibits different Hawking temperature and horizon size compared to their singular counterpart, leading to distinct lifetime and mass evolution. We calculate the resulting modified cosmological constraints and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance. This intriguing scenario provides a unified resolution to both the DM problem and the black hole singularity problem, while preserving the standard self-similar evaporation process.</description>

      <title>NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ within the Aivazis--Collins--Olness--Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and $F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$ interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$, $g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD analyses.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the non-Abelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach that incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that both the running coupling and the gluon propagator remain finite at infrared scales and that the latter shows positivity violations that reflects the presence of massless modes. We obtain a simple flux tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, which we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation is a feature of several quantum gravity models in which Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, possibly leading to changes in particle behavior and interactions. In this work, we investigate vacuum Cherenkov radiation, a reaction in which an electron spontaneously emits a photon. This process, forbidden when Lorentz symmetry is unbroken, is a phenomenological consequence of some quantum gravity models. We derive, for the first time, the spectra for the vacuum Cherenkov reaction, and confirm our results numerically. These results can be used to derive limits on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>
