      <title>Real-Time Detection of Robot Failures Using Gaze Dynamics in Collaborative Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting robot failures during collaborative tasks is crucial for maintaining trust in human-robot interactions. This study investigates user gaze behaviour as an indicator of robot failures, utilising machine learning models to distinguish between non-failure and two types of failures: executional and decisional. Eye-tracking data were collected from 26 participants collaborating with a robot on Tangram puzzle-solving tasks. Gaze metrics, such as average gaze shift rates and the probability of gazing at specific areas of interest, were used to train machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, SVM, and CatBoost. The results show that Random Forest achieved 90% accuracy for detecting executional failures and 80% for decisional failures using the first 5 seconds of failure data. Real-time failure detection was evaluated by segmenting gaze data into intervals of 3, 5, and 10 seconds. These findings highlight the potential of gaze dynamics for real-time error detection in human-robot collaboration.</description>

      <title>Serious Play to Encourage Socialization between Unfamiliar Children Facilitated by a LEGO Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socialization is an essential development skill for preschool children. In collaboration with the LEGO Group, we developed Robert Robot, a simplified robot, which enables socialization between children and facilitates shared experiences when meeting for the first time. An exploratory study to observe socialization between preschool children was conducted with 30 respondents in pairs. Additionally, observational data from 212 play sessions with four Robert Robots in the wild were collected. Subsequent analysis found that children have fun as Robert Robot breaks the ice between unfamiliar children. The children relayed audio cues related to the imaginative world of Robert Robot's personalities and mimicked each other as a method of initiating social play and communication with their unfamiliar peers. Furthermore, the study contributes four implications for the design of robots for socialization between children. This chapter provides an example case of serious storytelling using playful interactions engaging children with the character of the robot and the mini-narratives around the build requests.</description>

      <title>Malleable Overview-Detail Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overview-detail design pattern, characterized by an overview of multiple items and a detailed view of a selected item, is ubiquitously implemented across software interfaces. Designers often try to account for all users, but ultimately these interfaces settle on a single form. For instance, an overview map may display hotel prices but omit other user-desired attributes. This research instead explores the malleable overview-detail interface, one that end-users can customize to address individual needs. Our content analysis of overview-detail interfaces uncovered three dimensions of variation: content, composition, and layout, enabling us to develop customization techniques along these dimensions. For content, we developed Fluid Attributes, a set of techniques enabling users to show and hide attributes between views and leverage AI to manipulate, reformat, and generate new attributes. For composition and layout, we provided solutions to compose multiple overviews and detail views and transform between various overview and overview-detail layouts. A user study on our techniques implemented in two design probes revealed that participants produced diverse customizations and unique usage patterns, highlighting the need and broad applicability for malleable overview-detail interfaces.</description>

      <title>The News Says, the Bot Says: How Immigrants and Locals Differ in Chatbot-Facilitated News Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News reading helps individuals stay informed about events and developments in society. Local residents and new immigrants often approach the same news differently, prompting the question of how technology, such as LLM-powered chatbots, can best enhance a reader-oriented news experience. The current paper presents an empirical study involving 144 participants from three groups in Virginia, United States: local residents born and raised there (N=48), Chinese immigrants (N=48), and Vietnamese immigrants (N=48). All participants read local housing news with the assistance of the Copilot chatbot. We collected data on each participant's Q&amp;A interactions with the chatbot, along with their takeaways from news reading. While engaging with the news content, participants in both immigrant groups asked the chatbot fewer analytical questions than the local group. They also demonstrated a greater tendency to rely on the chatbot when formulating practical takeaways. These findings offer insights into technology design that aims to serve diverse news readers.</description>

      <title>Helios 2.0: A Robust, Ultra-Low Power Gesture Recognition System Optimised for Event-Sensor based Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an advance in wearable technology: a mobile-optimized, real-time, ultra-low-power event camera system that enables natural hand gesture control for smart glasses, dramatically improving user experience. While hand gesture recognition in computer vision has advanced significantly, critical challenges remain in creating systems that are intuitive, adaptable across diverse users and environments, and energy-efficient enough for practical wearable applications. Our approach tackles these challenges through carefully selected microgestures: lateral thumb swipes across the index finger (in both directions) and a double pinch between thumb and index fingertips. These human-centered interactions leverage natural hand movements, ensuring intuitive usability without requiring users to learn complex command sequences. To overcome variability in users and environments, we developed a novel simulation methodology that enables comprehensive domain sampling without extensive real-world data collection. Our power-optimised architecture maintains exceptional performance, achieving F1 scores above 80\% on benchmark datasets featuring diverse users and environments. The resulting models operate at just 6-8 mW when exploiting the Qualcomm Snapdragon Hexagon DSP, with our 2-channel implementation exceeding 70\% F1 accuracy and our 6-channel model surpassing 80\% F1 accuracy across all gesture classes in user studies. These results were achieved using only synthetic training data. This improves on the state-of-the-art for F1 accuracy by 20\% with a power reduction 25x when using DSP. This advancement brings deploying ultra-low-power vision systems in wearable devices closer and opens new possibilities for seamless human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Entangled responsibility: an analysis of citizen science communication and scientific citizenship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of citizen science is often referred to as the means of engaging public members in scientific research activities that can advance the reach and impact of technoscience. Despite this, few studies have addressed how human-machine collaborations in a citizen science context enable and constrain scientific citizenship and citizens' epistemic agencies and reconfigure science-citizen relations, including the process of citizens' engagement in scientific knowledge production. The following will address this gap by analysing the human and nonhuman material and discursive engagements in the citizen science project The Sound of Denmark. Doing so contributes to new knowledge on designing more responsible forms of citizen science engagement that advance civic agencies. Key findings emphasise that citizen science development can benefit from diverse fields such as participatory design research and feminist technoscience. Finally, the paper contributes to a broader debate on the formation of epistemic subjects, scientific citizenship, and responsible designing and evaluation of citizen science.

      <title>Sustaining Human Agency, Attending to Its Cost: An Investigation into Generative AI Design for Non-Native Speakers' Language Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems and tools today can generate human-like expressions on behalf of people. It raises the crucial question about how to sustain human agency in AI-mediated communication. We investigated this question in the context of machine translation (MT) assisted conversations. Our participants included 45 dyads. Each dyad consisted of one new immigrant in the United States, who leveraged MT for English information seeking as a non-native speaker, and one local native speaker, who acted as the information provider. Non-native speakers could influence the English production of their message in one of three ways: labeling the quality of MT outputs, regular post-editing without additional hints, or augmented post-editing with LLM-generated hints. Our data revealed a greater exercise of non-native speakers' agency under the two post-editing conditions. This benefit, however, came at a significant cost to the dyadic-level communication performance. We derived insights for MT and other generative AI design from our findings.</description>

      <title>Predicting Volleyball Season Performance Using Pre-Season Wearable Data and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting performance outcomes has the potential to transform training approaches, inform coaching strategies, and deepen our understanding of the factors that contribute to athletic success. Traditional non-automated data analysis in sports are often difficult to scale. To address this gap, this study analyzes factors influencing athletic performance by leveraging passively collected sensor data from smartwatches and ecological momentary assessments (EMA). The study aims to differentiate between 14 collegiate volleyball players who go on to perform well or poorly, using data collected prior to the beginning of the season. This is achieved through an integrated feature set creation approach. The model, validated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, achieved promising predictive performance (F1 score = 0.75). Importantly, by utilizing data collected before the season starts, our approach offers an opportunity for players predicted to perform poorly to improve their projected outcomes through targeted interventions by virtue of daily model predictions. The findings from this study not only demonstrate the potential of machine learning in sports performance prediction but also shed light on key features along with subjective psycho-physiological states that are predictive of, or associated with, athletic success.</description>

      <title>Desirable Unfamiliarity: Insights from Eye Movements on Engagement and Readability of Dictation Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dictation interfaces support efficient text input, but the transcribed text can be hard to read. To understand how users read and review dictated text, we conducted a controlled eye-tracking experiment with 20 participants to compare five dictation interfaces: PLAIN (real-time transcription), AOC (periodic corrections), RAKE (keyword highlights), GP-TSM (grammar-preserving highlights), and SUMMARY (LLM-generated abstraction summary). The study analyzed participants' gaze patterns during their speech composition and reviewing processes. The findings show that during composition, participants spent only 7--11% of their time actively reading, and they favored real-time feedback and avoided distracting interface changes. During reviewing, although SUMMARY introduced unfamiliar words (requiring longer and more frequent fixation), they were easier to read (requiring fewer regressions). Participants preferred SUMMARY for the polished text that preserved fidelity to original meanings. RAKE guided the reading of self-produced text better than GP-TSM. These findings provide new ways to rethink the design of dictation interfaces.</description>

      <title>Privacy Law Enforcement Under Centralized Governance: A Qualitative Analysis of Four Years' Special Privacy Rectification Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, major privacy laws like the GDPR have brought about positive changes. However, challenges remain in enforcing the laws, particularly due to under-resourced regulators facing a large number of potential privacy-violating software applications (apps) and the high costs of investigating them. Since 2019, China has launched a series of privacy enforcement campaigns known as Special Privacy Rectification Campaigns (SPRCs) to address widespread privacy violations in its mobile application (app) ecosystem. Unlike the enforcement of the GDPR, SPRCs are characterized by large-scale privacy reviews and strict sanctions, under the strong control of central authorities. In SPRCs, central government authorities issue administrative orders to mobilize various resources for market-wide privacy reviews of mobile apps. They enforce strict sanctions by requiring privacy-violating apps to rectify issues within a short timeframe or face removal from app stores. While there are a few reports on SPRCs, the effectiveness and potential problems of this campaign-style privacy enforcement approach remain unclear to the community. In this study, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with app-related engineers involved in SPRCs to better understand the campaign-style privacy enforcement. Based on the interviews, we reported our findings on a variety of aspects of SPRCs, such as the processes that app engineers regularly follow to achieve privacy compliance in SPRCs, the challenges they encounter, the solutions they adopt to address these challenges, and the impacts of SPRCs, etc. We found that app engineers face a series of challenges in achieving privacy compliance in their apps...</description>

      <title>Chatbots for Data Collection in Surveys: A Comparison of Four Theory-Based Interview Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys are a widespread method for collecting data at scale, but their rigid structure often limits the depth of qualitative insights obtained. While interviews naturally yield richer responses, they are challenging to conduct across diverse locations and large participant pools. To partially bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of using LLM-based chatbots to support qualitative data collection through interview probes embedded in surveys. We assess four theory-based interview probes: descriptive, idiographic, clarifying, and explanatory. Through a split-plot study design (N=64), we compare the probes' impact on response quality and user experience across three key stages of HCI research: exploration, requirements gathering, and evaluation. Our results show that probes facilitate the collection of high-quality survey data, with specific probes proving effective at different research stages. We contribute practical and methodological implications for using chatbots as research tools to enrich qualitative data collection.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Deliberation: The AI Penalty and the Emergence of a New Deliberative Divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital deliberation has expanded democratic participation, yet challenges remain. This includes processing information at scale, moderating discussions, fact-checking, or attracting people to participate. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer potential solutions, but public perceptions of AI's role in deliberation remain underexplored. Beyond efficiency, democratic deliberation is about voice and recognition. If AI is integrated into deliberation, public trust, acceptance, and willingness to participate may be affected. We conducted a preregistered survey experiment with a representative sample in Germany (n=1850) to examine how information about AI-enabled deliberation influences willingness to participate and perceptions of deliberative quality. Respondents were randomly assigned to treatments that provided them information about deliberative tasks facilitated by either AI or humans. Our findings reveal a significant AI-penalty. Participants were less willing to engage in AI-facilitated deliberation and rated its quality lower than human-led formats. These effects were moderated by individual predispositions. Perceptions of AI's societal benefits and anthropomorphization of AI showed positive interaction effects on people's interest to participate in AI-enabled deliberative formats and positive quality assessments, while AI risk assessments showed negative interactions with information about AI-enabled deliberation. These results suggest AI-enabled deliberation faces substantial public skepticism, potentially even introducing a new deliberative divide. Unlike traditional participation gaps based on education or demographics, this divide is shaped by attitudes toward AI. As democratic engagement increasingly moves online, ensuring AI's role in deliberation does not discourage participation or deepen inequalities will be a key challenge for future research and policy.</description>

      <title>"We're losing our neighborhoods. We're losing our community": A comparative analysis of community discourse in online and offline public spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering from crises, such as hurricanes or wildfires, is a complex process that can take weeks, months, or even decades to overcome. Crises have both acute (immediate) and chronic (long-term) effects on communities. Crisis informatics research often focuses on the immediate response phase of disasters, thereby overlooking the long-term recovery phase, which is critical for understanding the information needs of users undergoing challenges like climate gentrification and housing inequity. We fill this gap by investigating community discourse over eight months following Hurricane Ida in an online neighborhood Facebook group and Town Hall Meetings of a borough in the New York Metropolitan region. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined the use of social media to manage long-term disaster recovery. The findings revealed a significant overlap in topics, underscoring the interconnected nature of online and offline community discourse, and illuminated themes related to the long-term consequences of disasters. We conclude with recommendations aimed at helping designers and government leaders enhance participation across community forums and support recovery in the aftermath of disasters.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration: Safety, Dynamic Ergonomics, and Adaptive Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of collaborative robots into industrial environments has improved productivity, but has also highlighted significant challenges related to operator safety and ergonomics. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception technologies, real-time ergonomic monitoring, and Behaviour Tree (BT)-based adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional methods, which often operate in isolation or statically, our approach combines deep learning models (YOLO11 and SlowOnly), advanced tracking (Unscented Kalman Filter) and dynamic ergonomic assessments (OWAS), offering a modular, scalable and adaptive system. Experimental results show that the framework outperforms previous methods in several aspects: accuracy in detecting postures and actions, adaptivity in managing human-robot interactions, and ability to reduce ergonomic risk through timely robotic interventions. In particular, the visual perception module showed superiority over YOLOv9 and YOLOv8, while real-time ergonomic monitoring eliminated the limitations of static analysis. Adaptive role management, made possible by the Behaviour Tree, provided greater responsiveness than rule-based systems, making the framework suitable for complex industrial scenarios. Our system demonstrated a 92.5\% accuracy in grasping intention recognition and successfully classified ergonomic risks with real-time responsiveness (average latency of 0.57 seconds), enabling timely robotic</description>

      <title>The StudyChat Dataset: Student Dialogues With ChatGPT in an Artificial Intelligence Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread availability of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has significantly impacted education, raising both opportunities and challenges. Students can frequently interact with LLM-powered, interactive learning tools, but their usage patterns need to be analyzed to ensure ethical usage of these tools. To better understand how students interact with LLMs in an academic setting, we introduce \textbf{StudyChat}, a publicly available dataset capturing real-world student interactions with an LLM-powered tutoring chatbot in a semester-long, university-level artificial intelligence (AI) course. We deploy a web application that replicates ChatGPT's core functionalities, and use it to log student interactions with the LLM while working on programming assignments. We collect 1,197 conversations, which we annotate using a dialogue act labeling schema inspired by observed interaction patterns and prior research. Additionally, we analyze these interactions, highlight behavioral trends, and analyze how specific usage patterns relate to course outcomes. \textbf{StudyChat} provides a rich resource for the learning sciences and AI in education communities, enabling further research into the evolving role of LLMs in education.</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Data-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on a kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>AI-native Memory 2.0: Second Me</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08102v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human interaction with the external world fundamentally involves the exchange of personal memory, whether with other individuals, websites, applications, or, in the future, AI agents. A significant portion of this interaction is redundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across different contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials, autofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate this redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly used user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND ME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that retains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By serving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate context-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and interaction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME extends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory parameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning, and adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and intelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like SECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME further represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction with persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems. We have open-sourced the fully localizable deployment system at GitHub: https://github.com/Mindverse/Second-Me.</description>

      <title>OLMD: Orientation-aware Long-term Motion Decoupling for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) mainly stems from the presence of multi-orientational and long-term motions. However, current research overlooks these crucial aspects, significantly impacting accuracy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel CSLR framework: Orientation-aware Long-term Motion Decoupling (OLMD), which efficiently aggregates long-term motions and decouples multi-orientational signals into easily interpretable components. Specifically, our innovative Long-term Motion Aggregation (LMA) module filters out static redundancy while adaptively capturing abundant features of long-term motions. We further enhance orientation awareness by decoupling complex movements into horizontal and vertical components, allowing for motion purification in both orientations. Additionally, two coupling mechanisms are proposed: stage and cross-stage coupling, which together enrich multi-scale features and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Experimentally, OLMD shows SOTA performance on three large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily. Notably, we improved the word error rate (WER) on PHOENIX14 by an absolute 1.6% compared to the previous SOTA</description>

      <title>ICPR 2024 Competition on Rider Intention Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in the vehicle market has led to an alarming increase in road accidents. This underscores the critical importance of enhancing road safety measures, particularly for vulnerable road users like motorcyclists. Hence, we introduce the rider intention prediction (RIP) competition that aims to address challenges in rider safety by proactively predicting maneuvers before they occur, thereby strengthening rider safety. This capability enables the riders to react to the potential incorrect maneuvers flagged by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We collect a new dataset, namely, rider action anticipation dataset (RAAD) for the competition consisting of two tasks: single-view RIP and multi-view RIP. The dataset incorporates a spectrum of traffic conditions and challenging navigational maneuvers on roads with varying lighting conditions. For the competition, we received seventy-five registrations and five team submissions for inference of which we compared the methods of the top three performing teams on both the RIP tasks: one state-space model (Mamba2) and two learning-based approaches (SVM and CNN-LSTM). The results indicate that the state-space model outperformed the other methods across the entire dataset, providing a balanced performance across maneuver classes. The SVM-based RIP method showed the second-best performance when using random sampling and SMOTE. However, the CNN-LSTM method underperformed, primarily due to class imbalance issues, particularly struggling with minority classes. This paper details the proposed RAAD dataset and provides a summary of the submissions for the RIP 2024 competition.</description>

      <title>Exploring Socio-Cultural Challenges and Opportunities in Designing Mental Health Chatbots for Adolescents in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health challenges among Indian adolescents are shaped by unique cultural and systemic barriers, including high social stigma and limited professional support. Through a mixed-methods study involving a survey of 278 adolescents and follow-up interviews with 12 participants, we explore how adolescents perceive mental health challenges and interact with digital tools. Quantitative results highlight low self-stigma but significant social stigma, a preference for text over voice interactions, and low utilization of mental health apps but high smartphone access. Our qualitative findings reveal that while adolescents value privacy, emotional support, and localized content in mental health tools, existing chatbots lack personalization and cultural relevance. These findings inform recommendations for culturally sensitive chatbot design that prioritizes anonymity, tailored support, and localized resources to better meet the needs of adolescents in India. This work advances culturally sensitive chatbot design by centering underrepresented populations, addressing critical gaps in accessibility and support for adolescents in India.</description>

      <title>Generating Robot Constitutions &amp; Benchmarks for Semantic Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Until recently, robotics safety research was predominantly about collision avoidance and hazard reduction in the immediate vicinity of a robot. Since the advent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable of higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions with humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or jail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical contact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making semantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the ASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for evaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot brains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and image generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a framework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel auto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of behavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on behavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and specificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and demonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional actions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written constitutions.

      <title>Evaluating Tenant-Landlord Tensions Using Generative AI on Online Tenant Forums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tenant-landlord relationships exhibit a power asymmetry where landlords' power to evict the tenants at a low-cost results in their dominating status in such relationships. Tenant concerns are thus often unspoken, unresolved, or ignored and this could lead to blatant conflicts as suppressed tenant concerns accumulate. Modern machine learning methods and Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated immense abilities to perform language tasks. In this study, we incorporate Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with GPT-4 to classify Reddit post data scraped from the subreddit r/Tenant, aiming to unveil trends in tenant concerns while exploring the adoption of LLMs and machine learning methods in social science research. We find that tenant concerns in topics like fee dispute and utility issues are consistently dominant in all four states analyzed while each state has other common tenant concerns special to itself. Moreover, we discover temporal trends in tenant concerns that provide important implications regarding the impact of the pandemic and the Eviction Moratorium.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study on the Use of 3D Scatterplots as 2D Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D scatterplots are a well-established plotting technique that can be used to represent data with three or more dimensions. On paper and computer monitors they are essentially two-dimensional projections of the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This transition from the 3D space to two dimensions is not done consistently among scientific software, as there is currently limited quantifiable evidence on the effectiveness of each approach. Notably, the frequent lack of visual cues such as with regard to depth perception is equivalent to a reduction of dimensionality by one. Hence, their use in manuscripts is less common or straightforward.
  In this empirical study, an online survey is conducted within an academic institution to identify and quantify the effectiveness of feature or feature combinations on 3D scatterplots in terms of reading time and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Automating High Quality RT Planning at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision, efficiency, and consistency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large, standardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT Planning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality treatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial volumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle in the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to clinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk (OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan quality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Eclipse of Varian. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters to reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions to deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations. A comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline produces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually, which traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to public research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine cohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025 challenge. This data set features more than 10 times the number of plans compared to the largest existing well-curated public data set to our best knowledge.

      <title>Explainable XR: Understanding User Behaviors of XR Environments using LLM-assisted Analytics Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Explainable XR, an end-to-end framework for analyzing user behavior in diverse eXtended Reality (XR) environments by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data interpretation assistance. Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users' multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts' perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.</description>

      <title>Making the Write Connections: Linking Writing Support Tools with Writer's Needs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work sheds light on whether and how creative writers' needs are met by existing research and commercial writing support tools (WST). We conducted a need finding study to gain insight into the writers' process during creative writing through a qualitative analysis of the response from an online questionnaire and Reddit discussions on r/Writing. Using a systematic analysis of 115 tools and 67 research papers, we map out the landscape of how digital tools facilitate the writing process. Our triangulation of data reveals that research predominantly focuses on the writing activity and overlooks pre-writing activities and the importance of visualization. We distill 10 key takeaways to inform future research on WST and point to opportunities surrounding underexplored areas. Our work offers a holistic and up-to-date account of how tools have transformed the writing process, guiding the design of future tools that address writers' evolving and unmet needs.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semantic Communication and Human Decision-Making into an End-to-End Sensing-Decision Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As early as 1949, Weaver defined communication in a very broad sense to include all procedures by which one mind or technical system can influence another, thus establishing the idea of semantic communication. With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided to the HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support HDM both in theory and in simulations. In this sense, our study reveals the fundamental design trade-off between maximizing the relevant semantic information and matching the cognitive capabilities of the HDM model. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency.</description>

Abstract: DNN-based language models perform excellently on various tasks, but even SOTA LLMs are susceptible to textual adversarial attacks. Adversarial texts play crucial roles in multiple subfields of NLP. However, current research has the following issues. (1) Most textual adversarial attack methods target rich-resourced languages. How do we generate adversarial texts for less-studied languages? (2) Most textual adversarial attack methods are prone to generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial texts. How do we construct high-quality adversarial robustness benchmarks? (3) New language models may be immune to part of previously generated adversarial texts. How do we update adversarial robustness benchmarks? To address the above issues, we introduce HITL-GAT, a system based on a general approach to human-in-the-loop generation of adversarial texts. HITL-GAT contains four stages in one pipeline: victim model construction, adversarial example generation, high-quality benchmark construction, and adversarial robustness evaluation. Additionally, we utilize HITL-GAT to make a case study on Tibetan script which can be a reference for the adversarial research of other less-studied languages.</description>

      <title>Learning to Plan with Personalized Preferences</title>

Abstract: Effective integration of AI agents into daily life requires them to understand and adapt to individual human preferences, particularly in collaborative roles. Although recent studies on embodied intelligence have advanced significantly, they typically adopt generalized approaches that overlook personal preferences in planning. We address this limitation by developing agents that not only learn preferences from few demonstrations but also learn to adapt their planning strategies based on these preferences. Our research leverages the observation that preferences, though implicitly expressed through minimal demonstrations, can generalize across diverse planning scenarios. To systematically evaluate this hypothesis, we introduce Preference-based Planning (PbP) benchmark, an embodied benchmark featuring hundreds of diverse preferences spanning from atomic actions to complex sequences. Our evaluation of SOTA methods reveals that while symbol-based approaches show promise in scalability, significant challenges remain in learning to generate and execute plans that satisfy personalized preferences. We further demonstrate that incorporating learned preferences as intermediate representations in planning significantly improves the agent's ability to construct personalized plans. These findings establish preferences as a valuable abstraction layer for adaptive planning, opening new directions for research in preference-guided plan generation and execution.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of AI Researchers in Scientific Discovery: What Is Missing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential of AI researchers in scientific discovery remains largely to be unleashed. Over the past decade, the presence of AI for Science (AI4Science) in the 145 Nature Index journals has increased ninefold, yet nearly 90% of AI4Science research remains predominantly led by experimental scientists. Drawing on the Diffusion of Innovation theory, we project that AI4Science's share of total publications will rise from 3.57% in 2024 to approximately 25% by 2050. Unlocking the potential of AI researchers is essential for driving this shift and fostering deeper integration of AI expertise into the research ecosystem. To this end, we propose structured and actionable workflows, alongside key strategies to position AI researchers at the forefront of scientific discovery. Furthermore, we outline three pivotal pathways: equipping experimental scientists with user-friendly AI tools to amplify the impact of AI researchers, bridging cognitive and methodological gaps to enable more direct participation in scientific discovery, and proactively cultivating a thriving AI-driven scientific ecosystem. By addressing these challenges, this work aims to empower AI researchers as a driving force in shaping the future of scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test: A Critical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the recent publication "ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test" by Restrepo Echavarr\'ia (2025), challenging its central claims regarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the conclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the criticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully justified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions that enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates that two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both valid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes between absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a three-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a machine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced evaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic underpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli experiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the two-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between the theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms, and the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper interpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the criticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on objective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates from, that of a human being.</description>
