      <title>General Molecular Communication Model in Multi-Layered Spherical Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical multi-layered structures are prevalent in numerous biological systems and engineered applications, including tumor spheroids, layered tissues, and multi-shell nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery. Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>SCAN-BEST: Efficient Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal Reliability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems continue to incorporate larger antenna arrays, the range of near-field propagation expands, making it more likely for users close to the transmitter to fall within the near-field regime. Traditional far-field beam training methods are no longer effective in this context. Additionally, near-field beam training presents challenges, since the training codebook must account for both angular and distance dimensions, leading to large codebook sizes. To reduce the in-band training overhead, we propose the Sub-6G Channel-Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework, which is motivated by the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels. SCAN-BEST utilizes preprocessed sub-6G channel estimates as input, and employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the probability of each beam being optimal within the near-field beam training codebook. Given the prediction uncertainty arising from the variance between sub-6G and mmWave channels, we introduce a conformal risk control (CRC)-based module that generates a set of beam candidates for further limited in-band training, enabling the final beam selection to formally meet user-defined target coverage rate. Numerical results confirm the thereoretical properties of SCAN-BEST in terms of the achieved coverage rate of the beam candidates and various metrics. Moreover, SCAN-BEST enjoys good scalability and robustness to various sub-6G system configurations, including to the sizes of calibration datasets.</description>

      <title>New constructions of asymptotically optimal periodic and aperiodic quasi-complementary sequence sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-complementary sequence sets (QCSSs) play an important role in multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems as they can support more users than perfect complementary sequence sets (PCSSs). The objective of this paper is to present new constructions of asymptotically optimal periodic and aperiodic QCSSs with large set sizes. Firstly, we construct a family of asymptotically optimal periodic $(p^{2n}, p^n-1, p^n-1, p^n+1)$ QCSSs with small alphabet size $p$, which has larger set size than the known family of periodic $(p^n(p^n-1), p^n-1, p^n-1, p^n+1)$ QCSSs. Secondly, we construct five new families of asymptotically optimal aperiodic QCSSs with large set sizes and low aperiodic tolerances. Each family of these aperiodic QCSSs has set size $\Theta(K^2)$ for some flock size $K$. Compared with known asymptotically optimal aperiodic QCSSs in the literature, the proposed aperiodic QCSSs by us have better parameters or new lengths of their constituent sequences.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmission and Control in a Goal-oriented NOMA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication shifts the focus from merely delivering timely information to maximizing decision-making effectiveness by prioritizing the transmission of high-value information. In this context, we introduce the Goal-oriented Tensor (GoT), a novel closed-loop metric designed to directly quantify the ultimate utility in Goal-oriented systems, capturing how effectively the transmitted information meets the underlying application's objectives. Leveraging the GoT, we model a Goal-oriented Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) network comprising multiple transmission-control loops. Operating under a pull-based framework, we formulate the joint optimization of transmission and control as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which we solve by deriving the belief state and training a Double-Dueling Deep Q-Network (D3QN). This framework enables adaptive decision-making for power allocation and control actions. Simulation results reveal a fundamental trade-off between transmission efficiency and control fidelity. Additionally, the superior utility of NOMA over Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) in multi-loop remote control scenarios is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of Gaussian mixture entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approximation method for the differential entropy $h(\mathbf{X})$ of a $q$-component Gaussian mixture in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We provide two examples of approximations using our method denoted by $\bar{h}^{\mathrm{Taylor}}_{C,m}(\mathbf{X})$ and $\bar{h}^{\mathrm{Polyfit}}_{C,m}(\mathbf{X})$. We show that $\bar{h}^{\mathrm{Taylor}}_{C,m}(\mathbf{X})$ provides an easy to compute lower bound to $h(\mathbf{X})$, while $\bar{h}^{\mathrm{Polyfit}}_{C,m}(\mathbf{X})$ provides an accurate and efficient approximation to $h(\mathbf{X})$. $\bar{h}^{\mathrm{Polyfit}}_{C,m}(\mathbf{X})$ is more accurate than known bounds, and conjectured to be much more resilient than the approximation of [5] in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Beamfocusing and Power Allocation for AN-Based PLS in Multiuser XL-MIMO with Multiple Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the downlink (DL) physical layer security (PLS) in a near-field (NF) extra-large multiple-input multiple-output MIMO (XL-MIMO) system. To enhance the secrecy rate (SR), null-space artificial noise (AN) is transmitted alongside the confidential message, ensuring orthogonality with legitimate user equipment (LUE) channels. The objective is to maximize the minimum SR by optimizing the NF beamfocusing matrix and power allocation between the signal and AN, considering various channel state information (CSI) conditions and transmit power constraints. The proposed approach uses successive convex approximation (SCA) for beamfocusing optimization and golden section search (GSS) for power allocation. The following open questions are addressed: (i) Can AN transmission further enhance SR for multiple LUEs in the presence of multiple eavesdropping user equipment (EUEs)? (ii) Can null-space AN transmission achieve attractive SR performance even without CSI availability for EUEs? Both questions are affirmatively answered and explored in detail, with an algorithm presented for joint beamfocusing design and AN-aided power allocation. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that either omit AN transmission or rely on maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) for beamfocusing.</description>

      <title>Dueling QR Codes: The Hyding of Dr. Jeckyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for encoding dual messages within standard Quick Response (QR) codes through precise half-pixel module splitting. This work challenges fundamental assumptions about deterministic decoding in the ISO/IEC 18004:2015 standard while maintaining complete compatibility with existing QR infrastructure. The proposed two-dimensional barcode attack enables angle-dependent message selection while maintaining compatibility with unmodified QR readers and the 100 million US mobile users who use their phone's built-in scanners. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested codes, watermarking, or error correction exploitation, our method achieves true one-to-many mapping by manipulating the physical sampling process built into the QR standard. By preserving critical function patterns while bifurcating data modules, we create automated codes that produce different but valid readings based on camera viewing angle. Experimental results demonstrate successful implementation across multiple use cases, including simple message text pairs, complex URLs (nsa.gov/nasa.gov), and security test patterns for malware and spam detectors (EICAR/GTUBE). Our technique achieves reliable dual-message decoding using standard QR readers at module scales of 9-11 pixels, with successful angle-dependent reading demonstrated across vertical, horizontal, and diagonal orientations. The method's success suggests potential applications beyond QR code phishing ('quishing') including two-factor authentication, anti-counterfeiting, and information density optimization. The half-pixel technique may offer future avenues for similar implementations in other 2D barcode formats such as Data Matrix and Aztec Code.</description>

      <title>SWIPT in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) into cell-free massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) system to enhance the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) performance. Closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the information-decoding receivers (IRs) and the average sum of harvested energy (sum-HE) at the energy-harvesting receivers (ERs) in the novel system model are derived to subsequently formulate a maximum total average sum-HE problem under a minimum SE threshold per each IR. This problem jointly optimizes the SIM phase-shift (PS) configuration and access points' (APs) power allocation, relying on long-term statistical channel state information (CSI). This non-convex problem is then transformed into more tractable forms. Then, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a layer-by-layer heuristic method for SIMs PS configuration that prioritizes sum-HE for the ERs and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based power allocation scheme to improve the achievable SE for the IRs. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve an almost 7-fold sum-HE gain as we increase the number of SIM layers, while the proposed power allocation (PPA) scheme often gains up to 40% in terms of the achievable minimum SE, compared to the equal power allocation.</description>

      <title>Sheaf-Theoretic Causal Emergence for Resilience Analysis in Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed systems often exhibit emergent behaviors that impact their resilience (Franz-Kaiser et al., 2020; Adilson E. Motter, 2002; Jianxi Gao, 2016). This paper presents a theoretical framework combining attributed graph models, flow-on-graph simulation, and sheaf-theoretic causal emergence analysis to evaluate system resilience. We model a distributed system as a graph with attributes (capturing component state and connections) and use sheaf theory to formalize how local interactions compose into global states. A flow simulation on this graph propagates functional loads and failures. To assess resilience, we apply the concept of causal emergence, quantifying whether macro-level dynamics (coarse-grained groupings) exhibit stronger causal efficacy (via effective information) than micro-level dynamics. The novelty lies in uniting sheaf-based formalization with causal metrics to identify emergent resilient structures. We discuss limitless potential applications (illustrated by microservices, neural networks, and power grids) and outline future steps toward implementing this framework (Lake et al., 2015).</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the decoding-to-LPN reduction via code smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem underlines several classic cryptographic primitives. Researchers have attempted to demonstrate the algorithmic hardness of this problem by finding reductions from the decoding problem of linear codes, for which several hardness results exist. Earlier studies used code smoothing as a tool to achieve reductions for codes with vanishing rate. This has left open the question of attaining a reduction with positive-rate codes. Addressing this case, we characterize the efficiency of the reduction in terms of the parameters of the decoding and LPN problems. As a conclusion, we isolate the parameter regimes for which a meaningful reduction is possible and the regimes for which its existence is unlikely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wiretap channel is a well-studied problem in the physical layer security literature. Although it is proven that the decoding error probability and information leakage can be made arbitrarily small in the asymptotic regime, further research on finite-blocklength codes is required on the path towards practical, secure communication systems. This work provides the first experimental characterization of a deep learning-based, finite-blocklength code construction for multi-tap fading wiretap channels without channel state information. In addition to the evaluation of the average probability of error and information leakage, we examine the designed codes in the presence of fading in terms of the equivocation rate and illustrate the influence of (i) the number of fading taps, (ii) differing variances of the fading coefficients, and (iii) the seed selection for the hash function-based security layer.</description>

      <title>Matrix Pre-orthogonal Matching Pursuit and Pseudo-Inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new fundamental algorithm called Matrix-POAFD to solve the matrix least square problem. The method is based on the matching pursuit principle. The method directly extracts, among the given features as column vectors of the measurement matrix, in the order of their importance, the decisive features for the observing vector. With competitive computational efficiency to the existing sophisticated least square solutions the proposed method, due to its explicit and iterative algorithm process, has the advantage of trading off minimum norms with tolerable error scales. The method inherits recently developed studies in functional space contexts. The second main contribution, also in the algorithm aspect, is to present a two-step iterative computation method for pseudo-inverse. We show that consecutively performing two least square solutions, of which one is to $X$ and the other to $X^*,$ results in the minimum norm least square solution. The two-step algorithm can also be combined into one solving a single least square problem but with respect to $XX^\ast.$ The result is extended to the functional formulation as well. To better explain the idea, as well as for the self-containing purpose, we give short surveys with proofs of key results on closely relevant subjects, including solutions with reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting, AFD type sparse representation in terms of matching pursuit, the general ${\mathcal H}$-$H_K$ formulation and pseudo-inverse of bounded linear operator in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC Waveform Design Based on Frequency-Domain Phase Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</description>

      <title>Infinite Eulerian paths are computable on graphs with vertices of infinite degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s, Gr\"unwald, and Weiszfeld theorem is a characterization of those infinite graphs which are Eulerian. That is, infinite graphs that admit infinite Eulerian paths. In this article we prove an effective version of the Erd\H{o}s, Gr\"unwald, and Weiszfeld theorem for a class of graphs where vertices of infinite degree are allowed, generalizing a theorem of D.Bean. Our results are obtained from a characterization of those finite paths in a graph that can be extended to infinite Eulerian paths.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic mutual information in quadratic estimation problems over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to group synchronization and quadratic assignment on random data, we study a general problem of Bayesian inference of an unknown ``signal'' belonging to a high-dimensional compact group, given noisy pairwise observations of a featurization of this signal. We establish a quantitative comparison between the signal-observation mutual information in any such problem with that in a simpler model with linear observations, using interpolation methods. For group synchronization, our result proves a replica formula for the asymptotic mutual information and Bayes-optimal mean-squared-error. Via analyses of this replica formula, we show that the conjectural phase transition threshold for computationally-efficient weak recovery of the signal is determined by a classification of the real-irreducible components of the observed group representation(s), and we fully characterize the information-theoretic limits of estimation in the example of angular/phase synchronization over $SO(2)$/$U(1)$. For quadratic assignment, we study observations given by a kernel matrix of pairwise similarities and a randomly permutated and noisy counterpart, and we show in a bounded signal-to-noise regime that the asymptotic mutual information coincides with that in a Bayesian spiked model with i.i.d. signal prior.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints arising from limitations on human memory in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. This provides strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and proposes that preference for intermediate melodic complexity is a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>3D-LMVIC: Learning-based Multi-View Image Coding with 3D Gaussian Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing multi-view image compression methods often rely on 2D projection-based similarities between views to estimate disparities. While effective for small disparities, such as those in stereo images, these methods struggle with the more complex disparities encountered in wide-baseline multi-camera systems, commonly found in virtual reality and autonomous driving applications. To address this limitation, we propose 3D-LMVIC, a novel learning-based multi-view image compression framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to derive geometric priors for accurate disparity estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a depth map compression model to minimize geometric redundancy across views, along with a multi-view sequence ordering strategy based on a defined distance measure between views to enhance correlations between adjacent views. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D-LMVIC achieves superior performance compared to both traditional and learning-based methods. Additionally, it significantly improves disparity estimation accuracy over existing two-view approaches.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called WingIt, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on WingIt and the plug-in estimator for $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems.</description>
