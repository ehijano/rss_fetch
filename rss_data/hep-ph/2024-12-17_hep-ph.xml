      <title>Minimal Electroweak Baryogenesis via Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet $S$ with an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry offers a minimal framework for realizing electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) during a first-order electroweak phase transition. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism where spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking enables EWBG via domain walls separating two distinct phases of the $S$ field. These domain walls feature restored (or weakly broken) EW symmetry in their cores and sweep through space, generating the baryon asymmetry below the temperature of EW symmetry breaking. We identify the key conditions for the existence of EW-symmetric domain wall cores and analyze the dynamics required for wall propagation over sufficient spatial volumes. Additionally, we outline the CP-violating sources necessary for baryogenesis under different regimes of domain wall evolution. The parameter space accommodating this mechanism spans singlet masses from sub-eV to 15 GeV, accompanied by a non-vanishing mixing with the Higgs boson. Unlike the standard realization of EWBG in the minimal singlet-extended SM, which is notoriously difficult to test, our scenario can be probed by a wide range of existing and upcoming experiments, including fifth force searches, rare meson decays, and EDM measurements.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decay with light sterile neutrinos: the contact terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrinoless double-beta decay in extensions of the Standard Model that include $n$ right-handed neutrino singlets, with masses $m_s$ below the GeV scale. Generalizing recently developed matching methods, we determine the $m_s$ dependence of the short-range $nn \to pp$ couplings that appear to leading order in the chiral effective field theory description of neutrinoless double beta decay. We focus on two scenarios, corresponding to the minimal $\nu$SM and left-right symmetric models. We illustrate the impact of our new results in the case of the $\nu$SM, showing a significant impact on the neutrinoless double-beta decay half-life when $m_s$ is in the 200-800 MeV range.</description>

      <title>Aspen Open Jets: Unlocking LHC Data for Foundation Models in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are deep learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data which are capable of generalizing to multiple datasets and/or downstream tasks. This work demonstrates how data collected by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider can be useful in pre-training foundation models for HEP. Specifically, we introduce the AspenOpenJets dataset, consisting of approximately 180M high $p_T$ jets derived from CMS 2016 Open Data. We show how pre-training the OmniJet-$\alpha$ foundation model on AspenOpenJets improves performance on generative tasks with significant domain shift: generating boosted top and QCD jets from the simulated JetClass dataset. In addition to demonstrating the power of pre-training of a jet-based foundation model on actual proton-proton collision data, we provide the ML-ready derived AspenOpenJets dataset for further public use.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium-like states in proton collisions: Fragmentation and resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of doubly bottomed tetraquarks ($X_{b\bar{b}q\bar{q}}$) as well as fully bottomed ones ($T_{4b}$), to which we collectively refer as "bottomonium-like" states. We rely upon the variable-flavor number-scheme fragmentation at leading power, where a single parton perturbatively splits into the corresponding Fock state, which then hadronizes into the color-neutral, observed tetraquark. To this end, we build new sets of DGLAP/HF-NRevo consistent, hadron-structure oriented collinear fragmentation functions, which we name TQHL1.1 and TQ4Q1.1 parametrizations. They extend and supersede the corresponding 1.0 versions recently derived in previous works. The first family describes the fragmentation of doubly heavy tetraquarks and is based on an improved version of the Suzuki model for the heavy-quark channel. The second family depicts the fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks and embodies initial-scale inputs for gluon and heavy-quark channels, both of them calculated by the hands of potential nonrelativistic QCD. As a phenomenological application, we provide novel predictions for tetraquark-plus-jet high-energy distributions, computed within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization from (sym)JETHAD, at 14 TeV and 100 TeV FCC.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: the Modified BFKL, or where did it all go?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue exploring the Born-Oppenheimer renormalization group generating evolution in frequency of physical observables. In this paper we study the evolution of the total cross section for dilute-dilute scattering retaining only eikonal emissions. We derive and analyze the analog of the BFKL equation in this framework. The frequency evolution has a very strong effect on the solutions of the BO-BFKL equation, slowing down the evolution of the scattering amplitude in a spectacular fashion: the intercept of the Pomeron is decreased by about a factor of three relative to the canonical LO BFKL result. The anomalous dimension is also modified significantly - from the BFKL value of one it goes down to the negative value of $\approx-0.2$. Introducing saturation boundary as a proxy for the full saturation dynamics, we find that the dependence of the saturation momentum on rapidity $\eta$ becomes quite weak with $Q^2_s\sim e^{a\bar\alpha_s\eta}$ with $a\approx 0.784$ as opposed to the BFKL value $a=4.88$. Our results underscore the necessity to take into account the DGLAP effects in the high energy evolution. This is left for future work.</description>

      <title>Coherent enhancement of QED cross-sections in electromagnetic backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce form factors that relate the amplitude of a QED process in vacuum to its corresponding background-field process. The latter is characterised by a reduced S-matrix element where one or more photon field operators are replaced by classical background fields. In the associated Feynman diagram, external photon lines are supplanted with lines representing the c-number field. This modifies the cross section by factors proportional to powers of the Fourier amplitude of the classical field (and its complex conjugate). We demonstrate this explicitly by comparing different reaction channels of low-energy photon-photon scattering in a classical background. We find that background field cross sections typically undergo coherent enhancement and for some reaction channels display a more favourable scaling with centre-of-mass energy compared to the vacuum process. Similar coherent enhancement may be found for leading-order pair annihilation to one photon, but this competes with kinematic suppression. This suppression can be minimised by using an x-ray free electron laser as the classical background.</description>

      <title>Likelihood of a zero in the proton elastic electric form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working with the $29$ available data on the ratio of proton electric and magnetic form factors, $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/ G_M^p(Q^2)$, and independent of any model or theory of strong interactions, we use the Schlessinger point method to objectively address the question of whether the ratio possesses a zero and, if so, its location. Our analysis predicts that, with 50% confidence, the data are consistent with the existence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 10.37\,$GeV$^2$. The level of confidence increases to $99.9$\% on $Q^2 \leq 13.06\,$GeV$^2$. Significantly, the likelihood that existing data are consistent with the absence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 14.49\,$GeV$^2$ is $1/1$-million.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Event Classification Model for High Energy Physics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a foundation model for event classification in high-energy physics, built on a Graph Neural Network architecture and trained on 120 million simulated proton-proton collision events spanning 12 distinct physics processes. The model is pretrained to learn a general and robust representation of collision data using challenging multiclass and multilabel classification tasks. Its performance is evaluated across five event classification tasks, which include both physics processes used during pretraining and new processes not encountered during pretraining. Fine-tuning the pretrained model significantly improves classification performance, particularly in scenarios with limited training data, demonstrating gains in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To investigate the underlying mechanisms behind these performance improvements, we employ a representational similarity evaluation framework based on Centered Kernel Alignment. This analysis reveals notable differences in the learned representations of fine-tuned pretrained models compared to baseline models trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Primordial Black Hole Production via Delayed Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at peak nucleation. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Testing the Fifth Force on Lepton Spins through Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a fifth force mediated by a light vector boson that couples to lepton spins, characterized by axial-vector couplings to leptons and vector couplings to nucleons. This interaction generates a potential proportional to the inner product of the lepton spin vector and the nucleon-lepton relative velocity vector, a feature extensively explored with precision spin sensors. Employing weak symmetry, we show that left-handed charged lepton couplings naturally extend to left-handed neutrinos, enabling this fifth force to influence neutrino oscillations. For electron-nucleon couplings, we find that solar and reactor neutrino experiments provide comparable constraints to those from spin sensors and surpass them in the short-range fifth force region. For muon-nucleon couplings, neutrino oscillation experiments exclude the fifth force as a viable explanation for the muon $ g-2 $ anomaly in the context of a vector mediator, tightening the bounds by two orders of magnitude in coupling strength by solar and atmospheric neutrino data. Our results highlight the critical role of neutrino oscillations in probing fifth forces acting across all three generations of lepton spins.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on proton PDFs from HERA DIS, Drell-Yan, W/Z Boson production, and projected EIC measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new parton distribution functions (PDFs) at next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD, derived from a comprehensive global QCD analysis of high-precision data sets from combined HERA deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), the Tevatron, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To improve constraints on quark flavor separation, we incorporate Drell-Yan pair production data, which provides critical sensitivity to the quark distributions. In addition, we include the latest W and Z boson production data from the CDF, D0, ATLAS, and CMS collaborations, further refining both quark and gluon distributions. Our nominal global QCD fit integrates these datasets and examines the resulting impact on the PDFs and their associated uncertainties. Uncertainties in the PDFs are quantified using the Hessian method, ensuring robust error estimates. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$, and proton PDFs in light of the projected measurements from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), where improvements in precision are expected. The analysis also investigates the effects of inclusive jet and dijet production data, which provide enhanced constraints on the gluon PDF and $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$.</description>

      <title>The relativistic effects in the strong and electromagnetic decays of ${D^*}$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the complete Salpeter equation and use the obtained relativistic wave function to calculate the strong and radiative electromagnetic decays of ${D^*}$ meson. The focus of this study is on the relativistic corrections. In our method, the wave function of $D$ meson is not pure $S$-wave, but includes both nonrelativistic $S$-wave and relativistic $P$-wave, while the wave function of $D^*$ meson includes nonrelativistic $S$-wave, as well as relativistic $P$-wave and $D$-wave. So in this case, the decay ${D^{*}\rightarrow{D}\gamma}$ is not a nonrelativistic $M1$ transition, but rather an $M1+E2+M3+E4$ decay in our method. We find that in strong decay $D^{*}\rightarrow{D}{\pi}$, the nonrelativistic contribution is dominant, while in electromagnetic decay ${D^{*}\rightarrow{D}\gamma}$, the relativistic correction is dominant.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter -- A Novel proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel proposal is made to account for the dark matter component of the Universe. Ultralight dark matter with mass $\leq {\cal{O}}(10^{-22})~eV$ is one of the strong candidates for the missing mass which aids the formation of galaxies as well as holding them together. They are also known as fuzzy dark matter(FDM) which will come under Cold Dark matter. The question is what is this particle and its implications. How do we experimentally see it is an outstanding question. We propose to answer some of these questions with some evidences and the estimates.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Coupling of Axion Dark Matter to Neutron Spins at Spallation Sources via Rabi Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the mass spectrum of the hidden-charm hybrid states with the $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, $0^{++}$, $0^{--}$, $1^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, $1^{-+}$, $1^{--}$, $2^{-+}$ and $2^{++}$ via the QCD sum rules in a consistent way. We calculate the vacuum condensates up to dimensions-6 by taking account of both the leading order and next-to-leading order contributions, and take the energy scale formula $\mu=\sqrt{M^2_{X/Y/Z}-(2{\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ to choose the suitable energy scales of the QCD spectral densities, it is the first time to explore the energy scale dependence of the QCD sum rules for the hidden-charm hybrid states.</description>

      <title>Decays $\tau \to f_0(\pi,K) \nu_\tau$ and $\tau \to 3 \pi \nu_\tau$ accounting for the contribution of $f_0(500)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $U(3) \times U(3)$ quark NJL model, $\tau$ lepton decays with the production of scalar mesons $f_0(\pi,K])$ and neutrinos are studied, where $f_0=f_0(500), f_0(980)$. It is shown that these decays mainly occur via contact channels and channels with axial-vector mesons $a_1$, $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$. All mesons are considered as quark-antiquark states in this case. The obtained results can be considered as predictions for future experiments. The obtained estimates for the branching fractions of the $\tau \to \pi^-2\pi^0 \nu_\tau$ decay taking into account the contributions of the $\rho\pi$ and $f_0(500)\pi$ states are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the $\psi(4160)$ Resonance Parameter Using $B^+\to K^+\mu^+\mu^-$ Data in the Context of Unquenched Charmonium Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A puzzling phenomenon, where the measured mass of the $\psi(4160)$ is pushed higher, presents a challenge to current theoretical models of hadron spectroscopy. This study suggests that the issue arises from analyses based on the outdated quenched charmonium spectrum. In the past two decades, the discovery of new hadronic states has emphasized the importance of the unquenched effect. Under the unquenched picture, six vector charmonium states-$\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4220)$, $\psi(4380)$, $\psi(4415)$, and $\psi(4500)$-are identified in the $4 \sim 4.5$ GeV range, contrasting with the three states predicted in the quenched model. We reevaluate the resonance parameters of the $\psi(4160)$ using the di-muon invariant mass spectrum of $B^+ \to K^+ \mu^+ \mu^-$ and unquenched charmonium spectroscopy. Our analysis finds the $\psi(4160)$ mass at $4145.76 \pm 4.48$ MeV, indicating previous overestimations. This conclusion is supported by analyzing $e^+e^- \to D_s \bar{D}_s^*$. Our findings have significant implications for both hadron spectroscopy and search for new physics signals by $R_K$.</description>

      <title>Study on the structure of the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state within the framework of effective field theory. We firstly show the construction of the Lagrangian describing meson-meson-meson and meson-diquark-diquark interactions. By using the Feynman rule, we calculate the effective potentials corresponding to the coupled channels of $D\bar{D}^{*}/D^{*}\bar{D}$ and $S_{cq}\bar{A}_{cq}/A_{cq}\bar{S}_{cq}$ with $S_{cq}$ ($A_{cq}$) the scalar (axial vector) diquark composed of $c$ and $q$ quarks. After solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the on-shell parametrized form and compare our numerical results with the experimental mass and width of $Z_{c}(3900)$, we find that the $Z_{c}(3900)$ state can be explained as the mixture of $D\bar{D}^{*}/D^{*}\bar{D}$ and $S_{cq}\bar{A}_{cq}/A_{cq}\bar{S}_{cq}$ components.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Deep Learning Methods for Particle Shower Reconstruction in the DHCAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurement of hadronic final states presents complex experimental challenges. The study explores the concept of a gaseous Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (DHCAL) and discusses the potential benefits of employing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods for future collider experiments. In particular, we use GNN to describe calorimeter clusters as point clouds or a collection of data points representing a three-dimensional object in space. Combined with Graph Attention Transformers (GATs) and DeepSets algorithms, this results in an improvement over existing baseline techniques for particle identification and energy resolution. We discuss the challenges encountered in implementing GNN methods for energy measurement in digital calorimeters, e.g., the large variety of hadronic shower shapes and the hyper-parameter optimization. We also discuss the dependency of the measured performance on the angle of the incoming particle and on the detector granularity. Finally, we highlight potential future directions and applications of these techniques.</description>

      <title>Toponium: the smallest bound state and simplest hadron in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore toponium, the smallest known quantum bound state of a top quark and its antiparticle, bound by the strong force. With a Bohr radius of $8 \times 10^{-18}$~m and a lifetime of $2.5 \times 10^{-25}$ s, toponium uniquely probes microphysics. Unlike all other hadrons, it is governed by ultraviolet freedom, exhibiting feeble interactions at distances much smaller than $10^{-15}$ m, rather than infrared slavery that characterizes powerful interactions at approximately $10^{-15}$~m. This distinction offers novel insights into quantum chromodynamics. Our analysis reveals a toponium signal exceeding five standard deviations in the distribution of the cross section ratio between $e^+e^- \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $e^+e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}$ ($q=b,~c,~s,~d,~u$), based on 400~fb$^{-1}$ {(1 fb = $10^{-43}~{\rm m}^2$)} of data collected at around 341~GeV, driven by quantum interference. This discovery enables a top quark mass measurement with an uncertainty reduced by a factor of ten compared to current precision levels. Detection prospects at the Circular Electron Positron Collider or the Future Circular Lepton Collider underscore their potential to revolutionize our understanding of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>C-Code Reader of Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process $\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda_c \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ serves as a tool for exploring new physics, with contributions from scalar, vector, and tensor hadronic currents in various models. These form factors are derived from the quark model or lattice QCD. This work introduces a C-code for efficiently reading lattice QCD form factors for these currents, significantly outperforming a previous Mathematica-based approach, with a speed improvement of over 64 times per data point. The code, available on GitHub $(https://github.com/darkfiresmith96/Lattice_QCD)$, also features a web interface for user inputs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Photon and Dark $Z$ Model Parameters in the $B$ and $K$ Meson Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) decays of $B$ and $K$ mesons in the context of a dark $U(1)_D$ model with a dark photon/dark $Z$ mass between 10 MeV and 2 GeV. While the model improves the fit to certain decay distributions, such as $B \to K^{(*)} \ell^+ \ell^- $ and $ B_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^- $, it is ruled out by stringent experimental constraints, including atomic parity violation, $K^+ \to \mu^+ + \text{invisible} $, and $ B_s - \overline{B}_s $ mixing. To address these constraints, the model is extended with three modifications; allowing additional invisible decays of $ Z_D $, introducing a direct vector coupling of $ Z_D $ to muons, and including a direct coupling of $ Z_D $ to both muons and electrons, with fine-tuning to cancel the mixing-induced coupling to electrons. Among these extensions, only the third scenario, involving fine-tuned electron coupling, remains consistent with all experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Strangeonium spectrum with the screening effects and interpretation of $h_1(1911)$ and $h_1(2316)$ observed by BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by two news states $h_1(1911)$ and $h_1(2316)$ observed by BESIII, we have investigated the mass spectrum and the strong decay properties of the strangeonium mesons within the modified Godfrey-Isgur model by considering the screening effects. We have determined the free parameters using the masses and widths of the well established $s\bar{s}$ states $\phi(1020)$, $\phi(1680)$, $h_1(1415)$, $f_2^\prime(1525)$, and $\phi_3(1850)$. According to our results, $h_1(1911)$ and $h_1(2316)$ could be well explained as states $h_1(2^1P_1)$ and $h_1(3^1P_1)$ $s\bar{s}$ states, respectively. Meanwhile, the possible assignments of $X(2000)$, $\eta_2(1870)$, and $\phi(2170)$ as $3^3S_1$, $1^1D_2$, and $2^3D_1$ are also discussed. Furthermore, the masses and widths of the $2S$, $3S$, $1P$, $2P$, $3P$, $1D$, and $2D$ $s\bar{s}$ states are also given and compared with various theoretical predictions, which is helpful for the observations and confirmations of these states in future.</description>

      <title>Investigating triply heavy tetraquark states through QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the method of QCD sum rules to study the \(QQ\bar{Q}\bar{q}\) and \(QQ\bar{Q}\bar{s}\) tetraquark states, where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d$, with the quantum number \(J^P = 0^{+}\). We consider the contributions of vacuum condensates up to dimension-9 in the operator product expansion, and use the energy scale formula \(\mu = \sqrt{M_{X}^2 - (i\mathbb{M}_c + j\mathbb{M}_b)^2} - k\mathbb{M}_s\) to determine the optimal energy scales for the QCD spectral densities. Our results indicate that triply charm tetraquark states \(cc\bar{c}\bar{q}\) and \(cc\bar{c}\bar{s}\) have masses in the ranges of $5.38-5.84\,\text{GeV}$ and $5.66-6.16\,\text{GeV}$, respectively. In the bottom sector, triply bottom tetraquark states \(bb\bar{b}\bar{q}\) and \(bb\bar{b}\bar{s}\) have masses in the ranges of $14.89-15.55\,\text{GeV}$ and $14.95-15.66\,\text{GeV}$, respectively. This study could help distinguish these states in upcoming high-energy nuclear and particle experiments.</description>

      <title>Charmful two-body $\Omega_b$ decays in the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the singly and doubly charmful two-body $\Omega_b^-$ decays using the light-front quark model. Our findings reveal that most branching fractions calculated in this study, such as ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^- D^0,\Xi^{-}D^{*0}) = (1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\pm 0.2, 2.0^{+1.3}_{-0.8}\pm 0.5)\times10^{-4}$, are ten to one hundred times larger than those reported in previous calculations. Additionally, we interpret the ratio ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Omega^- J/\psi)/{\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Omega^- \eta_c)\simeq 3.4$ within the helicity framework. While the decay involving external $W$-boson emission appears to be suppressed by the $b\to u \bar c s$ weak transition, it still yields a significant branching fraction. For instance, ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to \Xi^0 D_s^{*-}) = (8.1\pm 0.5^{+2.0}_{-1.8})\times 10^{-5}$ and ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^{*0}D_s^{-},\Xi^{*0}D_s^{*-}) = (8.0\pm 0.5^{+0.9}_{-0.8}, 16.3\pm 0.9^{+3.2}_{-3.0})\times10^{-5}$, with values reaching as large as $10^{-4}$. These predictions are well within the experimental reach of LHCb.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of Goldstone excitation from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11746v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the holographic approach, we investigate the interplay between the order parameter and Goldstone modes in the real-time dynamics of the chiral phase transition. By quenching the system to a different thermal bath and obtaining different kinds of initial states, we solve the real-time evolution of the system numerically. Our main focus is on studying far-from equilibrium dynamics of strongly-coupled system and universal scaling behaviors related to such dynamics. The most striking observation is that an additional prethermalization stage emerges at non-critical temperature after introducing the Goldstone modes, which is not reported in any previous studies. Some basic properties related to this additional prethermalization stage have been discussed in detail. More interestingly, we also report a new scaling relation describing non-equilibrium evolution at non-critical temperature. This additional universal behavior indicates the appearance of a non-thermal fixed point in the dynamical region.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Neutrino Lasers from Radioactive Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance emerges from collective spontaneous emission in optically pumped gases, and is characterized by photon emission enhancements of up to $\frac{1}{4}N^{2}$ in an $N$ atom system. The gain mechanism derives from correlations developed within the decay medium rather than from stimulated emission as in lasing, so analog of this process should be possible for fermionic final states. We introduce here the concept of superradiant neutrino emission from a radioactive Bose Einstein condensate, which can form the basis for a superradiant neutrino laser. A plausible experimental realization based on a condensate of electron-capture isotope $^{83}$Rb could exhibit effective radioactive decay rates accelerated from 82 days to minutes in viably sized rubidium condensates of $10^{6}$ atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceedings we study the sensitivity of the ESSnuSB experiment to probe quantum decoherence. ESSnuSB is a future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment which aims to measure $\delta_{\rm CP}$ by probing the second oscillation maximum. Using the open quantum system formalism for decoherence, we have shown that the sensitivity of ESSnuSB to constrain the decoherence parameters is better than MINOS but comparable to DUNE. We have also shown that the CP measurement capability of ESSnuSB is robust in presence of decoherence.</description>

      <title>Quark and gluon entanglement in the proton based on a light-front Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that the wave function of a proton can be derived relativistically and nonperturbatively from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian, investigating the quantum correlation between quarks and gluons offers a novel perspective on the internal structure of partons within a proton. In this work, we address this topic by computing the spin and longitudinal momentum entanglement of each parton inside the proton. The utilized wave functions are generated using Basis Light-front Quantization (BLFQ), incorporating both the valence quarks and one dynamical gluon Fock sectors, $\left|qqq\right\rangle$ and $\left|qqq\right\rangle +\left|qqqg\right\rangle$. Our calculations indicate that the dynamical gluon significantly enhances entanglement among the proton's partons. Additionally, we examine the spin entanglement of quarks and gluons at fixed values of longitudinal momentum fraction, revealing that the presence of a gluon may amplify the informational exchanges between quarks. Finally, these findings suggest the potential for experimental verification of the entanglement between partons by measuring parton helicity distributions in the proton.</description>

      <title>Probing sub-TeV Higgsinos aided by a ML-based top tagger in the context of Trilinear RPV SUSY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing higgsinos remains a challenge at the LHC owing to their small production cross-sections and the complexity of the decay modes of the nearly mass degenerate higgsino states. The existing limits on higgsino mass are much weaker compared to its bino and wino counterparts. This leaves a large chunk of sub-TeV supersymmetric parameter space unexplored so far. In this work, we explore the possibility of probing higgsino masses in the 400 - 1000 GeV range. We consider a simplified supersymmetric scenario where R-Parity is violated through a baryon number violating trilinear coupling. We adopt a machine learning-based top tagger to tag the boosted top jets originating from higgsinos, and for our collider analysis, we use a BDT classifier to discriminate signal over SM backgrounds. We construct two signal regions characterized by at least one top jet and different multiplicities of $b$-jets and light jets. Combining the statistical significance obtained from the two signal regions, we show that higgsino mass as high as 925 GeV can be probed at the high luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Searching for neutrino self-interactions at future muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-TeV muon colliders offer a powerful means of accessing new physics coupled to muons while generating clean and intense high-energy neutrino beams via muon decays. We study a fixed-target experiment leveraging the neutrino beams and a forward detector pointing at the interaction point of the muon collider. The sensitivity to neutrino self-interactions is analyzed as a feasibility study, focusing on the leptonic scalar $\phi$ exclusively coupled to the Standard Model neutrinos. Our work shows that projections from both the main and forward detectors can enhance the existing limits by two orders of magnitude, surpassing other future experiments.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of the quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of the quark propagator with the spectral DSE. The spectral gap equation is solved with the input of the spectral representation of the gluon and a causal STI-construction for the quark-gluon vertex. The latter includes a potential infrared enhancement of the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure that accommodates for the physical strength of chiral symmetry breaking. We find a critical vertex strength, below which the quark has a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. While the nature of the first singularity does not change above the critical strength, we find that the quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex conjugate poles that are located approximately at the sum of quark pole mass and peak position of the quark-gluon coupling. These additional poles lead to violations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. While the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure in full QCD is below the critical one, that of commonly used vertex models, which rely solely on the classical vertex structure, is typically above it. Finally, we discuss how these additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral symmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the quark-gluon vertex.</description>

      <title>Accurate Surrogate Amplitudes with Calibrated Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks for LHC physics have to be accurate, reliable, and controlled. Using surrogate loop amplitudes as a use case, we first show how activation functions can be systematically tested with KANs. For reliability and control, we learn uncertainties together with the target amplitude over phase space. Systematic uncertainties can be learned by a heteroscedastic loss, but a comprehensive learned uncertainty requires Bayesian networks or repulsive ensembles. We compute pull distributions to show to what level learned uncertainties are calibrated correctly for cutting-edge precision surrogates.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating Jet Radiation with Autoregressive Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative networks are an exciting tool for fast LHC event generation. Usually, they are used to generate configurations with a fixed number of particles. Autoregressive transformers allow us to generate events with variable numbers of particles, very much in line with the physics of QCD jet radiation. We show how they can learn a factorized likelihood for jet radiation and extrapolate in terms of the number of generated jets. For this extrapolation, bootstrapping training data and training with modifications of the likelihood loss can be used.</description>

      <title>Predictions for dimuon production in high-energy neutrino-proton collisions using the color dipole model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions of high-energy neutrinos with matter can be studied through the angular separation observed in dimuon production, an observable particularly sensitive to the transverse momentum dynamics of partons. In this work, we develop a Monte Carlo event generator based on the color dipole model, interfaced with Pythia8 for parton showering and hadronization simulations, to predict dimuon production cross sections in neutrino-proton collisions at energies relevant to IceCube and future detectors. The color dipole formalism generates larger transverse momentum compared to standard Pythia predictions, enhancing the yield of angularly separated high-energy muons.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from explosive transients at the dawn of multi-messenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of time-domain astronomy and the game-changing next generation of telescopes, we have unprecedented opportunities to explore the most energetic events in our Universe through electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. These are elementary particles, which exist in three different flavors and change the latter as they propagate in the dense core of astrophysical sources as well as en route to Earth. To capitalize on existing and upcoming multi-messenger opportunities, it is crucial to understand: 1. the role of neutrinos in explosive transient sources as well as in the synthesis of the elements heavier than iron; 2. the impact of neutrino physics on the multi-messenger observables; 3. the information on the source physics carried by the detectable neutrino signal. In this review, the status of this exciting and fast-moving field is outlined, focusing on astrophysical sources linked to collapsing massive stars and neutron-star mergers. In light of the upcoming plethora of multi-messenger data, outstanding open issues concerning the optimization of multi-messenger detection strategies are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using data samples of 983.0~$\rm fb^{-1}$ and 427.9~$\rm fb^{-1}$ accumulated with the Belle and Belle~II detectors operating at the KEKB and SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders, singly Cabibbo-suppressed decays $\Xi_c^{+} \to pK_{S}^{0}$, $\Xi_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+$, and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Sigma^{0} \pi^+$ are observed for the first time. The ratios of branching fractions of $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to p K_{S}^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Lambda \pi^{+}$, and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Sigma^{0} \pi^{+}$ relative to that of $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^- \pi^{+} \pi^{+}$ are measured to be \begin{equation} \frac{{\cal B}(\Xi_c^+ \to pK_S^0)}{{\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{-} \pi^+ \pi^+)} = (2.47 \pm 0.16 \pm 0.07)\% \notag, \end{equation} \begin{equation} \frac{{\cal B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+)}{{\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{-} \pi^+ \pi^+)} = (1.56 \pm 0.14 \pm 0.09)\% \notag, \end{equation} \begin{equation} \frac{{\cal B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Sigma^0 \pi^+)}{{\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{-} \pi^+ \pi^+)} = (4.13 \pm 0.26 \pm 0.22)\% \notag. \end{equation} Multiplying these values by the branching fraction of the normalization channel, ${\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{-} \pi^+\pi^+) = (2.9 \pm 1.3)\%$, the absolute branching fractions are determined to be \begin{equation} {\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to p K_{S}^{0}) = (7.16 \pm 0.46 \pm 0.20 \pm 3.21) \times 10^{-4} \notag, \end{equation} \begin{equation} {\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Lambda \pi^+) = (4.52 \pm 0.41 \pm 0.26 \pm 2.03) \times 10^{-4} \notag, \end{equation} \begin{equation} {\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Sigma^0 \pi^+) = (1.20 \pm 0.08 \pm 0.07 \pm 0.54) \times 10^{-3} \notag. \end{equation} The first and second uncertainties above are statistical and systematic, respectively, while the third ones arise from the uncertainty in ${\cal B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{-} \pi^{+} \pi^{+})$.</description>

      <title>Designing weight regularizations based on Lefschetz thimbles to stabilize complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex Langevin (CL) method shows significant potential in addressing the numerical sign problem. Nonetheless, it often produces incorrect results when used without any stabilization techniques. Leveraging insights from previous research that links Lefschetz thimbles and CL, we explore a strategy to regularize the CL method to address this issue of incorrect convergence. Specifically, we implement weight regularizations inspired by the associated Lefschetz thimble structure and correct the bias to retrieve the correct results of the original theory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by solving the SU(N) Polyakov chain model and various scalar models, including the cosine model and the one-link model, across a broad range of couplings where the CL method previously failed. We also discuss the potential application of these insights to gauge theories in practical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new method to calculate perturbatively the isospectral Hermitian theory for the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric $i\phi^3$ quantum field theory in $d$ dimensions, whose result is local. The result of the new method in $1$ dimension reproduces our previous result in the $ix^3$ quantum mechanics, and the new method can be seen as a generalization of our previous method to quantum field theory. We also find the isospectral local Hermitian theory has the same form in all dimensions and differs in coefficients only, and our previous results in quantum mechanics can be used directly to determine the form of the isospectral local Hermitian quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Probing Decaying Dark Matter Using the Post-EoR HI 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the HI 21-cm power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch as a probe of a cosmological model with decaying dark matter particles. The unstable particles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive daughter. We assume, that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be, unstable and quantify the decay using the life-time $\Gamma^{-1}$ and the relative mass splitting $\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter. The redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm signal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering, imprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background evolution and the suppression of power on small scales.We find that with an idealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA-I Mid like radio-array, $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.1\%$ and $4.64\%$ around their fiducial values of $\epsilon = 0.01 $ and $\Gamma = 0.074 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter 2024 -- Bulk Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second Hot QCD Matter 2024 conference at IIT Mandi focused on various ongoing topics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, encompassing theoretical and experimental perspectives. This proceedings volume includes 19 contributions that collectively explore diverse aspects of the bulk properties of hot QCD matter. The topics encompass the dynamics of electromagnetic fields, transport properties, hadronic matter, spin hydrodynamics, and the role of conserved charges in high-energy environments. These studies significantly enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of hot QCD matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in high-energy nuclear collisions. Advances in theoretical frameworks, including hydrodynamics, spin dynamics, and fluctuation studies, aim to improve theoretical calculations and refine our knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter. Experimental efforts, such as those conducted by the ALICE and STAR collaborations, play a vital role in validating these theoretical predictions and deepening our insight into the QCD phase diagram, collectivity in small systems, and the early-stage behavior of strongly interacting matter. Combining theoretical models with experimental observations offers a comprehensive understanding of the extreme conditions encountered in relativistic heavy-ion and proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Interference in Fuzzy Dark Matter Filaments: Idealised Models and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Classical worldlines from scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic diagrammatic investigation of the classical limit of observables computed from scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory through the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism, motivated by the study of gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We achieve the manifest cancellation of divergences in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit at the integrand level beyond one loop by employing the Schwinger parametrisation to rewrite both cut and uncut propagators in a wordline-like representation before they are combined. The resulting finite classical integrand takes the same form as the counterpart in the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) formalism of Mogull et al., and in fact exactly coincides with the latter in various examples, showing explicitly the equivalence between scattering amplitude and worldline formalisms. The classical causality flow, as expressed by the retarded propagator prescription, appears as an emergent feature. Examples are presented for impulse observables in electrodynamics and a scalar model at two loops, as well as certain subclasses of diagrams to higher orders and all orders.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Holographic Wilson Loop Correlators and Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. Although experiments and numerical simulations have solidly confirmed confinement, its physical origin remains mysterious today, and finding a theoretical explanation for it is a long-standing and challenging problem in physics and mathematics. Inspired by the recent progress in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we compute the Wilson loop correlators of the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory holographically in an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane background. The quantum gravity fluctuations of the near-horizon region are considered, which consequently affect the holographic Wilson loop correlators. Within this framework, the results suggest that the confinement of the super-Yang-Mills theory is induced by the near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations of the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane.</description>

      <title>A New Census of the Universe's Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of what is the total entropy of the universe, how it compares to the maximal entropy of de Sitter space, and how it is distributed across the universe's components, bears considerable importance for a number of reasons. Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>New BaBar studies of high-order radiation and the new landscape of data-driven HVP predictions of the muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A measurement of additional radiation in $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^- \gamma$ and $e^+e^- \to \pi^+\pi^- \gamma$ initial-state-radiation events is presented using the full $BaBar$ data sample. For the first time results are presented at next-to- and next-to-next-to-leading order, with one and two additional photons, respectively, for radiation from the initial and final states. The comparison with the predictions from Phokhara and AfkQed generators reveals discrepancies for the former in the one-photon rates and angular distributions. While this disagreement has a negligible effect on the $e^+e^- \to \pi^+\pi^- (\gamma)$ cross section measured by $BaBar$, the impact on the KLOE and BESIII measurements is estimated and found to be indicative of significant systematic effects. The findings shed a new light on the longstanding deviation among the muon $g-2$ measurement, the Standard Model prediction using the data-driven dispersive approach for calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP), and the comparison with lattice QCD calculations.</description>

Abstract: We study the collinear factorization of off-shell scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (sYM) theory. These are constructed starting from six-dimensional N = (1,1) sYM, taking advantage of an available unconstrained spinor-helicity formalism combined with a unitarity-cut sewing procedure. After generalized dimensional reduction, their collinear behavior is dissected with assistance from the Method of Regions. We then construct off-shell splitting amplitudes directly using the same techniques, establishing equivalence to the amplitude analysis. The calculations are performed at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>The cosmic history of Primordial Black Hole accretion and its uncertainties</title>

Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) have not been experimentally detected so far, but their existence would provide important insights about the early Universe and serve as one of the possible candidates of dark matter (DM). In this work, we explore the accretion of radiation and matter by PBHs, with relevance for the growth of PBH seeds to form early Supermassive Black Holes; the emission from accreting PBHs; and constraints from gravitational wave observations, among others. We study the growth of PBH masses in the early Universe due to the accretion of radiation, highlighting uncertainties which arise from estimates of the PBH formation time. For baryonic accretion, we review the traditional Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) and its refined version known as the Park-Ricotti (PR) model, which also includes radiative feedback. We find that in the BHL model, PBHs heavier than $\sim 100 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can grow in mass by several orders of magnitude by $z \lesssim 10$, though only when surrounded by DM halos and only when the accretion efficiency is large. By contrast, the inclusion of radiation feedback in the PR model can drastically suppress the baryonic accretion rate of PBHs, leading to a negligible change in PBH mass over cosmic time. Furthermore our calculations show that the accretion rate depends sensitively on the modelling of various parameters such as the speed of sound in the baryonic gas and the velocity of PBHs. These findings highlight the uncertainties associated with accretion onto PBHs, and we find that a large increase in the PBH mass due to accretion is by no means guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the Sombrero Galaxy as an Accelerator of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the highest energy messenger from space, with energies exceeding 1 EeV. Although UHECRs were discovered over 60 years ago, their origin still remains a mystery. Pinpointing sources of UHECRs is crucial for understanding the extreme astrophysical processes that accelerate particles to such extraordinary energies. We searched for UHECR multiplets via analyzing 17 years of data with energies greater than 40 EeV from the Pierre Auger Observatory. A spatial association is found between a multiplet of $25.7^{+6.2}_{-7.0}$ cosmic rays and the Sombrero galaxy with a local (global) significance of $4.5~\sigma~(3.3~\sigma)$. The Sombrero galaxy hosts a supermassive central black hole with a mass of $\sim1\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$ and exhibits large-scale radio lobes and jets. Our finding provides critical evidence on active supermassive black holes as the source of the highest-energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Non-Radial Oscillation Modes in Hybrid Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons: Full General Relativity Formalism vs. Cowling Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of hyperons, delta baryons, and quark matter phase transitions on f-mode oscillations in neutron stars. Using the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase, we construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) consistent with astrophysical constraints. Including hyperons and delta baryons soften the EoS, reducing maximum masse, while phase transition to the quark matter further softens the EoS, decreasing the speed of sound and hence the maximum mass. f-mode frequencies, calculated using both the Cowling approximation and the general relativistic (GR) frameworks, reveal a significant overestimation by the Cowling method of about 10-30%, with discrepancies decreasing for more massive stars. We derive universal relations connecting the frequencies of the f-mode to the average density, compactness, and tidal deformability, finding significant deviations due to hyperons and delta baryons. Empirical relations for mass-scaled and radius-scaled frequencies are also provided, highlighting the importance of GR calculations for accurate modeling. These findings highlight the potential of gravitational wave asteroseismology to constrain neutron star EoSs and internal structure.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Axions and Associated Relics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fuzzy axion dark matter in type IIB string theory, for axions descending from the Ramond-Ramond four-form in compactifications on orientifolds of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. Such models can be tested by cosmological measurements if a significant relic abundance of fuzzy dark matter arises, which we argue is most common in models with small numbers of axions. We construct a topologically exhaustive ensemble of more than 350,000 Calabi-Yau compactifications yielding up to seven axions, and in this setting we perform a systematic analysis of misalignment production of fuzzy dark matter. In typical regions of moduli space, the fuzzy axion, the QCD axion, and other axions have comparable decay constants of $f_a \approx 10^{16}$ GeV. We find that overproduction of heavier axions is problematic, except at special loci in moduli space where decay constant hierarchies can occur: without a contrived reheating epoch, it is necessary to fine-tune initial displacements. The resulting dark matter is typically a mix of fuzzy axions and heavier axions, including the QCD axion. Dark photons are typically present as a consequence of the orientifold projection. We examine the signatures of these models by simulating halos with multiple fuzzy axions, and by computing new cosmological constraints on ultralight axions and dark radiation. We also give evidence that cosmic birefringence is possible in this setting. Our findings determine the phenomenological correlates of fuzzy axion dark matter in a corner of the landscape.</description>

Abstract: We study a recently identified four-loop Feynman integral that contains a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometry and contributes to the scattering of black holes in classical gravity at fifth post-Minkowskian and second self-force order (5PM 2SF) in the conservative sector. In contrast to previously studied Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals, the higher-order differential equation that this integral satisfies in dimensional regularization exhibits $\varepsilon$-dependent apparent singularities. We introduce an appropriate ansatz which allows us to bring such cases into an $\varepsilon$-factorized form. As a proof of principle, we apply it to the integral at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasino model is modified by the inclusion of a running-coupling that was obtained by a fractal approach to Quantum Chromodynamics. The coupling follows a $q$-exponential function and, in the context of high energy collisions, explains the origin of the Tsallis non-extensive statistics distributions. The parameter $q$ is completely determined in terms of the number of colours and the number of quark flavours. We study several aspects of the extended model and compare our results to the standard NJL model, where a constant coupling is used in combination with a sharp cutoff to regularize the gap equation. We show that the modified coupling regularizes the model in a smooth cutoff fashion and reproduces the pion mass and decay constant, providing an almost identical Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation as in the standard NJL model. In both models the relation is satisfied in similar cutoff scales. An important novelty of this work is the physical explanation, in terms of the fractal QCD vacuum, for a running coupling that renormalizes the quark condensate.</description>

      <title>Conserved charge susceptibilities in the relativistic mean-field hadron resonance gas model: constraints on hadronic repulsive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of repulsive interaction between hadrons on the susceptibilities of conserved charges, namely baryon number (B), electric charge (Q) and strangeness (S). We estimate second fourth and sixth-order susceptibilities of conserved charges, their differences, ratios, and correlations within the ambit of the mean-field hadron resonance gas (MFHRG) model. We consider repulsive mean-field interaction among meson pairs, baryon pairs and anti-baryon pairs separately and constrain them by confronting the results of various susceptibilities with the recent lattice QCD (LQCD) data. We find that the repulsive interactions between baryon-baryon pairs and antibaryon-antibaryon pairs are sufficient to describe the baryon susceptibilities of hadronic matter at temperatures below the QCD transition temperature. However, small but finite mesonic repulsive interaction is needed to describe electric charge and strangeness susceptibilities. We finally conclude that the repulsive interaction between hadrons plays a very important role in describing the thermodynamic properties of hadronic matter, especially near the quark-hadron phase transition temperature ($T_c$). The mean-field parameter for baryons ($K_B$) should be constrained in the range $0.40\le K_B\le 0.450$ $\text{GeV.fm}^{3}$ to get a good agreement of baryon susceptibilities with the LQCD results, whereas meson mean-field parameter $K_M\sim 0.05$ $\text{GeV.fm}^{3}$ must be included with $K_B$ to get a reasonable agreement of the MFHRG model with the LQCD results for electric charge and strangeness susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Reheating and Leptogenesis after Vector inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis in the case of a vector inflaton. We concentrate on particle production during the phase of oscillating background, especially gravitational production induced by the presence of non-minimal coupling imposed by an isotropic and homogeneous Universe. Including processes involving the exchange of graviton, we then extend our study to decay into fermions via direct or anomalous couplings. The necessity of non-minimal gravitational coupling and the gauge nature of couplings to fermions implies a much richer phenomenology than for a scalar inflaton.</description>

      <title>The QCD Axion: Some Like It Hot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the QCD axion phase-space distribution from unitarized next-to-leading order chiral perturbation theory with the one extracted from pion-scattering data. We derive a robust bound by confronting momentum-dependent Boltzmann equations against up-to-date observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and of primordial abundances. These datasets imply $m_{a} \leq \, 0.16 $ eV for the 95% credible interval, i.e. $\sim$30% stronger bound than what previously found. We present forecasts using dedicated likelihoods for future cosmological surveys and the sphaleron rate from unquenched lattice QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal clockwork model to illustrate the possibility of baryogenesis via leptogenesis in a theory space setting. The standard lepton sector is augmented with three copies of a clockwork lattice made of SM neutral fermions. The two boundaries of these one-dimensional lattices are endowed with couplings to the SM leptons and three dark sector fermions, respectively. Small neutrino masses and a resonance enhanced Dirac leptogenesis are naturally obtained for anarchic textures of the Yukawa matrices, with $\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ elements, provided the heavy clockwork fermions have masses $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10 \, \mbox{TeV})$</description>

      <title>New physics search with the new gauge boson $Z'$ of the bestest little Higgs model at the muon collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bestest Little Higgs Model (BLHM) has attracted increasing attention in recent years, mainly because it can explain the hierarchy problem without fine-tuning by introducing one-loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass through heavy top quark partners and heavy gauge bosons. In the context of this new model, we exhaustively investigated the impact of the BLHM parameters on the Higgs-strahlung production processes $\mu^{-} \mu^{+} \to Z'h_0$ and $\mu^{-} \mu^{+} \to Z'H_0$, where $Z'$ and $H_0$ represent a new heavy gauge boson and a new heavy Higgs boson, respectively. We consider the integrated luminosities of ${\cal L}=2000, 20 000$ ${\rm fb^{-1}}$ and the respective center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=3000, 10 000$ GeV projected for a future muon collider to estimate the number of expected Higgs boson production events $h_0$ or $H_0$ in association with a new gauge boson $Z'$ at the muon collider. In addition, we derive and present the Feynman rules for scalars ($h_0, H_0, \phi^{0}, \eta^{0}, \sigma, H^{\pm}, \phi^{\pm}, \eta^{\pm}, A_0$) and include the self-interactions of Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>SN1987A constraints to BSM models with extra neutral bosons near the trapping regime: $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model as an illustrative example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) with an extra neutral boson can be constrained from the observation of SN1987A, since the production of this neutral boson in a supernova (SN) could accelerate the SN cooling and potentially lead to a period of the neutrino burst incompatible with the observation. The constraint to the model is formulated by the condition $L_{\rm NB}\leq 3\times 10^{52}$ erg/s according to G. Raffelt with $L_{\rm NB}$ the luminosity of BSM neutral boson. Computing the above luminosity in the large coupling case, the so-called trapping regime, is non-trivial since the luminosity is a competition between the large production rate and the efficient absorption or decay rate of the neutral boson. We illustrate such a subtlety using $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model as an example where the $Z^{\prime}$ luminosity, $L_{Z^{\prime}}$, from the neutrinosphere is calculated.
  We calculate $Z'$ production, absorption, and decay rates through pair-coalescence, semi-Compton, loop-bremsstrahlung from proton-neutron scattering, and their inverse processes in a benchmark SN simulation with muons. We point out that, as the coupling constant $g_{Z'}$ increases, $L_{Z^{\prime}}$ shall be approaching a constant plateau value for a given $m_{Z'}$ instead of monotonically decreasing down to zero as obtained in the previous literature. We demonstrate that this plateau phenomenon can be understood by physical arguments and justified by numerical calculations. With a different result on $L_{Z^{\prime}}$ from the previous one, we discuss impacts on the constraints to $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ parameter space by SN1987A. The implication of our result to the similar constraint on a generic BSM model with an extra neutral boson is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Strategy to measure tau $g-2$ via photon fusion in LHC proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the tau-lepton ($\tau$) anomalous magnetic moment $a_\tau = (g_\tau -2)/2$ in photon fusion production ($\gamma\gamma\to\tau\tau$) tests foundational Standard Model principles. However, $\gamma\gamma\to\tau\tau$ eludes observation in LHC proton collisions (pp) despite enhanced new physics sensitivity from higher-mass reach than existing probes. We propose a novel strategy to measure $\text{pp} \to \text{p}(\gamma\gamma\to\tau\tau)\text{p}$ by introducing the overlooked electron-muon signature with vertex isolation for signal extraction. Applying the effective field theory of dipole moments, we estimate 95% CL sensitivity of $-0.0092 &lt; a_\tau &lt; 0.011$ assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity and 5% systematics. This fourfold improvement beyond existing constraints opens a crucial path to unveiling new physics imprinted in tau-lepton dipoles.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in a number of current experiments. We study dark matter using the $U(1)_X$SSM obtained from the $U(1)_X$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we use the right-handed neutrino as a dark matter candidate, whose lightest mass eigenstate has cold dark matter features. In this paper, the relic density of right-handed neutrino as dark matter is investigated. For dark matter scattering, both spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections are studied. In the final numerical results obtained, some parameter spaces can satisfy the constraints of the relic density and dark matter direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Celestial Bodies for Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide variety of celestial bodies have been considered as dark matter detectors. Which stands the best chance of delivering the discovery of dark matter? Which is the most powerful dark matter detector? We investigate a range of objects, including the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, Brown Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, Stellar populations, and Exoplanets. We quantify how different objects are optimal dark matter detectors in different regimes by deconstructing some of the in-built assumptions in these search sensitivities, including observation potential and particle model assumptions. We find new constraints and future sensitivities across a range of dark matter annihilation final states. We quantify mediator properties leading to detectable celestial-body energy injection or Standard Model fluxes, and show how different objects can be expected to deliver corroborating signals. We discuss different search strategies, their opportunities and limitations, and the interplay of regimes where different celestial objects are optimal dark matter detectors. Deconstructing the assumptions of these searches leads us to point out a new search using the Galactic center stellar population that can provide greater sensitivity to the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section than the Sun, despite being significantly further away in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC: Natural stability from fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the muon magnetic dipole moment (MDM) has close relation with the new physics (NP) in the development of the Standard Model (SM). Combined with the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) E821 result, the departure from the SM prediction is about 5.0 $\sigma$. We study the electroweak corrections from several type two-loop SUSY diagrams and the virtual SUSY particles include chargino, neutralino, scalar lepton and scalar neutrino. Based on the latest experimental constraints, we study the muon anomalous MDM under the next to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry (N-B-LSSM). The abundant numerical results verify that $\tan{\beta},~T_e,~M^2_L,~M^2_e,~M_{BB'}$ play an important role in muon anomalous MDM. $M^2_e,~\tan{\beta}$ and $T_e$ are sensitive parameters to muon anomalous MDM. From the data obtained in all the figures of the numerical results, most of the values of $a_{\mu}^{NBL}$ are in 2$\sigma$ interval, which can compensate the departure between the experiment data and the SM prediction.</description>

Abstract: We present an analysis of the lepton-flavor violating decay of the Higgs boson mediated by an ultralight gauge boson, $\chi$. Our analysis matches a model generating the lepton flavor-violating interaction $\bar{\ell}_i\ell_j\chi$ at tree level with an effective field theory, safeguarding a physical massless $\chi$-boson limit of the observables. By utilizing the upper bounds on $H\to\ell_i \bar\ell_j$ decays from CMS and ATLAS Collaborations, we establish an indirect upper limit on the nonstandard decay $H\to\ell_i \bar\ell_j\chi$. The analysis encompasses various observables such as the lepton energy spectrum, Dalitz plot distribution, and Lepton Charge and Forward-Backward Asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous CP Breaking in a QCD-like Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the phase structure of a QCD-like theory at $\bar\theta =\pi$ obtained from supersymmetric $SU(N)$ QCD perturbed by a small amount of supersymmetry breaking via anomaly mediation (AMSB QCD). The spectrum of this theory matches that of QCD at the massless level, though the superpartners are not decoupled. In this theory it is possible to nail down the phase structure at $\bar\theta=\pi$ as a function of the quark masses and the number of flavors $F$. For one flavor we find that there is a critical quark mass, below which CP is unbroken, while above the critical mass CP is spontaneously broken. At the critical mass there is a second-order phase transition along with a massless $\eta'$. We are able to analytically solve for the minima and the critical mass for $N=2,3$ as well as for the large $N$ limit, while for other $N$ one can find numerical results. For two flavors, we find that CP is always broken as long as the quark masses are equal and non-zero, however there is a non-trivial phase boundary for unequal quark masses, which we find numerically. For $F\geq 3$ we obtain an intricate phase boundary which reproduces the various quark mass limits. All our results are in agreement with the predictions for ordinary QCD that were based on anomaly matching arguments for generalized symmetries and the effective chiral Lagrangian. We also briefly comment on the domain wall solutions first discussed by Draper, and are able to present analytic results for the simplest case of $SU(2)$ with one flavor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss modular family symmetry in effective theories based on generic properties of bottom-up local F-theory inspired GUTs broken by fluxes, which we refer to as Fluxed GUTs. We argue that the Yukawa couplings will depend on the complex structure moduli of the matter curves in such a way that they can be modular forms associated with these symmetries. To illustrate the approach we analyse in detail a concrete local fluxed $SU(5)$ GUT with modular $S_4$ family symmetry.</description>

      <title>Recoil electron polarization-dependent T-odd correlations in neutrino elastic scattering on polarized electron target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Possible symmetry breaking tests with respect to the time inversion in the elastic scattering of neutrinos on polarized electrons are considered, assuming that the incoming neutrino beam is either longitudinally or transversely polarized, and both momentum and polarization of recoil electrons are observed.
  In the process, in addition to the standard interaction, the exotic scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor interactions can participate. Due to the nonstandard interactions, different types of triple T-odd products in the cross section may appear. We consider several experiments in which mixed products built of the recoil electron polarization and two other vector quantities (incoming neutrino momentum, its polarization, polarization of the electron target and outgoing electron momentum) can be identified.
  Observations of the T-odd correlations may indicate noninvariance under time reversal as well as the presence of exotic interactions. A complete analysis of the problem requires a precise determination of the possible contributions from the interactions mimicking the genuine violation of time reversal symmetry, e.g. final state interactions.</description>

      <title>$\eta_{c2}(^1D_2)$ and its electromagnetic decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-singlet state $\eta_{c2}(^1D_2)$ has not been discovered in experiment and it is the only missing low-excited $D$-wave charmonium, so in this paper, we like to study its properties. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation method, we obtain its mass as $3828.2$ MeV and its electromagnetic decay widths as $\Gamma[\eta_{c2}(1D)\rightarrow h_{c}(1P)\gamma]=284$ keV, $\Gamma[\eta_{c2}(1D)\rightarrow J/\psi\gamma]=1.04$ keV, $\Gamma[\eta_{c2}(1D)\rightarrow\psi(2S)\gamma]=3.08$ eV, and $\Gamma[\eta_{c2}(1D)\rightarrow\psi(3770)\gamma]=0.143$ keV. {Considering the strong decay widths are estimated to be $\Gamma(\eta_{c2}(1D)\to\eta_c \pi\pi)=144~\rm{keV}$ and $\Gamma(\eta_{c2}(1D)\to gg)= 46.1~\rm{keV}$, we obtain the total decay width of $475$ keV for $\eta_{c2}(1D)$, and point out that the full width is very sensitive to the mass $M_{\eta_{c2}}$.} In our calculation, the emphasis is put on the relativistic corrections. Our results show that $\eta_{c2}\rightarrow h_{c}\gamma$ is the nonrelativistic $E1$ transition dominated $E1+M2+E3$ decay, and $\eta_{c2}\rightarrow \psi\gamma$ is the $M1+E2+M3+E4$ decay but the relativistic $E2$ transition contributes the most.</description>

      <title>Modelling the underlying event in photon-initiated processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling the underlying event in high-energy hadronic collisions is important for physics at colliders. This includes lepton colliders, where low-virtuality photons accompanying the lepton beam(s) may develop hadronic structure. Similarly, photon-induced collisions also occur in proton or heavy-ion beam experiments. While the underlying event in proton-proton collisions has been the subject of much study at the LHC, studies of hadronic-photon-induced underlying event are now of increasing interest in light of planned future lepton and lepton-hadron colliders, as well as the photon-induced processes in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC. Here we present an investigation of the underlying event in photon-initiated processes, starting from the PYTHIA models used to describe LHC and Tevatron data, and revisiting HERA and LEP2 data. While no single tune describes all the data with different beam configurations, we find that a good agreement can still be found within the same model by adjusting the relevant parameters separately for $\gamma\gamma$, $\gamma p$ and $pp$. This suggests that the basic model of multiparton interaction implemented in PYTHIA can be applied for different beam configurations. Furthermore, we find that a reasonable agreement for $\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma p$ data, and for $pp$ data at an LHC reference energy, can be found within a single parametrization, but $pp$ collisions would prefer a stronger energy dependence, leading to too many multiparton interactions in lower energy photon-induced collisions. On this basis, we make some recommendations for simulations of photon-induced processes, such as $\gamma \gamma$ events at the LHC or FCC and $ep$ or $eA$ collisions at the EIC, and suggest possibilities for improvements in the modelling.</description>

Abstract: General expressions for one-loop contributions associated with lepton-flavor violating decays of the standard model-like Higgs boson $h\to e_b^\pm e_a^\mp$ and gauge boson $Z\to e^\pm_b e_a^\mp$ are introduced in the unitary gauge. The results are used to discuss these decays as new physics signals in a minimal left-right symmetric model containing only one bidoublet Higgs and a $SU(2)_R$ Higgs doublet accommodating data of neutrino oscillations and $(g-2)_{\mu}$. The numerical investigation indicates that some of these decay rates can reach near future experimental sensitivities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the potential of general Higgs multiplets. We establish the domain of general Higgs multiplets within the context of the adjoint representation. The construction of the most general potential for arbitrary multiplets is achieved using the irreducible, totally symmetric representation of tensor products of doublets. Furthermore, we explore symmetry transformations of the Higgs multiplets, with particular emphasis on CP symmetries.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Deconvolution with Profiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many experimental contexts, it is necessary to statistically remove the impact of instrumental effects in order to physically interpret measurements. This task has been extensively studied in particle physics, where the deconvolution task is called unfolding. A number of recent methods have shown how to perform high-dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning. However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector response is correctly modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold, which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold algorithm while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept highlighting its promising capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Collinear emission of $W$ bosons off a high-energy muon induces a large muon-neutrino component among the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of a muon. In this paper we study the phenomenology related to the $\nu_\mu$ PDF at future high-energy muon colliders. We examine total rates and differential distributions of the $e \bar{\nu}_e$ and $W \gamma$ production processes, which receive a large, and often dominant, contribution from this PDF, allowing for a detailed experimental study. As a demonstration of the impact the $\nu_\mu$ PDF could have for searches of new physics, we study the charged-current pair production of a couple of heavy states, components of a ${\rm SU}(2)_L$ doublet. In both $e\bar{\nu}_e$ production and charged-current pair production of heavy states, we compare results obtained using PDFs with those of a fixed-order simulation.</description>

Abstract: In the present work we investigate the mass spectrum and semileptonic decays of double charm and bottom baryon states using the hypercentral quark model. We solve the six-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation via deep learning and particle swarm optimization techniques to improve the speed and accuracy. Then, we predict the masses of the ground and excited states of single and doubly heavy baryons. Working close to the zero recoil point, we also study the semileptonic decay widths and branching ratios of doubly heavy $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ baryons for the $b\rightarrow c$ transitions. A comparison between our results and the evaluations of other theoretical models is also presented. Our predictions of mass spectrum and decay widths provide valuable information for the experiment searching for undiscovered heavy baryon states.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Photons with energy half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The production and decay of $X_0(2900)$ state with different interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of $X_0(2900)$ in $B^+\rightarrow D^+D^-K^+$ decay process indicates the existence of open flavor tetraquark states. We study the production and decay of $X_0(2900)$ state with final state interaction mechanism, where we calculate the strong vertices such as $g_{\bar{D}KX_0}$, $g_{\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast X_0}$, $g_{D_s^{\ast}\bar{D}K}$ and $g_{D_{s1}\bar{D} K^\ast}$ in the framework of QCD sum rules method. We find that for the interpretation of the $\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast$ molecule of $X_0(2900)$, the branching fraction of the production process and the decay width are consistent with the experimental results, indicating that the observed $X_0(2900)$ could be interpreted as the $\bar{D}^\ast K^\ast$ molecule. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a compact tetraquark interpretation within the uncertainty. Further experimental and theoretical efforts should be made to fully understand the nature of the $X_0(2900)$ state.</description>

Abstract: A discrepancy of approximately 5$\sigma$ exists between the two known results for the tenth-order QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, calculated from Feynman vertex diagrams without fermion loops. To investigate this, we decomposed this contribution into 389 parts based on a self-energy diagram representation, enabling a diagram-by-diagram numerical comparison of the two calculations. No significant discrepancies were found for individual diagrams. However, the numerical differences of the 98 diagrams sharing a common structure were not randomly distributed. The accumulation of these differences resulted in the 5$\sigma$ discrepancy. A recalculation with increased statistics in the Monte Carlo integration was performed for these 98 diagrams, resolving the discrepancy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron spectrum exhibits a complex structure and has controversially proposed origins. This work reproduce the evolution of the electron spectrum based on a spatially dependent propagation (SDP) model. The key point is that our SPD model features two diffusion regions leading to two diffusion timescales, competing with the cooling timescale. This results in a three-segment power-law electron spectrum: (1) The spectrum below tens of GeV is primarily influenced by cooling effects from distant sources. (2) The spectrum dominated by diffusion effects from nearby sources from tens of GeV to TeV. (3) The spectrum above TeV, which is predominantly governed by cooling effects from nearby sources. This evolution is unique to the SDP model, and we offer a comprehensive and clear depiction of electron evolution under a single propagation scenario for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a $D$-wave partner of $\psi(3770)$ identified by the LHCb Collaboration, $\psi_3(3842)$ lies between the $D\bar{D}$ and $D\bar{D^*}$ thresholds. Its non-$D\bar{D}$ decay channels have attracted considerable interest. In this study, we investigate these allowed non-$D\bar{D}$ decays of $\psi_3(3842)$ into $PP$, $PV$, and $VV$ final states using the hadronic loop mechanism, where $P$ and $V$ represent light pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Our results suggest that these non-$D\bar{D}$ decays of $\psi_3(3842)$ can be significant, with contributions primarily driven by hadronic loops. Notably, the $\rho\pi$ channel stands out as the main non-$D\bar{D}$ decay mode, while non-$D\bar{D}$ decay channels involving strange mesons are also sizable. These predictions could be tested in future experiments such as those at LHCb and BESIII.</description>

      <title>Event-by-event Comparison between Machine-Learning- and Transfer-Matrix-based Unfolding Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unfolding of detector effects is a key aspect of comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions. In recent years, different Machine-Learning methods have been developed to provide novel features, e.g. high dimensionality or a probabilistic single-event unfolding based on generative neural networks. Traditionally, many analyses unfold detector effects using transfer-matrix--based algorithms, which are well established in low-dimensional unfolding. They yield an unfolded distribution of the total spectrum, together with its covariance matrix. This paper proposes a method to obtain probabilistic single-event unfolded distributions, together with their uncertainties and correlations, for the transfer-matrix--based unfolding. The algorithm is first validated on a toy model and then applied to pseudo-data for the $pp\rightarrow Z\gamma \gamma$ process. In both examples the performance is compared to the Machine-Learning--based single-event unfolding using an iterative approach with conditional invertible neural networks (IcINN).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong longitudinal expansion characteristic of heavy-ion collisions leads to universal attractor behavior of the resulting drop of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) already at very early times. Assuming approximate boost invariance and neglecting transverse expansion at the initial time, we incorporate subsequent transverse dynamics of this system by linearizing the Mueller-Israel-Stewart theory around the transversely homogeneous attractor. The result is a system of coupled ordinary differential equations which describes the proper-time evolution of Fourier modes encoding the transverse structure of the initial energy deposition. The late-time asymptotic behavior of these solutions is described by transseries which make manifest the stability of the attractor against transverse perturbations. In this framework, information about the structure of the plasma in the transverse plane resides mostly in exponentially suppressed corrections to evolution along the attractor, which are not yet negligible at freeze-out. These findings also suggest a simple numerical approach to QGP dynamics using a finite number of Fourier modes. Physical observables can be expressed in terms of the asymptotic data evaluated at freeze-out. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by calculating the final multiplicity distributions and collective flow coefficients.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Dynamical Scalars: Tracking Solutions and the Possibility of a Stasis-Induced Inflation</title>

Abstract: It has recently been realized that many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model give rise to cosmological histories exhibiting extended epochs of cosmological stasis. During such epochs, the abundances of different energy components such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy each remain fixed despite cosmological expansion. In previous analyses of the stasis phenomenon, these different energy components were modeled as fluids with fixed, unchanging equations of state. In this paper, by contrast, we consider more realistic systems involving dynamical scalars which pass through underdamping transitions as the universe expands. Indeed, such systems might be highly relevant for BSM scenarios involving higher-dimensional bulk moduli and inflatons. Remarkably, we find that stasis emerges even in such situations, despite the appearance of time-varying equations of state. Moreover, this stasis includes several new features which might have important phenomenological implications and applications. For example, in the presence of an additional "background" energy component, we find that the scalars evolve into a "tracking" stasis in which the stasis equation of state automatically tracks that of the background. This phenomenon exists even if the background has only a small initial abundance. We also discuss the intriguing possibility that our results might form the basis of a new "Stasis Inflation" scenario in which no ad-hoc inflaton potential is needed and in which there is no graceful-exit problem. Within such a scenario, the number of e-folds of cosmological expansion produced is directly related to the hierarchies between physical BSM mass scales. Moreover, non-zero matter and radiation abundances can be sustained throughout the inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Proving the absence of large one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation within the path-integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations $\zeta$ in an inflationary scenario containing a transient ultra-slow-roll (USR) period. In Ref.[1], it was argued that one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of $\zeta$ can be larger than the tree-level one within the parameter region generating the seeds of primordial black holes during the USR epoch, which implies the breakdown of perturbation theory. We prove that this is not the case by using a master formula for one-loop corrections to the power spectrum obtained in Ref.[2]. We derive the same formula within the path-integral formalism, which is simpler than the original derivation in [2]. To show the smallness of one-loop corrections, the consistency relations and the effective constancy of tree-level mode functions of $\zeta$ for super-Hubble modes play essential roles, with which the master formula gives a simple expression for one-loop corrections. For concreteness, we provide a reduced set of interactions including the leading-order one, while establishing the consistency relations in a self-consistent manner. We also show how the consistency relations of various operators hold explicitly, which plays a key role in proving the absence of large one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from a Single Annihilating Particle Species: Extending Stasis Into the Thermal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extended cosmological epochs can exist during which the abundances associated with different energy components remain constant despite cosmological expansion. Indeed, this "stasis" behavior has been found to arise generically in many BSM theories containing large towers of states, and even serves as a cosmological attractor. However, all previous studies of stasis took place within non-thermal environments, or more specifically within environments in which thermal effects played no essential role in realizing or sustaining the stasis. In this paper, we demonstrate that stasis can emerge and serve as an attractor even within thermal environments, with thermal effects playing a critical role in the stasis dynamics. Moreover, within such environments, we find that no towers of states are needed -- a single state experiencing two-body annihilations will suffice. This work thus extends the stasis phenomenon into the thermal domain and demonstrates that thermal effects can also generally give rise to an extended stasis epoch, even when only a single matter species is involved.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Hypothetical Lorentz invariance violation and the muon content of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensive air showers (EAS), produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, serve as probes of particle interactions, providing access to energies and kinematical regimes beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. Measurements from multiple cosmic-ray detectors indicate a significant, yet unexplained, discrepancy between the observed muon content in EAS and that predicted by state-of-the-art interaction models, suggesting a need for refinements in our understanding of fundamental physics. Here we show that a tiny, experimentally allowed, violation of the Lorentz invariance (LIV) may result in the suppression of the number of electrons in EAS, leaving the muon number intact and explaining both the ''muon excess'' and its energy dependence. On the other hand, we use the lack of a much stronger discrepancy between EAS data and simulations to obtain strict constraints on the LIV scale. Future experimental tests of this LIV scenario are outlined.</description>
