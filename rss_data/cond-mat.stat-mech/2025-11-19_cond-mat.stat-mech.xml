      <title>Numerical analysis of heat transport in classical one-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical studies of some unidimensional systems provide evidence of finite thermal conductivity, where theory predicts a divergence with the system size. Some models are here reviewed under the working hypothesis that the energy flux across a nonequilibrium stationary state may be the sum of two contributions: the former responsible for normal conductivity, the latter accounting for the anomalous component. I conclude that in the thermodynamic limit, the diverging component is indeed present, although the crossover to a regime dominated by the anomalous component may occur at extremely long system sizes.
  Finally, I study a variant of the ding-a-ling model, previously claimed to satisfy Fourier law, showing that it too exhibits a diverging conductivity in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Hybrid ab initio and empirical machine learning models for the potential energy surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to generate hybrid machine learning models for the potential energy surface trained simultaneously on data from ab initio electronic structure calculations and on thermodynamic and/or structural observables from experiment. The approach is based on the use of a loss function that includes the mean square error of observables with respect to their experimental values, in addition to the usual terms involving the mean square error of the energies and forces with respect to ab initio data. We employ a reweighting procedure that allows for the calculation of ensemble averages of observables during training for arbitrary values of the model parameters and on the fly. The method is general and can be applied to any set of static observables. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to the generation of hybrid models for liquid water that reproduce accurately the experimental density maximum, the density isobar at 1 bar, and the radial distribution function in molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced transition in heat conduction through a topological metamaterial of rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of rigid rotors. The rotors are constrained to rotate in a plane about fixed pivot points and coupled by springs, such that in equilibrium, the neighboring rotors lie on opposite sides of the chain axis. The linearized limit of this model valid for small angular displacements, was first introduced by Kane and Lubensky (KL) as a topological mechanical insulator hosting zero-energy vibrational edge modes. We show that the linearized KL chain behaves as a thermal insulator at low temperature in both the topological phases with a finite band gap, and the heat current falls exponentially with the chain length. When the gap vanishes at the topological phase transition, the KL chain becomes a good thermal conductor and conducts heat ballistically. The chain of rotors for arbitrary angular displacements hosts nonlinear solitary waves and distinct topological mechanical phases. Our numerical analysis shows normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases of the nonlinear chain. Nevertheless, a finite thermal conductivity is achieved for different system sizes in different topological phases of this nonlinear chain.</description>

      <title>Search by Return: Stochastic Resetting in Fluctuating Harmonic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic resetting (SR) processes in which a diffusing particle alternates between free motion and confinement by an externally controlled potential. When the particle is recaptured, it undergoes a return trajectory that drives it toward a designated reset point. In standard SR, such returns are treated as instantaneous, but in realistic setups they have finite duration and introduce imprecision in the starting points of subsequent search attempts. We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs). Of particular interest is a protocol in which outward diffusion is eliminated entirely and the return motion itself becomes the search mechanism. This "search by return" perspective reverses the conventional logic of SR and yields a closed-form MFPT that highlights the efficiency of using return dynamics as the primary search strategy.</description>

      <title>Compensating random transition-detection blackouts in Markov networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Markov networks, measurement blackouts with unknown frequency compromise observations such that thermodynamic quantities can no longer be inferred reliably. In particular, the observed currents neither discern equilibrium from non-equilibrium nor can they be used in extant estimators of entropy production. Our strategy to eliminate these effects is based on formally attributing the blackouts to a second channel connecting states. The unknown frequency of blackouts and the true underlying transition rates can be determined from the short-time limit of observed waiting-time distributions. A post-modification of observed trajectory data yields a virtual effective dynamics from which the lower bound on entropy production based on thermodynamic uncertainty relations can be recovered fully. Moreover, the post-processed data can be used in waiting-time based estimators. Crucially, our strategy does neither require the blackouts to occur homogeneously nor symmetrically under time-reversal.</description>

      <title>On the Modified Eguchi-Oki-Matsumura System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe the simultaneous order-disorder transformation and phase separation Eguchi, Oki and Matsumura [\doi{10.1557/proc-21-589}] introduced the system of two equations: one equation, governing the evolution of a conserved order parameter, and the second equation for the non-conserved order parameter. The key feature of their model is the free energy functional, which contains the square gradient terms of the both order parameters and a fourth power polynomial depending on both order parameters. According to the general Hohenberg-Halperin classification it is the type C model. We show that if the dynamics of the conserved order parameter is governed by the convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, this system allows exact traveling wave solution.</description>

      <title>Realizing Unitary $k$-designs with a Single Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible defects in generalized Ising models via strange correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.</description>

      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Spin-singlet dimer phase in a frustrated square lattice under a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an anisotropic square lattice with competing exchange interactions, motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6. Using a cluster mean-field approach, we explore a field-induced phase stabilized by the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations, focusing on the role of exchange interactions. We identify: (i) the formation of spin singlet pairs, signaled by enhanced spin-spin correlations in specific field regimes; and (ii) a one-half magnetization plateau, emerging from a subtle balance between competing exchange couplings and field-enhanced quantum fluctuations. Our results reveal that an enhancement of frustration, achieved by tuning small variations in the spatially anisotropic exchange interactions of the compound (o-MePy-V)PF6, can stabilize a field-induced quantum phase where ferromagnetism coexists with antiferromagnetic dimers. Our results provide microscopic insight into the mechanisms driving these nontrivial phases and offer theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in this class of low-dimensional quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Social Imitation beyond Energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of stochastic thermodynamics during the last decades prompted the discovery of novel nonequilibrium relations refining our understanding of the second law in small fluctuating systems and its connection with information theory. A fundamental open question is whether these powerful tools can illuminate other areas of complex systems, such as social phenomena, where energy plays no fundamental role. Here we develop a framework that derives a ``second law" for social systems. Similarly to Landauer's principle, it constrains spontaneous changes in agent attributes (opinions, cultural traits, etc.) and their informational entropy. We apply this framework to toy agent-based models of social imitation with non-trivial phase diagrams. We demonstrate how cornerstone results -- fluctuation theorems, kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and second-law-like inequalities -- emerge naturally in this context, even across symmetry-breaking transitions. These results reveal fundamental trade-offs in opinion currents arising from the competition between herding and anti-conformity. Moreover, they provide inference tools to extract model parameters from observations of stochastic changes in agents.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest and next-to-nearest interactions on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transitions of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest $J_1$ and next-to-nearest $J_2$ interactions on the triangular lattice for $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0. The method of supervised neural networks (NN) is employed for the investigation. While supervised NN is used, no real spin configurations are needed for the training. In addition, two kinds of configurations having their spins be arranged in a staggered pattern are considered as the training set. Remarkably, with this unconventional training strategy, not only the critical temperatures of the studied $J_2/J_1$ are computed accurately by the resulting NN, but also the nature of the investigated phase transitions are determined correctly. Specifically, the phase transitions associated with $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0 are first order. These conclusions are consistent with the known results obtained by other methods. Since the training strategy is simple, the NN calculations is highly efficient. It remains to examine whether the unconventional training approach considered in this study can be used to investigate other models with untypical phase transitions or with nontrivial ground state configurations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of entanglement asymmetry for space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement asymmetry for the space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with an on-site energy imbalance between the two sublattices. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction.</description>

      <title>Stationary inverse-Wishart polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solvable model of directed polymer with matrix-valued disorder is introduced in arXiv:2203.14868. The disorder is made of $d\times d$ inverse-Wishart random matrices, so that the model nicely generalizes the well-studied log-gamma polymer, recovered when $d=1$. Much of the features of the log-gamma polymer seem to have analogues for higher $d$, although the integrability needs to be better understood. In this paper, we introduce stationary inverse-Wishart polymer models on a quadrant or a strip of $\mathbb Z^2$. In each setting, we identify stationary measures, characterized explicitly in terms of random walks with inverse-Wishart increments in special cases, or more complicated two-layer Gibbs measures for generic choices of boundary parameters. We also make conjectures about asymptotics of the free energy, and explain important differences between matrix-valued polymer models and their scalar counterpart, due to non-commutativity.</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of shear localization in amorphous solids confined by Couette geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Couette geometry'' refers to two concentric rings in 2-dimensions (or cylinders in 3-dimensions with a medium in between. Typically the inner and outer rings (or cylinders) rotate at different rates and the response of the medium is studied. Here we study a medium which is a twodimensional amorphous solid, and we rotate the inner ring quasi-statically. As stress accumulates, plastic avalanches can result in shear localization, characterized by adjacent parts of the system rotating in opposite directions, with the maximum shear localized between them. We derive an analytic theory that describes and explains the shear localization, providing a-priori predictions for the displacement field associated with the plastic drops and the shear localization.</description>

Abstract: In tensor-network analysis of quantum many-body systems, it is of crucial importance to employ a tensor network with a spatial structure suitable for representing the state of interest. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed a structural optimization algorithm for tree-tensor networks. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.</description>

Abstract: Angular momentum conservation influences equilibrium statistical mechanics, leading to a generalized microcanonical density for an isolated system and a generalized Gibbs density for a weakly coupled system. We study the stochastic decay of angular momentum due to weakly imperfect rotational symmetry of the external potential that confines the isolated many-particle system. We present a mesoscopic description of the system, deriving Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations, which are consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics when rotational symmetry is maintained. When the symmetry is weakly violated, we formulate a coarse-grained stochastic differential equation governing the decay of total angular momentum over time. To validate our analytical predictions, we conduct numerical simulations of the microcanonical ensemble, an isolated system undergoing thermalization due to weak two-body interactions. Our coarse-grained Langevin equation accurately characterizes both the decay of the angular momentum and its fluctuations in a steady state. Furthermore, we estimate the parameters of our mesoscopic model directly from simulations, providing insights into the dissipative phenomenological coefficients, such as friction. More generally, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the integrals of motion when the corresponding symmetry is weakly violated.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Domain Adaptation in Spin Models with Continuous Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main question raised in the article is whether a neural network trained on a spin lattice model in one universality class can be used to test a model in another universality class. The quantities of interest are the critical phase transition temperature and the correlation length exponent. In other words, the question of transfer learning is how ``universal'' the trained network is and under what conditions. For this purpose, we applied a supervised learning procedure to three two-dimensional models for which critical properties are precisely known: the Ising model, the four-state Potts model, and the Baxter-Wu model. We consider two datasets: one with spins configurations and one with binding energy configurations. We find that estimates of the critical temperature agree well with the known results for both datasets, but not with the results of cross-testing using the energy datasets of the two models: the four-state Potts model and the Ising model. Estimates of the critical length exponent are less regular, and appear to be more accurate for energy datasets. A good example is the cross-testing using the energy dataset between Ising model and Baxter-Wu model in both training and testing directions.12</description>

      <title>System-Bath Approach to Rotating Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating equilibrated systems are widespread, but relatively little attention has been devoted to studying them from the first principles of statistical mechanics. We fill this gap by studying a Brownian particle coupled with a thermal bath made of rotating harmonic oscillators. We show that the Langevin equation that describes the dynamics of the Brownian particle contains (due to rotation) long-range correlated noise. In contrast to the usual situation of (non-rotating) equilibration, the rotating Gibbs distribution is recovered only for a weak coupling with the bath. In the presence of a uniform magnetic field, the stationary state is not Gibbsian, even under weak coupling. In this context, we clarify the applicability of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem to classical systems in rotating equilibrium, as well as the concept of work done by a changing magnetic field. We show that the Brownian particle under a rotationally symmetric potential reaches a stationary state that behaves as an effective equilibrium, characterized by a free energy. As a result, no work can be extracted via cyclic processes that respect the rotation symmetry. However, if the external potential exhibits asymmetry, then work extraction via slow cyclic processes is possible. This is illustrated by a general scenario involving a slow rotation of a non-rotation-symmetric potential. We study sedimentation equilibrium and show that centrifugal instability is prevented by a finite friction.</description>

Abstract: We study the correlation function of the one-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization. Focusing on the scaling limit close to the zero-temperature fixed point, we show that this correlation function, in momentum space, exhibits surprising oscillations as a function of the magnetization. We show that these oscillations have a period inversely proportional to the momentum and give an interpretation in terms of domain walls. This is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the correlation function in constant magnetic fields, and sheds light on recent results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for the correlation functions of the critical two-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that stochastically driven nonequilibrium conserved growth models admit generic strong coupling phases for sufficiently strong nonlocal chemical potentials underlying the dynamics. The models exhibit generic roughening transitions between perturbatively accessible weak coupling phases satisfying an exact relation between the scaling exponents in all dimensions $d$, and strong coupling phases. In dimensions below the critical dimension $d_c$, the latter phases are unstable and argued to be crumpled, and thus distinct from the well-known strong coupling rough phase of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in dimensions $d\geq 2$. At $d_c$, conventional spatio-temporal scaling in the weak coupling phase is logarithmically modulated and are exactly obtained.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian reverse engineering for general non-equilibrium steady states: A scalable null-space approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of open system dynamics is of paramount importance both from its fundamental aspects as well as from its potential applications in quantum technologies. In the simpler and most commonly studied case, the dynamics of the system can be described by a Lindblad master equation. However, identifying the Lindbladian that leads to general non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is usually a non-trivial and challenging task. Here we introduce a method for reconstructing the corresponding Lindbaldian master equation given any target NESS, i.e., a \textit{Lindbladian Reverse Engineering} ($\mathcal{L}$RE) approach. The method maps the reconstruction task to a simple linear problem. Specifically, to the diagonalization of a correlation matrix whose elements are NESS observables and whose size scales linearly (at most quadratically) with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian (Lindblad jump operator) ansatz. The kernel (null-space) of the correlation matrix corresponds to Lindbladian solutions. Moreover, the map defines an iff condition for $\mathcal{L}$RE, which works as both a necessary and a sufficient condition; thus, it not only defines, if possible, Lindbladian evolutions leading to the target NESS, but also determines the feasibility of such evolutions in a proposed setup. We illustrate the method in different systems, ranging from bosonic Gaussian systems, dissipative-driven collective spins and random local spin models.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms, hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

Abstract: The open XXZ spin chain with the anisotropy parameter $\Delta=-\frac12$, diagonal boundary fields that depend on a parameter $x$, and finite length $N$ is studied. In a natural normalisation, the components of its ground-state vector are polynomials in $x$ with integer coefficients. It is shown that their sum is given by a generating function for the weighted enumeration of totally-symmetric alternating sign matrices with weights depending on $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prof. Bonitz and his collaborators have made seminal contributions to the study of the uniform electron fluid and the electron-proton fluid, viz., hydrogen, in using {\it ab initio} simulations, as reflected in this festschrift. Here we review the theoretical methods available for these systems where traditional small-parameter methods fail. We use the neutral-pseudo atom (NPA) method, and a classical map for quantum electrons to study hydrogen plasmas. We show that {\it both} fully-ionized and partially-ionized hydrogen phases can exist with the same nominal density and temperature, at pressures and temperatures of interest to planetary physics. The mean ionization $\bar{Z}$, pair-distribution functions, free energies, pressures and conductivities are calculated for the competing phases. Here $\bar{Z}$ is also a measure of the miscibility of fully ionized and un-ionized hydrogen. Recent studies using path-integral Monte Carlo methods, and $N$-atom Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have provided essential structure data including the electron-electron structure factor $S_{ee}(k)$ that enters into interpretation of X-ray Thomson scattering and other diagnostics. We show that these structure data can be inexpensively evaluated using classical-map schemes for fully ionized plasmas, and more generally, using one-atom (average-atom) DFT methods for partially ionized systems.</description>

Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</description>
