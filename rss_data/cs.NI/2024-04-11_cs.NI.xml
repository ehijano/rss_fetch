      <title>Evolving Military Broadband Wireless Communication Systems: WiMAX, LTE and WLAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging technologies for mobile broadband wireless are being considered as a Commercial Off-The-Shelf solution to cover the operational requirements of the future warfare. The capabilities of these technologies are being enhanced to meet the growing market demands on performance. In this context, several standards such as WiMAX, LTE or WLAN are introducing themselves as strong candidates to fulfill these requirements. This paper presents an innovative scenario-based approach to develop a Military Broadband Wireless Communication System (MBWCS). Its main objective is to analyze how similar a military MBWCS can be to the identified civil standards, taking operational and high level technical requirements into account. This specification will be used for analyzing the applicability and the modifications of each of the standards layers individually. Proving the feasibility and aptitude of each standard provides strong foundations to address a MBWCS in the most efficient way.</description>

      <title>Computation Offloading for Multi-server Multi-access Edge Vehicular Networks: A DDQN-based Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-user offloading problem in the overlapping domain of a multi-server mobile edge computing system. We divide the original problem into two stages: the offloading decision making stage and the request scheduling stage. To prevent the terminal from going out of service area during offloading, we consider the mobility parameter of the terminal according to the human behaviour model when making the offloading decision, and then introduce a server evaluation mechanism based on both the mobility parameter and the server load to select the optimal offloading server. In order to fully utilise the server resources, we design a double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based reward evaluation algorithm that considers the priority of tasks when scheduling offload requests. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify that our proposed method outperforms traditional mathematical computation methods as well as the DQN algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Behavioral Transparency of Protocols Communicated by IoT Networked Assets (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral transparency for Internet-of-Things (IoT) networked assets involves two distinct yet interconnected tasks: (a) characterizing device types by discerning the patterns exhibited in their network traffic, and (b) assessing vulnerabilities they introduce to the network. While identifying communication protocols, particularly at the application layer, plays a vital role in effective network management, current methods are, at best, ad-hoc. Accurate protocol identification and attribute extraction from packet payloads are crucial for distinguishing devices and discovering vulnerabilities. This paper makes three contributions: (1) We process a public dataset to construct specific packet traces pertinent to six standard protocols (TLS, HTTP, DNS, NTP, DHCP, and SSDP) of ten commercial IoT devices. We manually analyze TLS and HTTP flows, highlighting their characteristics, parameters, and adherence to best practices-we make our data publicly available; (2) We develop a common model to describe protocol signatures that help with the systematic analysis of protocols even when communicated through non-standard port numbers; and, (3) We evaluate the efficacy of our data models for the six protocols, which constitute approximately 97% of our dataset. Our data models, except for SSDP in 0.3% of Amazon Echo's flows, produce no false positives for protocol detection. We draw insights into how various IoT devices behave across those protocols by applying these models to our IoT traces.</description>

      <title>Two-Way Aerial Secure Communications via Distributed Collaborative Beamforming under Eavesdropper Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled aerial communication provides a flexible, reliable, and cost-effective solution for a range of wireless applications. However, due to the high line-of-sight (LoS) probability, aerial communications between UAVs are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, particularly when multiple eavesdroppers collude. In this work, we aim to introduce distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB) into UAV swarms and handle the eavesdropper collusion by controlling the corresponding signal distributions. Specifically, we consider a two-way DCB-enabled aerial communication between two UAV swarms and construct these swarms as two UAV virtual antenna arrays. Then, we minimize the two-way known secrecy capacity and the maximum sidelobe level to avoid information leakage from the known and unknown eavesdroppers, respectively. Simultaneously, we also minimize the energy consumption of UAVs for constructing virtual antenna arrays. Due to the conflicting relationships between secure performance and energy efficiency, we consider these objectives as a multi-objective optimization problem. Following this, we propose an enhanced multi-objective swarm intelligence algorithm via the characterized properties of the problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can obtain a set of informative solutions and outperform other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Experimental tests demonstrate that our method can be deployed in limited computing power platforms of UAVs and is beneficial for saving computational resources.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Ground-Space Communications via Evolutionary Multi-objective Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB)-based uplink communication paradigm for enabling ground-space direct communications. Specifically, DCB treats the terminals that are unable to establish efficient direct connections with the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as distributed antennas, forming a virtual antenna array to enhance the terminal-to-satellite uplink achievable rates and durations. However, such systems need multiple trade-off policies that variously balance the terminal-satellite uplink achievable rate, energy consumption of terminals, and satellite switching frequency to satisfy the scenario requirement changes. Thus, we perform a multi-objective optimization analysis and formulate a long-term optimization problem. To address availability in different terminal cluster scales, we reformulate this problem into an action space-reduced and universal multi-objective Markov decision process. Then, we propose an evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the desirable policies, in which the low-value actions are masked to speed up the training process. As such, the applicability of a one-time trained model can cover more changing terminal-satellite uplink scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outmatches various baselines, and draw some useful insights. Specifically, it is found that DCB enables terminals that cannot reach the uplink achievable threshold to achieve efficient direct uplink transmission, which thus reveals that DCB is an effective solution for enabling direct ground-space communications. Moreover, it reveals that the proposed algorithm achieves multiple policies favoring different objectives and achieving near-optimal uplink achievable rates with low switching frequency.</description>

      <title>UAV-enabled Collaborative Beamforming via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assistant air-to-ground communication system, where multiple UAVs form a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (UVAA) to communicate with remote base stations by utilizing collaborative beamforming. To improve the work efficiency of the UVAA, we formulate a UAV-enabled collaborative beamforming multi-objective optimization problem (UCBMOP) to simultaneously maximize the transmission rate of the UVAA and minimize the energy consumption of all UAVs by optimizing the positions and excitation current weights of all UAVs. This problem is challenging because these two optimization objectives conflict with each other, and they are non-concave to the optimization variables. Moreover, the system is dynamic, and the cooperation among UAVs is complex, making traditional methods take much time to compute the optimization solution for a single task. In addition, as the task changes, the previously obtained solution will become obsolete and invalid. To handle these issues, we leverage the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to address the UCBMOP. Specifically, we use the heterogeneous-agent trust region policy optimization (HATRPO) as the basic framework, and then propose an improved HATRPO algorithm, namely HATRPO-UCB, where three techniques are introduced to enhance the performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can learn a better strategy compared with other methods. Moreover, extensive experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) for enhanced monitoring and optimization of Water Distribution Systems (WDSs). The framework aims to investigate the utilization of massive IoT in monitoring and optimizing WDSs, with a particular focus on leakage detection, energy consumption and wireless network performance assessment in real-world water networks. The framework integrates simulation environments at both the application level (using EPANET) and the radio level (using NS-3) within the LoRaWAN network. The paper culminates with a practical use case, alongside evaluation results concerning power consumption in a large-scale LoRaWAN network and strategies for optimal gateway positioning.</description>

      <title>Correctness of Flow Migration Across Network Function Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Functions (NFs) improve the safety and efficiency of networks. Flows traversing NFs may need to be migrated to balance load, conserve energy, etc. When NFs are stateful, the information stored on the NF per flow must be migrated before the flows are migrated, to avoid problems of consistency. We examine what it means to correctly migrate flows from a stateful NF instance. We define the property of Weak-O, where only the state information required for packets to be correctly forwarded is migrated first, while the remaining states are eventually migrated. Weak-O can be preserved without buffering or dropping packets, unlike existing algorithms. We propose an algorithm that preserves Weak-O and prove its correctness. Even though this may cause packet re-ordering, we experimentally demonstrate that the goodputs with and without migration are comparable when the old and new paths have the same delays and bandwidths, or when the new path has larger bandwidth or at most 5 times longer delays, thus making this practical, contrary to what was thought before. We also prove that no criterion stronger than Weak-O can be preserved in a flow migration system that requires no buffering or dropping of packets and eventually synchronizes its states.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Vulnerable Road Users Occlusion Risk Via Collective Perception: An Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports from the World Health Organization highlight that Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) have been involved in over half of the road fatalities in recent years, with occlusion risk - a scenario where VRUs are hidden from drivers' view by obstacles like parked vehicles - being a critical contributing factor. To address this, we present a novel algorithm that quantifies occlusion risk based on the dynamics of both vehicles and VRUs. This algorithm has undergone testing and evaluation using a real-world dataset from German intersections. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Maximum Tracking Loss (MTL), which measures the longest consecutive duration a VRU remains untracked by any vehicle in a given scenario. Our study extends to examining the role of the Collective Perception Service (CPS) in VRU safety. CPS enhances safety by enabling vehicles to share sensor information, thereby potentially reducing occlusion risks. Our analysis reveals that a 25% market penetration of CPS-equipped vehicles can substantially diminish occlusion risks and significantly curtail MTL. These findings demonstrate how various scenarios pose different levels of risk to VRUs and how the deployment of Collective Perception can markedly improve their safety. Furthermore, they underline the efficacy of our proposed metrics to capture occlusion risk as a safety factor.</description>

      <title>An Application Layer Multi-Hop Collective Perception Service for Vehicular Adhoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective Perception will play a crucial role for ensuring vehicular safety in the near future, enabling the sharing of local perceived objects with other Intelligent Transport System Stations (ITS-Ss). However, at the beginning of the roll-out, low market penetration rates are expected. This paper proposes and evaluates an application layer multi-hop Collective Perception Service (CPS) for vehicular ad-hoc networks. The goal is to improve the environmental awareness ratio in scenarios with low CPS market penetration. In such scenarios, the CPS service without forwarding enabled struggles to achieve complete awareness. A decentralized application layer forwarding algorithm is presented that shares perceived object information across multiple hops while maintaining a low age of information. The proposed approach is compared against standard CPS with no forwarding and CPS with geographically-scoped (GBC) multi-hop forwarding. Simulations according to standards of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) demonstrate that the application layer forwarding achieves near 100% awareness at 10% penetration rate versus 92% for standard CPS. The awareness improvement comes with moderate channel load, unlike GBC forwarding which quickly saturates the channel. The median age of information remains below 80 ms for the proposed scheme, enabling real-time CPS operation. Our application layer multi-hop approach effectively improves environmental awareness during initial CPS deployment while aligning with latency and channel load requirements.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning of Tangled Key-Value Sequence Data for Early Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key-value sequence data has become ubiquitous and naturally appears in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from the user-product purchasing sequences in e-commerce, to network packet sequences forwarded by routers in networking. Classifying these key-value sequences is important in many scenarios such as user profiling and malicious applications identification. In many time-sensitive scenarios, besides the requirement of classifying a key-value sequence accurately, it is also desired to classify a key-value sequence early, in order to respond fast. However, these two goals are conflicting in nature, and it is challenging to achieve them simultaneously. In this work, we formulate a novel tangled key-value sequence early classification problem, where a tangled key-value sequence is a mixture of several concurrent key-value sequences with different keys. The goal is to classify each individual key-value sequence sharing a same key both accurately and early. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, i.e., Key-Value sequence Early Co-classification (KVEC), which leverages both inner- and inter-correlations of items in a tangled key-value sequence through key correlation and value correlation to learn a better sequence representation. Meanwhile, a time-aware halting policy decides when to stop the ongoing key-value sequence and classify it based on current sequence representation. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. KVEC improves the prediction accuracy by up to $4.7 - 17.5\%$ under the same prediction earliness condition, and improves the harmonic mean of accuracy and earliness by up to $3.7 - 14.0\%$.</description>

      <title>IQ Skew and Imbalance Estimation for Coherent Point-to-Multi-Point Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent point-to-multi-point (PtMP) optical network based on digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) has been a promising technology for metro and access networks to achieve cost savings, low latency, and high flexibility. In-phase and quadrature (IQ) impairments of the coherent transceiver (e.g. IQ skew and power imbalance) cause severe performance degradation. In the DSCM-based coherent PtMP optical networks, it is hard to realize far-end IQ-impairments estimation for the hub transmitter because the leaf on one subcarrier cannot acquire the signal on the symmetrical subcarrier. In this paper, we propose a far-end IQ-impairments estimation based on the specially designed time-and-frequency interleaving tones (TFITs), which can simultaneously estimate IQ skews and power imbalances of the hub transmitter and leaf receiver at an individual leaf. The feasibility of the TFITs-based IQ-impairments estimation has been experimentally verified by setting up $8$Gbaud/SC $\times$ $4$SCs DSCM-based coherent PtMP optical network. The experimental results depict that the absolute errors in the estimated IQ skew and power imbalance are within $\pm 0.5$ps and $\pm 0.2$dB, respectively. In conclusion, TFITs-based IQ-impairments estimation has great potential for DSCM-based coherent PtMP optical networks.</description>
