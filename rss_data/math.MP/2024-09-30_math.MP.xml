      <title>Eigenvalue distribution of large weighted multipartite random sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of eigenvalues of weighted adjacency matrices from a specific ensemble of random graphs. We distribute $N$ vertices across a fixed number $\kappa$ of components, with asymptotically $\alpha_j \dot N$ vertices in each component, where the vector $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{\kappa})$ is fixed. Consider a connected graph $\Gamma$ with $\kappa$ vertices. We construct a multipartite graph with $N$ vertices, in which all vertices in the $i$-th component are connected to all vertices in the $j$-th component if if $\Gamma_{ij}=1$. Conversely, if $\Gamma_{ij}=0$, no edge connects the $i$-th and $j$-th components. In the resulting graph, we independently retain each edge with a probability of $p/N$, where $p$ is a fixed parameter. To each remaining edge, we assign an independent weight with a fixed distribution, that possesses all finite moments. We establish the weak convergence in probability of a random counting measure to a non-random probability measure. Furthermore, the moments of the limiting measure can be derived from a system of recurrence relations.</description>

      <title>From Clifford Bundles to Spinor Classification: Algebraic and Geometric Approaches, and New Spinor Classes in Flux Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By bridging geometric and algebraic concepts, this dissertation lays the groundwork for a comprehensive study of the Clifford structures on bundles and spinor fields. We delve into the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle, which encapsulates the essence of Clifford algebras and provides profound insights into the algebraic structures underlying geometric frameworks. The algebraic and classical definitions of spinors within Clifford algebras are concerned, as well as their global realisation as sections of the bundle of spinors constructed within a spin structure on a manifold from the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle background which serves as an effective framework for applications involving spinors such as their classification based on their bilinear covariants and Fierz identities. Homogeneous differential forms playing the role of bilinear covariants can vanish due to algebraic obstructions in a warped flux compactification AdS$_3 \times M_8$ yielding the identification of new spinor field classes.</description>

      <title>Lie-Hamilton systems associated with the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(6, \mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New classes of Lie-Hamilton systems are obtained from the six-dimensional fundamental representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(6,\mathbb{R})$. The ansatz is based on a recently proposed procedure for constructing higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems through the representation theory of Lie algebras. As applications of the procedure, we study a time-dependent electromagnetic field and several types of coupled oscillators. The irreducible embedding of the special unitary Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ into $\mathfrak{sp}(6, \mathbb{R})$ is also considered, yielding Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the sum of the quark and antiquark three-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, which are applied in the construction of t-dependent coupled systems. In addition, t-independent constants of the motion are obtained explicitly for all these Lie-Hamilton systems, which allows the derivation of a nonlinear superposition rule</description>

      <title>Canonical transformations: from the coordinate based approach to the geometric one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the theory of time-dependent and time-independent canonical transformations is considered from a geometric perspective. Both the geometric formalism and the coordinate based approach are described in detail. In particular, one-parameter groups of canonical transformations are geometrically identified with flows of Hamiltonian vector fields which, in turn, are their infinitesimal generators. Likewise, infinitesimal generators of invariance transformations are geometrically characterized. The main results are established in the form of theorems and the connection between the geometric and the coordinate based frameworks is remarked using concrete examples.</description>

      <title>The Dirac operator for the pair of Ruelle and Koopman operators, and a generalized Boson formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denote by $\mu$ the maximal entropy measure for the shift acting on $\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, by $\mathcal{L}$ the associated Ruelle operator and by $\mathcal{K} = \mathcal{L}^*$ the Koopman operator, both acting on $L^2(\mu)$. It is natural to call $\mathfrak{a} = \mathcal{L}$ the annihilation operator, and $\mathfrak{a}^\dag = \mathfrak{c} = \mathcal{K}$ the creation operator (see (*)). We call $\mathcal{K} \mathcal{L} = \mathfrak{c} \mathfrak{a}$ the generalized (dynamical) boson Number operator. In our mathematical framework we consider the following complete orthogonal family of functions in $L^2(\mu)$: given a finite word $w = w_1 w_2 \cdots w_l$, $w_j \in \{0,1\}$, denote $e_w \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu([w])}} \left( \mathfrak{1}_{[w1]} - \mathfrak{1}_{[w0]} \right)$, and add $e_{\emptyset}^1 = \sqrt{2}\,\mathfrak{1}_{[1]}, e_{\emptyset}^0 = - \sqrt{2}\,\mathfrak{1}_{[0]}$ to the family. Claim: $\mathfrak{c}(e_w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( e_{0w} + e_{1w} )$ and $\mathfrak{a} (e_{w_1 w_2 \cdots w_n}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} e_{w_2 w_3 \cdots w_n}$ (*), justifying the above terminology. Here the Dirac operator is:
  $$\mathcal{D}= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
  0 &amp; \mathcal{K}
  \mathcal{L} &amp; 0
  \end{array} \right)$$
  Introducing a natural diagonal representation $\pi$ on the set of bounded operators $L$ acting on $L^2(\mu)$, we set a certain natural spectral triple, and we estimate $\|\,\left[\mathcal{D}, \pi(L)\right]\,\|$ in several cases; $\|\,\left[\mathcal{D}, \pi(L)\right]\,\|\leq 1$ corresponds to saying that the Lipchitz constant of $L$ is $\leq1$. We show that $\|\, \left[\mathcal{D} ,\pi(\mathcal{K} \mathcal{L})\right] \,\| = 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the existence of globally conservative weak solutions for a class of two-component nonlinear dispersive wave equations beyond wave breaking. We first introduce a new set of independent and dependent variables in connection with smooth solutions, and transform the system into an equivalent semi-linear system. We then establish the global existence of solutions for the semi-linear system via the standard theory of ordinary differential equations. Finally, by the inverse transformation method, we prove the existence of the globally conservative weak solution for the original system.</description>

      <title>Generic and Scalable Differential Equation Solver for Quantum Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important topics in quantum scientific computing is solving differential equations. In this paper, generalized quantum functional expansion (QFE) framework is proposed. In the QFE framework, a functional expansion of solution is encoded into a quantum state and the time evolution of the quantum state is solved with variational quantum simulation (VQS). The quantum functional encoding supports different numerical schemes of functional expansions. The lower bound of the required number of qubits is double logarithm of the inverse error bound in the QFE framework. Furthermore, a new parallel Pauli operation strategy is proposed to significantly improve the scalability of VQS. The number of circuits in VQS is exponentially reduced to only the quadratic order of the number of ansatz parameters. Four example differential equations are solved to demonstrate the generic QFE framework.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly solve a recurrence relation due to Feigin and Fuchs to obtain the Casimirs of the Virasoro algebra in terms of the inverse of the Shapovalov form. Combined with our recent result for the inverse Shapovalov form, this allows us to write the Casimir operators as linear combinations of products of singular vectors.</description>

      <title>On Inverse Problems for Two-Dimensional Steady Supersonic Euler Flows past Curved Wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the well-posedness of an inverse problem for determining the wedge boundary and associated two-dimensional steady supersonic Euler flow past the wedge, provided that the pressure distribution on the boundary surface of the wedge and the incoming state of the flow are given. We first establish the existence of wedge boundaries and associated entropy solutions of the inverse problem when the pressure on the wedge boundary is larger than that of the incoming flow but less than a critical value, and the total variation of the incoming flow and the pressure distribution is sufficiently small. This is achieved by carefully constructing suitable approximate solutions and approximate boundaries via developing a wave-front tracking algorithm and the rigorous proof of their strong convergence to a global entropy solution and a wedge boundary respectively. Then we establish the $L^{\infty}$--stability of the wedge boundaries, by introducing a modified Lyapunov functional for two different solutions with two distinct boundaries, each of which may contain a strong shock-front. The modified Lyapunov functional is carefully designed to control the distance between the two boundaries and is proved to be Lipschitz continuous with respect to the differences of the incoming flow and the pressure on the wedge, which leads to the existence of the Lipschitz semigroup. Finally, when the pressure distribution on the wedge boundary is sufficiently close to that of the incoming flow, using this semigroup, we compare two solutions of the inverse problem in the respective supersonic full Euler flow and potential flow and prove that, at $x&gt;0$, the distance between the two boundaries and the difference of the two solutions are of the same order of $x$ multiplied by the cube of the perturbations of the initial boundary data in $L^\infty\cap BV$.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping string models with entanglement minimization and Machine-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to bootstrapping string-like theories by exploiting a local crossing symmetric dispersion relation and field redefinition ambiguities. This approach enables us to use mass-level truncation and to go beyond the dual resonance hypothesis. We consider both open and closed strings, focusing mainly on open tree-level amplitudes with integer-spaced spectrum, and two leading Wilson coefficients as inputs. Using entanglement minimization in the form of the minimum of the first finite moment of linear entropy or entangling power, we get an excellent approximation to the superstring amplitudes, including the leading and sub-leading Regge trajectories. We find other interesting S-matrices which do not obey the duality hypothesis, but exhibit a transition from Regge behaviour to power law behaviour in the high energy limit. Finally, we also examine Machine-Learning techniques to do bootstrap and discuss potential advantages over the present approach.</description>

      <title>The QES sextic and Morse potentials: exact WKB condition and supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of [Contreras-Astorga A., Escobar-Ruiz A. M. and Linares R., \textit{Phys. Scr.} {\bf99} 025223 (2024)] the one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable (QES) sextic potential $V^{\rm(qes)}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(\nu\, x^{6} + 2\, \nu\, \mu\,x^{4} + \left[\mu^2-(4N+3)\nu \right]\, x^{2})$ is considered. In the cases $N=0,\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{2},\,\frac{7}{10}$ the WKB correction $\gamma=\gamma(N,n)$ is calculated for the first lowest 50 states $n\in [0,\,50]$ using highly accurate data obtained by the Lagrange Mesh Method. Closed analytical approximations for both $\gamma$ and the energy $E=E(N,n)$ of the system are constructed. They provide a reasonably relative accuracy $|\Delta|$ with upper bound $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for all the values of $(N,n)$ studied. Also, it is shown that the QES Morse potential is shape invariant characterized by a hidden $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$ Lie algebra and vanishing WKB correction $\gamma=0$.</description>

      <title>A direct approach for solving the cubic Szeg\"o equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cubic Szeg\"o equation which is an integrable nonlinear non-dispersive and nonlocal evolution equation. In particular, we present a direct approach for obtaining the multiphase and multisoliton solutions as well as a special class of periodic solutions. Our method is substantially different from the existing one which relies mainly on the spectral analysis of the Hankel operator. We show that the cubic Szeg\"o equation can be bilinearized through appropriate dependent variable transformations and then the solutions satisfy a set of bilinear equations. The proof is carried out within the framework of an elementary theory of determinants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the eigenfunctions associated with the multiphase solutions satisfy the Lax pair for the cubic Szeg\"o equation, providing an alternative proof of the solutions. Last, the eigenvalue problem for a periodic solution is solved exactly to obtain the analytical expressions of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banks--Panzer--Pym have shown that the volume integrals appearing in Kontsevich's deformation quantization formula always evaluate to integer-linear combinations of multiple zeta values (MZVs). We prove a sort of converse, which they conjectured in their work, namely that with the logarithmic propagator: (1) the coefficients associated to the graphs appearing at order $\hbar^n$ in the quantization formula generate the Q-vector space of weight-$n$ MZVs, and (2) the set of all coefficients generates the Z-module of MZVs. In order to prove this result, we develop a new technique for integrating Kontsevich graphs using polylogarithms and apply it to an infinite subset of Kontsevich graphs. Then, using the binary string representation of MZVs and the Lyndon word decomposition of binary strings, we show that this subset of graphs generates all MZVs.</description>

      <title>Bath Dynamical Decoupling with a Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bang-bang dynamical decoupling protects an open quantum system from decoherence due to its interaction with the surrounding bath/environment. In its standard form, this is achieved by strongly kicking the system with cycles of unitary operations, which average out the interaction Hamiltonian. In this paper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with a quantum channel. This procedure is physically motivated by applying these CPTP kicks to the bath. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath dynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we study in which circumstances CPTP kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce quantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require the ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is both necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling is essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies that this is not true any more in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our results, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that might be of independent interest. Our approach establishes an enhanced and unified mathematical understanding of several recent experimental demonstrations and might form the basis of new dynamical decoupling schemes that harness environmental noise degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Deformation maps in proto-twilled Leibniz algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to find a unified approach to studying the cohomology theories of various operators on Leibniz algebras. We first introduce deformation maps in a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra to do this. Such maps generalize various well-known operators (such as homomorphisms, derivations, crossed homomorphisms, Rota-Baxter operators, modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators etc) defined on Leibniz algebras and embedding tensors on Lie algebras. We define the cohomology of a deformation map unifying the existing cohomologies of all the operators mentioned above. Then we construct a curved $L_\infty$-algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are precisely deformation maps in a given proto-twilled Leibniz algebra. In particular, we get the Maurer-Cartan characterizations of modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds operators on a Leibniz algebra. Finally, given a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and a deformation map $r$, we construct two governing $L_\infty$-algebras, the first one controls the deformations of the operator $r$ while the second one controls the simultaneous deformations of both the proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and the operator $r$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity in the Lorentzian Calder\'on problem with formally determined data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Lorentzian Calder\'on problem, where the objective is to determine a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian metric up to a boundary fixing diffeomorphism from boundary measurements given by the hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This problem is a wave equation analogue of the Calder\'on problem on Riemannian manifolds. We prove that if a globally hyperbolic metric agrees with the Minkowski metric outside a compact set and has the same hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as the Minkowski metric, then it must be the Minkowski metric up to diffeomorphism. In fact we prove the same result with a much smaller amount of measurements, thus solving a formally determined inverse problem. To prove these results we introduce a new method for geometric hyperbolic inverse problems. The method is based on distorted plane wave solutions and on a combination of geometric, topological and unique continuation arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that specific exponential bivariate integrals serve as generating functions of labeled edge-bicolored graphs. Based on this, we prove an asymptotic formula for the number of regular edge-bicolored graphs with arbitrary weights assigned to different vertex structures. The asymptotic behavior is governed by the critical points of a polynomial. As an application, we discuss the Ising model on a random 4-regular graph and show how its phase transitions arise from our formula.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the trajectories of unreduced $\phi$-simple Chaplygin kinetic systems are reparametrizations of horizontal geodesics with respect to a modified Riemannian metric. Furthermore, our proof is constructive and these Riemannian metrics, which are not unique, are obtained explicitly in interesting examples. We also extend these results to $\phi$-simple Chaplygin mechanical systems (not necessarily kinetic).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories are Markov processes describing the evolution of a quantum system subject to indirect measurements. They can be viewed as place dependent iterated function systems or the result of products of dependent and non identically distributed random matrices. In this article, we establish a complete classification of their invariant measures. The classification is done in two steps. First, we prove a Markov process on some linear subspaces called dark subspaces, defined in (Maassen, K\"ummerer 2006), admits a unique invariant measure. Second, we study the process inside the dark subspaces. Using a notion of minimal family of isometries from a reference space to dark subspaces, we prove a set of measures indexed by orbits of a unitary group is the set of ergodic measures of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown deriving the pseudometrics from unitary transformations is sufficient to recover a value of zero if two systems are topologically conjugate. Therefore the pseudometrics for quantifying deviation from conjugacy are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Finally, geometric considerations for the Pareto optimality problem associated with deviation from conjugacy are used to develop pseudometrics that account for all possible solutions given just two Pareto points based on analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string: the worldsheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-dimensional string theory defined by coupling two copies of Liouville CFT with complex central charge $c=13\pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. This string theory defines a novel, consistent and controllable model of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We use the exact solution of the worldsheet theory to derive stringent constraints on the analytic structure of the string amplitudes as a function of the vertex operator momenta. Together with other worldsheet constraints, this allows us to completely pin down the string amplitudes without explicitly computing the moduli space integrals. We focus on the case of the sphere four-point amplitude and torus one-point amplitude as worked examples. This is the first in a series of papers on the complex Liouville string: three subsequent papers will elucidate the holographic duality with a two-matrix integral, discuss worldsheet boundaries and non-perturbative effects, and connect the theory to de Sitter quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Consistent Canonical Quantization of Gravity: Recovery of Classical GR from BRST-invariant Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of General Relativity, as an effective quantum field theory below the Planck scale, within the BRST-invariant framework. We show that the promotion of constraints to dynamical equations of motion for auxiliary fields leads to the healthy Hamiltonian flow. In particular, we show that the classical properties of Einstein's gravity, such as vanishing Hamiltonian modulo boundary contribution, is realized merely as an expectation value in appropriate physical states. Most importantly, the physicality is shown not to entail trivial time-evolution for correlation functions. In the present approach we quantize the theory once and for all around the Minkowaski vacuum and treat other would-be classical backgrounds as BRST-invariant coherent states. This is especially important for cosmological spacetimes as it uncovers features that are not visible in ordinary semi-classical treatment. The Poincar\'e invariance of the vacuum, essential for our quantization, provides strong motivation for spontaneously-broken supersymmetry.</description>

Abstract: We prove the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility of weak null singularities without any symmetry assumptions. The proof introduces a new strategy to infer $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility from the blow-up of curvature. The assumed blow-up is expected to be satisfied for weak null singularities in the interior of generic rotating black holes. Thus, we expect the result presented here to directly contribute to the resolution of the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in a neighbourhood of subextremal Kerr.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nambu-determinant brackets on $R^d\ni x=(x^1,...,x^d)$, $\{f,g\}_d(x)=\rho(x) \det(\partial(f,g,a_1,...,a_{d-2})/\partial(x^1,...,x^d))$, with $a_i\in C^\infty(R^d)$ and $\rho\partial_x\in\mathfrak{X}^d(R^d)$, are a class of Poisson structures with (non)linear coefficients, e.g., polynomials of arbitrarily high degree. With good cocycles in the graph complex, Kontsevich associated universal -- for all Poisson bivectors $P$ on affine $R^d_{aff}$ -- elements $\dot{P}=Q^\gamma(P)\in H^2_{P}(R^d_{aff})$ in the Lichnerowicz-Poisson second cohomology groups; we note that known graph cocycles $\gamma$ preserve the Nambu-Poisson class $\{P(\rho,a)\}$, and we express, directly from $\gamma$, the evolution $\dot{\rho}$,$\dot{a}$ that induces $\dot{P}$.
  Over all $d\geq2$ at once, there is no universal mechanism for the bivector cocycles $Q^\gamma_d$ to be trivial, $Q^\gamma_d=[\![P,\vec{X}^\gamma_d(P)]\!]$, w.r.t. vector fields defined uniformly for all dimensions $d$ by the same graph formula. While over $R^2$, the graph flows $\dot{P} = Q^{\gamma_i}_{2D}(P(\rho))$ for $\gamma\in\{\gamma_3,\gamma_5,\gamma_7,...\}$ are trivialized by vector fields $\vec{X}^{\gamma_i}_{2D}=(dx\wedge dy)^{-1}d_{dR}(Ham^{\gamma_i}(P))$ of peculiar shape, we detect that in $d\geq3$, the 1-vectors from 2D, now with $P(\rho,a_1,...,a_{d-2})$ inside, do not solve the problems $Q^{\gamma_i}_{d\geq3}=[\![P,{\vec{X}^{\gamma_i}_{d\geq3}}(P(\rho,a))]\!]$, yet they do yield good Ansatz where we find solutions $\vec{X}^{\gamma_i}_{d=3,4}(P(\rho,a))$. In the study of the step $d\mapsto d+1$, by adapting the Kontsevich graph calculus to the Nambu-Poisson class of brackets, we discover more identities for the Jacobian determinants within $P(\rho,a)$, i.e. for multivector-valued $GL(d)$-invariants on $R^d_{aff}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fluctuation-dissipation theorem in open quantum systems from an information-theoretic perspective. We define the fidelity susceptibility that measures the sensitivity of the systems under perturbation and relate it to the fidelity correlator that characterizes the correlation behaviors for mixed quantum states. In particular, we determine the scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility in the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SW-SSB) phase, strongly symmetric short-range correlated phase, and the quantum critical point between them. We then provide a geometric perspective of our construction using distance measures of density matrices. We find that the metric of the quantum information geometry generated by perturbative distance between density matrices before and after perturbation is generally non-analytic. Finally, we design a polynomial proxy that can in principle be used as an experimental probe for detecting the SW-SSB and phase transition through quantum metrology. In particular, we show that each term of the polynomial proxy is related to the R\'enyi versions of the fidelity correlators.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical systems and physical models defined on idealized continuous phase spaces are known to exhibit non-computable phenomena, examples include the wave equation, recurrent neural networks, or Julia sets in holomorphic dynamics. Inspired by the works of Moore and Siegelmann, we show that ideal fluids, modeled by the Euler equations, are capable of simulating poly-time Turing machines with polynomial advice on compact three-dimensional domains. This is precisely the complexity class $P/poly$ considered by Siegelmann in her study of analog recurrent neural networks. In addition, we introduce a new class of symbolic systems, related to countably piecewise linear transformations of the unit square, that is capable of simulating Turing machines with advice in real-time, contrary to previously known models.</description>

      <title>Trace formulas revisited and a new representation of KdV solutions with short-range initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a new approach to Deift-Trubowitz type trace formulas for the 1D Schrodinger operator with potentials that are summable with the first moment (short-range potentials). We prove that these formulas are preserved under the KdV flow whereas the class of short-range potentials is not. Finally, we show that our formulas are well-suited to study the dispersive smoothing effect.</description>

      <title>The Laplace Transform and Quantum Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Laplace transform that maps the topological recursion (TR) wavefunction to its $x$-$y$ swap dual is defined. This transform is then applied to the construction of quantum curves. General results are obtained, including a formula for the quantisation of many spectral curves of the form $e^xP_2(e^y) - P_1(e^y) = 0$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are coprime polynomials; an important class that contains interesting spectral curves related to mirror symmetry and knot theory that have, heretofore, evaded the general TR-based methods previously used to derive quantum curves. Quantum curves known in the literature are reproduced, and new quantum curves are derived. In particular, the quantum curve for the $T$-equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{P}(a,b)$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>Tree-tubings and the combinatorics of resurgent Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the $\Phi^4_3$ measures on closed Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constructed in a previous work the $\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact boundaryless $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds as some invariant probability measures of some Markovian dynamics. We prove in the present work that these dynamics have unique invariant probability measures. This is done by using an explicit coupling by change of measure that does not require any a priori information on the support of the law of the solution to the dynamics. In addition, the coupling can be used to see that the semigroup generated by the dynamics satisfies a Harnack-type inequality, which entails that the semigroup has the strong Feller property.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>

Abstract: We consider N x N matrices with complex entries that are perturbed by a complex Gaussian matrix with small variance. We prove that if the unperturbed matrix satisfies certain local laws then the bulk correlation functions are universal in the large N limit. Assuming the entries are independent and identically distributed with a common distribution that has finite moments, the Gaussian component is removed by the four moment theorem of Tao and Vu.</description>

      <title>Projective toric designs, quantum state designs, and mutually unbiased bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toric $t$-designs, or equivalently $t$-designs on the diagonal subgroup of the unitary group, are sets of points on the torus over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full torus. Motivated by the projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs on the projective torus, which have a much more restricted structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various new constructions of toric and projective toric designs and prove bounds on their size. We draw connections between projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric, informationally complete positive operator valued measures and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) from quantum information theory, and crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs. In particular, we construct families of (uniformly-weighted) quantum state $2$-designs in dimension $d$ of size exactly $d(d+1)$ that do not form complete sets of MUBs, thereby disproving a conjecture concerning the relationship between designs and MUBs (Zhu 2015). We then propose a modification of Zhu's conjecture and discuss potential paths towards proving this conjecture. We prove a fundamental distinction between complete sets of MUBs in prime-power dimensions versus in dimension $6$ (and, we conjecture, in all non-prime-power dimensions), the distinction relating to group structure of the corresponding projective toric design. Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number theory, geometry, and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We consider real, Gauss-divisible matrices $A_{t}=A+\sqrt{t}B$, where $B$ is from the real Ginibre ensemble. We prove that the bulk correlation functions converge to a universal limit for $t=O(N^{-1/3+\epsilon})$ if $A$ satisfies certain local laws. If $A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}(\xi_{jk})_{j,k=1}^{N}$ with $\xi_{jk}$ independent and identically distributed real random variables having zero mean, unit variance and finite moments, the Gaussian component can be removed using local laws proven by Bourgade--Yau--Yin, Alt--Erd\H{o}s--Kr\"{u}ger and Cipolloni--Erd\H{o}s--Schr\"{o}der and the four moment theorem of Tao--Vu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore alternative formulations of the analogy between viable Horndeski gravity and Eckart's first-order thermodynamics. We single out a class of identifications for the effective stress-energy tensor of the scalar field fluid that, upon performing the imperfect fluid decomposition, yields constitutive relations that can be mapped onto Eckart's theory. We then investigate how different couplings to Einstein's gravity, at the level of the field equations, can affect the thermodynamic formalism overall. Last, we specialize the discussion to the case of ``traditional'' scalar-tensor theories and identify a specific choice of the coupling function that leads to a significant simplification of the formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the class of $1+1$ dimensional field theories referred to as the non-linear sigma models, there is known to be a deep connection between classical integrability and one-loop renormalizability. In this work, the phenomenon is reviewed on the example of the so-called fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ Principal Chiral Field (PCF). Along the way, we discover a new classically integrable four parameter family of sigma models, which is obtained from the fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ PCF by means of the Poisson-Lie deformation. The theory turns out to be one-loop renormalizable and the system of ODEs describing the flow of the four couplings is derived. Also provided are explicit analytical expressions for the full set of functionally independent first integrals (renormalization group invariants).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pursue the current developments in random tensor theory by laying the foundations of a free probability theory for tensors and establish its relevance in the study of random tensors of high dimension. We give a definition of freeness associated to a collection of tensors of possibly different orders. Our definition reduces to the usual freeness when only tensors of order 2 are concerned. We define the free cumulants which are associated to this notion of tensor freeness. We prove that the basic models of random tensors are asymptotically free as the dimension goes to infinity. On the way, we establish Schwinger-Dyson loop equations associated to random tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A closed-form relaxation model for homogeneous plasmas could be presented in terms of Gauss hypergeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model and the zeroth-order Braginskii heat transfer model can also be derived. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model based on the hypothesis that the plasmas system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, without relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Dirac particles interacting with external fields, we use the exact operator of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation obtained by Eriksen and rigorously derive a leading correction in the weak-field approximation to the known relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we carry out the operator extraction of a square root in the Eriksen operator. The derived correction is important for the scattering of relativistic particles. Since the description of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second order is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativistic wave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the relativistic wave equation of the second order is obtained with the correction similar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian approach to origami vertex analysis: Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of origami in engineering has significantly expanded in recent years, spanning deployable structures across scales, folding robotics, and mechanical metamaterials. However, finding foldable paths can be a formidable task as the kinematics are determined by a nonlinear system of equations, often with several degrees of freedom. In this work, we leverage a Lagrangian approach to derive reduced-order compatibility conditions for rigid-facet origami vertices with reflection and rotational symmetries. Then, using the reduced-order conditions, we derive exact, multi-degree of freedom solutions for degree 6 and degree 8 vertices with prescribed symmetries. The exact kinematic solutions allow us to efficiently investigate the topology of allowable kinematics, including the consideration of a self-contact constraint, and then visually interpret the role of geometric design parameters on these admissible fold paths by monitoring the change in the kinematic topology. We then introduce a procedure to construct lower symmetry kinematic solutions by breaking symmetry of higher order kinematic solutions in a systematic way that preserves compatibility. The multi-degree of freedom solutions discovered here should assist with building intuition of the kinematic feasibility of higher degree origami vertices and also facilitate the development of new algorithmic procedures for origami-engineering design.</description>

Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We classify the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>
