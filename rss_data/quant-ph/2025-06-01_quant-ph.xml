      <description>arXiv:2505.23860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper discusses and explores the various points of intersection between quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). It describes how quantum computing could support the development of innovative AI solutions. It also examines use cases of classical AI that can empower research and development in quantum technologies, with a focus on quantum computing and quantum sensing. The purpose of this white paper is to provide a long-term research agenda aimed at addressing foundational questions about how AI and quantum computing interact and benefit one another. It concludes with a set of recommendations and challenges, including how to orchestrate the proposed theoretical work, align quantum AI developments with quantum hardware roadmaps, estimate both classical and quantum resources - especially with the goal of mitigating and optimizing energy consumption - advance this emerging hybrid software engineering discipline, and enhance European industrial competitiveness while considering societal implications.</description>

      <title>A complexity theory for non-local quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces a local interaction between two systems with a single round of communication and shared entanglement. Despite many partial results, it is known that a characterization of entanglement cost in at least certain NLQC tasks would imply significant breakthroughs in complexity theory. Here, we avoid these obstructions and take an indirect approach to understanding resource requirements in NLQC, which mimics the approach used by complexity theorists: we study the relative hardness of different NLQC tasks by identifying resource efficient reductions between them. Most significantly, we prove that $f$-measure and $f$-route, the two best studied NLQC tasks, are in fact equivalent under $O(1)$ overhead reductions. This result simplifies many existing proofs in the literature and extends several new properties to $f$-measure. For instance, we obtain sub-exponential upper bounds on $f$-measure for all functions, and efficient protocols for functions in the complexity class $\mathsf{Mod}_k\mathsf{L}$. Beyond this, we study a number of other examples of NLQC tasks and their relationships.</description>

      <title>How to Verify that a Small Device is Quantum, Unconditionally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proof of quantumness (PoQ) allows a classical verifier to efficiently test if a quantum machine is performing a computation that is infeasible for any classical machine. In this work, we propose a new approach for constructing PoQ protocols where soundness holds unconditionally assuming a bound on the memory of the prover, but otherwise no restrictions on its runtime. In this model, we propose two protocols:
  1. A simple protocol with a quadratic gap between the memory required by the honest parties and the memory bound of the adversary. The soundness of this protocol relies on Raz's (classical) memory lower bound for matrix inversion (Raz, FOCS 2016).
  2. A protocol that achieves an exponential gap, building on techniques from the literature on the bounded storage model (Dodis et al., Eurocrypt 2023).
  Both protocols are also efficiently verifiable. Despite having worse asymptotics, our first protocol is conceptually simple and relies only on arithmetic modulo 2, which can be implemented with one-qubit Hadamard and CNOT gates, plus a single one-qubit non-Clifford gate.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Polarization Entanglement Source: Photon Counting and Correlation Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial sources of polarization entanglement at telecommunication wavelengths are already available on the market, but they lack proper certification or third-party testing. We aim to provide a comprehensive testing framework for photon counting and correlation measurements to characterize the parameters of these sources in a scalable and repeatable manner. The detection setup is included in our considerations, as the non-idealities of the components negatively affect the relevance of the measurement results. We discuss bounds for both true and false coincidences with rigorous probabilistic approach, as their ratio directly impacts the resolution of coincidence measurements and is reflected in Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) in the quantum telecommunication system. Quantum State Tomography (QST), polarization visibility measurements, temporal correlations measurements, and computations of other statistics are to be performed and compared at the state-of-the-art level for a three commercially available sources. Given that QST is demanding in terms of number of measurements and post-processing analysis, we discuss the relevance of determining the degree of polarization entanglement considering solely other statistics of direct measurement approach.</description>

      <title>On the Physical Untenability of the Standard Notion of Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of quantum state plays a fundamental role within the Standard account of Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as established by Dirac and von Neumann during 1930s and up to the present. In this work we expose the deep inconsistencies that exist within the multiple definitions of the notion of quantum state that are provided within this axiomatic formulation. As we will argue, these different inconsistent definitions continue to be -- even today -- uncritically confused within the mainstream physical and philosophical literature leading to self-contradictory statements and wrong conclusions. We end with a discussion regarding the untenability of this concept for any rational understanding of theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Simplicial methods in the resource theory of contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a resource theory of contextuality within the framework of symmetric monoidal categories, extending recent simplicial approaches to quantum contextuality. Building on the theory of simplicial distributions, which integrates homotopy-theoretic structures with probability, we introduce event scenarios as a functorial generalization of presheaf-theoretic measurement scenarios and prove their equivalence to bundle scenarios via the Grothendieck construction. We define symmetric monoidal structures on these categories and extend the distribution functor to a stochastic setting, yielding a resource theory that generalizes the presheaf-theoretic notion of simulations. Our main result characterizes convex maps between simplicial distributions in terms of non-contextual distributions on a corresponding mapping scenario, enhancing and extending prior results in categorical quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging machine learning features for linear optical interferometer control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an algorithm that constructs a model of a reconfigurable optical interferometer, independent of specific architectural constraints. The programming of unitary transformations on the interferometer's optical modes relies on either an analytical method for deriving the unitary matrix from a set of phase shifts or an optimization routine when such decomposition is not available. Our algorithm employs a supervised learning approach, aligning the interferometer model with a training set derived from the device being studied. A straightforward optimization procedure leverages this trained model to determine the phase shifts of the interferometer with a specific architecture, obtaining the required unitary transformation. This approach enables the effective tuning of interferometers without requiring a precise analytical solution, paving the way for the exploration of new interferometric circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Correlated emission of electron-current waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated emission of light offer a potential avenue for entanglement generation between atomic spins, with potential application for sensing and quantum memory. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the correlated emission by color centers into an electronic bath of conduction electrons. Unlike emission into bosonic modes, electrons can absorb energy via two-particle processes across a large range of length scales. We find that two length scales are particularly relevant: one set by the Fermi velocity and the frequency of the color centers $v_F/\Delta$, and the other set by the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F \ll v_F/\Delta$. Subradiance requires emitters to be spaced at a distance closer than the Fermi wavelength, while superradiance requires spacing less than $\sqrt{\lambda_F v_F/\Delta}$, so long as the emitters are initialized with coherence. We show that the emitted current burst has a spiral form, and we discuss the experimental possibility to observe correlated dissipation by color-center qubits coupled to electronic environments.</description>

      <title>Automated Polarization Basis Adjustment and Security Monitoring in Quantum Communication via Coincidence Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive receivers for single photons are of crucial importance in various applications within the fields of quantum communication and quantum sensing, and are more commonly implemented in free-space optics rather than in optical fibers. This is primarily due to the unpredictable and varying birefringence in single-mode optical fibers. We present a method for birefringence compensation in an all-fiber detection setup that relies solely on coincidence measurements of a polarization-entangled state, or known correlations in a prepare-and-measure scenario. We define coincidence entropies as functions of the measured coincidence counts. These quantify the randomness of measurement outcomes, remain independent of the transmitted Bell state, and serve as indicators of the degree of entanglement. By leveraging coincidence entropy as a cost function in a gradient descent algorithm, we are able to align the polarization bases between two distinct polarization-sensitive receivers. Additionally, coincidence entropies can be employed to monitor the quality of entanglement transmission, thereby enhancing the system's ability to detect potential eavesdropping attempts, such as intercept-resend quantum attacks.</description>

      <title>Purcell Enhancement and Suppression in Laser Cooling of Yb$^{3+}$:YLF Nanocrystals in a Fabry-P\'erot Microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the improvement of anti-Stokes laser cooling of a Yb$^{3+}$:YLF nanocrystal in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity via the Purcell effect. Our analysis accounts for both the enhancement of emission lines resonant with the cavity transmission and the suppression of off-resonance emissions. Using a quantum-mechanical framework, we modeled the Yb$^{3+}$ ions in a YLiF$_4$ matrix and the laser system to calculate the minimum achievable temperature and cooling efficiency, incorporating cavity-induced modifications to experimental data on emission cross section. Our results indicate that for temperatures below 100~K, the cooling efficiency ($\eta_c$) is consistently enhanced, and the minimum achievable temperature is reduced comfortably below the current limits. We also show how the inclusion of Purcell inhibition effects can lead to improvements in the cooling efficiency ranging from 25\% to 65\%, with respect to the case when only Purcell enhancement is considered.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance Multilevel Framework for Quantum Layout Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) is a critical compilation stage that adapts quantum circuits to hardware constraints with an objective of minimizing the SWAP overhead. While heuristic tools demonstrate good efficiency, they often produce suboptimal solutions, and exact methods suffer from limited scalability. In this work, we propose ML-SABRE, a high-performance multilevel framework for QLS that improves both solution quality and compilation time through a hierarchical optimization approach. We employ the state-of-the-art heuristic method, LightSABRE, at all levels to ensure both efficiency and performance. Our evaluation on real benchmarks and hardware architectures shows that ML-SABRE decreases SWAP count by over 60%, circuit depth by 17%, and delivers a 60% compilation time reduction compared to state-of-the-art solvers. Further optimality studies reveal that ML-SABRE can significantly reduce the optimality gap by up to 82% for SWAP count and 49% for circuit depth, making it well-suited for emerging quantum devices with increasing size and architectural complexity.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Heuristics: Non-Variational QWOA for Weighted Maxcut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present benchmarking results for the non-variational Quantum Walk Optimisation Algorithm (non-variational QWOA) applied to the weighted maxcut problem, using classical simulations for problem sizes up to $n = 31$. The amplified quantum state, prepared using a quadratic number of alternating unitaries, achieves a constant average-case measurement probability for globally optimal solutions across these problem sizes. This behaviour contrasts with that of classical heuristics, which, for NP-hard optimisation problems, typically exhibit solve probabilities that decay as problem size increases. Performance comparisons with two local-search heuristics on the same benchmark instances suggest that the non-variational QWOA may offer a meaningful advantage by scaling more favourably with problem size. These results provide supporting evidence for the potential of this quantum heuristic to achieve quantum advantage, though further work is needed to assess whether the observed performance scaling persists at larger problem sizes, and to confirm whether similar performance trends are observed for the other problem classes to which the non-variational QWOA is designed to generalise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling unitary Fermionic Linear Optics (FLO), or matchgate circuits, has become a fundamental tool in quantum information. Such capability enables a large number of applications ranging from randomized benchmarking of continuous gate sets, to fermionic classical shadows. In this work, we introduce optimal algorithms to sample over the non-particle-preserving (active) and particle-preserving (passive) FLO Haar measures. In particular, we provide appropriate distributions for the gates of $n$-qubit parametrized circuits which produce random active and passive FLO. In contrast to previous approaches, which either incur classical $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ compilation costs or have suboptimal depths, our methods directly output circuits which simultaneously achieve an optimal down-to-the-constant-factor $\Theta(n)$ depth and $\Theta(n^2)$ gate count; with only a $\Theta(n^2)$ classical overhead. Finally, we also provide quantum circuits to sample Clifford FLO with an optimal $\Theta(n^2)$ gate count.</description>

      <title>A double selection entanglement distillation-based state estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of practical quantum communication networks drawing closer, there is a growing need for reliable estimation protocols that can efficiently characterize quantum resources with minimum resource overhead requirement. A novel approach to this problem is to integrate an estimator into an existing network task, thereby removing the need for an additional characterization protocol. In this work, we show that the measurement statistics of a double selection distillation protocol alone can be used to efficiently estimate the Bell-diagonal parameters of the undistilled states, as well as the resulting distilled states after additional post-processing. We also demonstrate that this novel estimator outperforms the previously proposed distillation-based estimator in terms of resource complexity.</description>

      <title>Variational-Adiabatic Quantum Solver for Systems of Linear Equations with Warm Starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a revisited variational quantum solver for linear systems, designed to circumvent the barren plateau phenomenon by combining two key techniques: adiabatic evolution and warm starts. To this end, we define an initial Hamiltonian with a known ground state which is easily implemented on the quantum circuit, and then "adiabatically" evolve the Hamiltonian by tuning a control variable in such a way that the final ground state matches the solution to the given linear system. This evolution is carried out in incremental steps, and the ground state at each step is found by minimizing the energy using the parameter values corresponding to the previous minimum as a warm start to guide the search. As a first test case, the method is applied to several linear systems obtained by discretizing a one-dimensional heat flow equation with different physical assumptions and grid choices. Our method successfully and reliably improves upon the solution to the same problem as obtained by a conventional quantum solver, reaching very close to the global minimum also in the case of very shallow circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Spin vs. position conjugation in quantum simulations with atoms: application to quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The permutation symmetry is a fundamental attribute of the collective wavefunction of indistinguishable particles. It makes a difference for the behavior of collective systems having different quantum statistics but existing in the same environment. Here we show that for some specific quantum conjugation between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom the indistinguishable particles can behave similarly for either quantum statistics. In particular, a mesoscopically scaled collection of atomic qubits, mediated by optical tweezers, can model the behavior of a valent electronic shell compounded with nuclear centers in molecules. This makes possible quantum simulations of mono and divalent bonds in quantum chemistry by manipulation of up to four bosonic atoms confined with optical microtraps.</description>

      <title>Complex wave functions, CPT and quantum field theory for classical generalized Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models.
  We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$).
  A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions.
  Two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions.
  Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables.
  For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations.
  These automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution.
  PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions.
  For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.</description>

      <title>Disordering a permutation symmetric system: revivals, thermalization and chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of introducing a symmetry breaking disorder on the dynamics of a system invariant under particle permutation. The disorder forces quantum states, confined to the $N+1$ dimensional completely symmetric space to penetrate the exponentially large $2^N$ dimensional Hilbert space of $N$ particles. In particular, we focus on the quantum kicked top as a Floquet system of $N$ qubits, and use linear entropy, measuring single qubit entanglement, to investigate the changes in the time scales and values of saturation when disorder is introduced. In the near-integrable regime of the kicked top, we study the robustness of quantum revivals to disorder. We also find that a classical calculation yields the quantum single qubit entanglement to remarkable accuracy in the disorder free limit. The disorder, on the other hand, is modeled in the form of noise which again fits well with the numerical calculations. We measure the extent to which the dynamics is retained within the symmetric subspace and its spreading to the full Hilbert space using different quantities. We show that increasing disorder drives the system to a chaotic phase in full Hilbert space, as also supported by the spectral statistics. We find that there is robustness to disorder in the system, and this is a function of how chaotic the kicked top is.</description>

      <title>A universal constraint for relaxation rates for quantum Markov generators: complete positivity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation rates are key characteristics of quantum processes, as they determine how quickly a quantum system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres, and dissipates. While they play a crucial role in theoretical analyses, relaxation rates are also often directly accessible through experimental measurements. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint: the maximal rate is upper-bounded by the sum of all rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. In this work, we present a new, purely algebraic proof of this constraint. Remarkably, our approach is not only more direct but also allows for a natural generalization beyond completely positive semigroups. We show that complete positivity can be relaxed to 2-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint. This reveals that the bound is more subtle than previously understood: 2-positivity is necessary, but even when further relaxed to Schwarz maps, a slightly weaker -- yet still non-trivial -- universal constraint still holds. Finally, we explore the connection between these bounds and the number of steady states in quantum processes, uncovering a deeper structure underlying their behavior.</description>

      <title>Predictability of quantum observables: Applications in QKD and top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify and optimize the predictability of local observables in bipartite quantum systems by employing the Bayes risk and the inference variance, two measures rooted in statistical learning theory. Specifically, we minimized these quantities when the prediction is improved by an additional quantum system, providing analytical expressions for arbitrary two-qubit states, and showcasing a connection with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. Then, we embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, yielding asymptotically higher secure-key rates than standard BB84 under realistic noise. We applied these results to Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and spin correlation in top-antitop quark pairs from high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Strongly driven transmon as an incoherent noise source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under strong drives, which are becoming necessary for fast high-fidelity operations, transmons can be structurally unstable. Due to chaotic effects, the computational manifold is no longer well separated from the remainder of the spectrum, which correlates with enhanced offset-charge sensitivity and destructive effects in readout. We show here that these detrimental effects can further propagate to other degrees of freedom, for example to neighboring qubits in a multi-qubit system. Specifically, a coherently driven transmon can act as a source of incoherent noise to another circuit element coupled to it. By using a full quantum model and a semiclassical analysis, we perform the noise spectroscopy of the driven transmon coupled to a spectator two-level system (TLS), and we show that, in a certain limit, the interaction with the driven transmon can be modeled as a stochastic diffusive process driving the TLS.</description>

      <title>Bias-field-free operation of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond for accurate vector magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of vector magnetic fields is critical for applications including navigation, geoscience, and space exploration. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin ensembles offer a promising solution for high-sensitivity vector magnetometry, as their different orientations in the diamond lattice measure different components of the magnetic field. However, the bias magnetic field typically used to separate signals from each NV orientation introduces inaccuracy from drifts in permanent magnets or coils. Here, we present a novel bias-field-free approach that labels the NV orientations via the direction of the microwave (MW) field in a variable-pulse-duration Ramsey sequence used to manipulate the spin ensemble. Numerical simulations demonstrate the possibility to isolate each orientation's signal with sub-nT accuracy even without precise MW field calibration, at only a moderate cost to sensitivity. We also provide proof-of-principle experimental validation, observing relevant features that evolve as expected with applied magnetic field. Looking forward, by removing a key source of drift, the proposed protocol lays the groundwork for future deployment of NV magnetometers in high-accuracy or long-duration missions.</description>

      <title>Sample-optimal learning of quantum states using gentle measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gentle measurements of quantum states do not entirely collapse the initial state. Instead, they provide a post-measurement state at a prescribed trace distance $\alpha$ from the initial state together with a random variable used for quantum learning of the initial state. We introduce here the class of $\alpha-$locally-gentle measurements ($\alpha-$LGM) on a finite dimensional quantum system which are product measurements on product states and prove a strong quantum Data-Processing Inequality (qDPI) on this class using an improved relation between gentleness and quantum differential privacy. We further show a gentle quantum Neyman-Pearson lemma which implies that our qDPI is asymptotically optimal (for small $\alpha$). This inequality is employed to show that the necessary number of quantum states for prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$ is of order $1/(\epsilon^2 \alpha^2)$ for both quantum tomography and quantum state certification. Finally, we propose an $\alpha-$LGM called quantum Label Switch that attains these bounds. It is a general implementable method to turn any two-outcome measurement into an $\alpha-$LGM.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Signatures of Gaussian Entanglement Beyond Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum thermodynamics in the Gaussian regime provides a promising framework for investigating the energetic role of quantum correlations, particularly in optical systems. In this work, we introduce an entropy-free criterion for entanglement detection in bipartite Gaussian states, rooted in a distinct thermodynamic quantity: ergotropy -- the maximum extractable work via unitary operations. By defining the relative ergotropic gap, which quantifies the disparity between global and local ergotropy, we derive two independent analytical bounds that distinguish entangled from separable states. We show that for a broad class of quantum states, the bounds coincide, making the criterion both necessary and sufficient. We further extend our analysis to certain non-Gaussian states and observe analogous energy-based signatures of quantum correlations. These findings establish a direct operational link between entanglement and energy storage, offering an experimentally accessible approach to entanglement detection in continuous-variable optical platforms.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of converting light into useful work, with a focus on the role of quantum resources in energy harvesting processes. Specifically, we analyze how quantum coherence, non-Gaussianity, and entanglement affect the fluctuations in the energy output of bosonic quantum batteries. Our findings reveal potential pathways to enhance the efficiency and stability of energy extraction from quantum batteries, with implications for the development of quantum thermal machines at the nanoscale. Moreover, this work highlights a tangible thermodynamic quantum advantage, demonstrating how quantum effects can be harnessed to improve the performance of practical energy conversion tasks.</description>

      <title>Co-designed Quantum Discrete Adiabatic Linear System Solver Via Dynamic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing quantum discrete adiabatic approaches are hindered by circuit depth that increases linearly with the number of evolution steps, a significant challenge for current quantum hardware with limited coherence times. To address this, we propose a co-designed framework that synergistically integrates dynamic circuit capabilities with real-time classical processing. This framework reformulates the quantum adiabatic evolution into discrete, dynamically adjustable segments. The unitary operator for each segment is optimized on-the-fly using classical computation, and circuit multiplexing techniques are leveraged to reduce the overall circuit depth scaling from \(O(\text{steps}\times\text{depth}(U))\) to \(O(\text{depth}(U))\). We implement and benchmark a quantum discrete adiabatic linear solver based on this framework for linear systems of \(W \in {2,4,8,16}\) dimensions with condition numbers \(\kappa \in {10,20,30,40,50}\). Our solver successfully overcomes previous depth limitations, maintaining over \(80\%\) solution fidelity even under realistic noise models. Key algorithmic optimizations contributing to this performance include a first-order approximation of the discrete evolution operator, a tailored dynamic circuit design exploiting real-imaginary component separation, and noise-resilient post-processing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super-additivity of quantum channel capacity is an important feature of quantum information theory different from classical theory, which has been attracting attention. Recently a special channel called ``platypus channel'' exhibits super-additive quantum capacity when combined with qudit erasure channels. Here we consider the ``generalized platypus channel'', prove that it has computable channel capacities, such as both private and classical capacity equal to $1$, and in particular, the generalized platypus channel still displays the super-additivity of quantum capacity when combined with qudit erasure channels and multilevel amplitude damping channels respectively.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Camera: Scaling Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Imaging at the Quantum-Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as essential devices that push the boundaries of photon detection with unprecedented sensitivity, ultrahigh timing precision, and broad spectral response. Recent advancements in materials engineering, superconducting electronics integration, and cryogenic system design are enabling the evolution of SNSPDs from single-pixel detectors toward scalable arrays and large-format single-photon time tagging cameras. This perspective article surveys the rapidly evolving technological landscape underpinning this transition, focusing on innovative superconducting materials, advanced multiplexed read-out schemes, and emerging cryo-compatible electronics. We highlight how these developments are set to profoundly impact diverse applications, including quantum communication networks, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy, remote sensing with unprecedented resolution, and the detection of elusive dark matter signals. By critically discussing both current challenges and promising solutions, we aim to articulate a clear, coherent vision for the next generation of SNSPD-based quantum imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Detection with Variational Quantum Interference: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement detection serves as a fundamental task in quantum information science, playing a critical role in quantum benchmarking and foundational studies. As the number of controllable qubits continues to increase, there emerges a pressing demand for scalable and robust entanglement detection protocols that can maintain high detection capability while requiring minimal resources. By integrating the positive partial transposition criterion with variational quantum interference, we develop an entanglement detection protocol that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this protocol attains high detection capability using only shallow quantum circuits, outperforming several widely-used entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms. Experimental implementation on a linear optical platform successfully identifies entanglement in a three-qubit mixed state that cannot be detected by conventional entanglement witnesses. Drawing upon the full potential of quantum and classical resources, our protocol paves a new path for efficient entanglement detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents an intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, aiming to use quantum resources to support model training and inference. This paper reviews recent developments in supervised QML, focusing on methods such as variational quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, and quantum kernel methods, along with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.</description>

Abstract: We investigate phase estimation in a lossy interferometer using entangled coherent states, with particular focus on a scenario where no reference beam is employed. By calculating the quantum Fisher information, we reveal two key results: (1) the metrological equivalence between scenarios with and without a reference beam, established under ideal lossless conditions for the two-phase-shifting configuration,breaks down in the presence of photon loss, and (2) the pronounced inferior performance of entangled coherent states relative to NOON states, observed in the presence of a reference beam, disappears in its absence.</description>

      <title>Mixed state concurrence for symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.</description>

      <title>Realistic quantum network simulation for experimental BBM92 key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide secure key material between two parties without relying on assumptions about the computational power of an eavesdropper. QKD is performed over quantum links and quantum networks, systems which are resource-intensive to deploy and maintain. To evaluate and optimize performance prior to, during, and after deployment, realistic simulations with attention to physical realism are necessary. Quantum network simulators can simulate a variety of quantum and classical protocols and can assist in quantum network design and optimization by offering realism and flexibility beyond mathematical models which rely on simplifying assumptions and can be intractable to solve as network complexity increases. We use a versatile discrete event quantum network simulator to simulate the entanglement-based QKD protocol BBM92 and compare it to our experimental implementation and to existing theory. Furthermore, we simulate secure key rates in a repeater key distribution scenario for which no experimental implementations exist.</description>

      <title>Quantum Acoustics with Tunable Nonlinearity in the Superstrong Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of mechanical modes in the quantum regime is a key resource for quantum technologies, offering promising pathways for quantum sensing with macroscopic systems and scalable architectures for quantum simulation. In this work, we realise a multimode mechanical cavity coupled to a superconducting Kerr resonator, which induces nonlinearity in the mechanical modes. The Kerr mode is realised by a flux-tunable SQUID array resonator, while the mechanical modes are implemented by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavity. Both mechanical and electromagnetic modes are individually addressable via dedicated measurement lines, enabling full spectroscopic characterisation. We introduce a straightforward protocol to measure the SQUID array resonator's participation ratio in the hybrid acoustic modes, quantifying the degree of hybridisation. The participation ratio reveals that our device operates at the onset of the multimode coupling regime, where multiple acoustic modes simultaneously interact with the nonlinear superconducting element. Furthermore, this platform allows controllable Kerr-type nonlinearities in multiple acoustic modes, with the participation ratio serving as the key parameter determining both the dissipation rates and nonlinear strengths of these hybridised modes. Close to the resonant regime, we measure a cross-Kerr interaction between seven pairs of mechanical modes, which is controllable via the SQUID array resonator detuning. These results establish a platform for engineering nonlinear multimode mechanical interactions, offering potential for future integration with superconducting qubits and implementation of multiple mechanical qubits.</description>

      <title>Roughening and dynamics of an electric flux string in a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the roughening transition in the pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory in (2+1) dimensions. Using numerical simulations with matrix product states, we explore the static and dynamical properties of an electric flux string between two static charges as the coupling is varied and approaches the deconfinement phase transition from the confined phase. Within the roughening region, we obtain the universal L\"uscher correction to the confining potential and observe the expected restoration of rotational symmetry. Our simulations of the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a string reveal that the growth of the entanglement entropy of the state and the string width exhibit qualitatively different behavior in the roughening region compared to the deeply confined one. In particular, we find that the rate of entropy growth is consistent with an effective description of the string excitations by a bosonic model in the roughening phase.</description>

      <title>Fully Generalized Spin Models with Strain Effects of Kitaev Spin Liquid Candidate Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ spin model-originally derived for an ideal $P\bar{3}1m$ symmetric geometry-has long served as a central framework for understanding candidate Kitaev materials. In realistic crystals, however, this ideal geometry is seldom realized, either at low temperatures or under external perturbations, limiting the model's quantitative applicability. Here we introduce a fully generalized spin model, denoted $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$, that explicitly incorporates arbitrary lattice deformations $\epsilon$. All spin-exchange interactions and their strain-dependent coefficients are obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and a microscopic derivation of coupling constants for materials based on $d^5$ transition-metal ions. For $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under a strain of $3\%$, new emergent exchange channels acquire magnitudes comparable to their unstrained counterparts. Building on these parameters, we investigate strain-driven quantum phase transitions between competing magnetic states-including the zigzag order and the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL)-and identify a strain-induced topological transition within the KQSL states that offers a practical diagnostic of Kitaev physics. Furthermore, our symmetry analysis of the $\epsilon$-$KJ\Gamma\Gamma'$ model is applicable to both $d^{5}$ ions, such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and $d^{7}$ systems, including cobalt-based compounds.</description>

      <title>Diffraction phase-free Bragg atom interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bragg diffraction is a fundamental technique used to enhance the sensitivity of atom interferometers through large momentum transfer, making these devices among the most precise quantum sensors available today. To further improve their accuracy, it is necessary to achieve control over multiple interferometer paths and increase robustness against velocity spread. Optimal control theory has recently led to advancements in sensitivity and robustness under specific conditions, such as vibrations, accelerations, and other experimental challenges. In this work, we employ this tool to focus on improving the accuracy of the interferometer by minimizing the diffraction phase. We consider the finite temperature of the incoming wavepacket and the multi-path nature of high-order Bragg diffraction as showcased in a Mach-Zehnder(MZ) geometry. Our approach can achieve diffraction phases on the order of microradians or even below a microradian for a momentum width of the incoming wavepacket $\sigma_p = 0.01\hbar k$, below a milliradian for $\sigma_p= 0.1 \hbar k$ and milliradians for $\sigma_p = 0.3 \hbar k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have been widely used in computational physics to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). In this study, we propose an energy-embedding-based physics-informed neural network method for solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation to obtain ground- and excited-state wave functions, as well as energy eigenvalues by incorporating an embedding layer to generate process-driven data. The method demonstrates high accuracy for several well-known potentials, such as the infinite potential well, harmonic oscillator potential, Woods-Saxon potential, and double-well potential. Further validation shows that the method also performs well in solving the radial Coulomb potential equation, showcasing its adaptability and extensibility. The proposed approach can be extended to solve other partial differential equations beyond the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and holds promise for applications in high-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne detection of low-frequency fields via Rydberg EIT with phase demodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the rapid progress of quantum sensing research reveals that the Rydberg atoms have great potentials in becoming high-precision centimeter-scale antenna of low-frequency fields. In order to facilitate efficient and reliable detection of low-frequency fields via Rydberg atoms, we design, implement and analyze a special but low-cost and scalable method based on heterodyning processes under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) embedded in typical two-photon ground-Rydberg transition. Instead of relying on observing changes in absorption of light by Rydberg atoms, our method focuses on the phase modulation effect on the probe laser induced by the low-frequency fields via the Rydberg EIT mechanism and utilizes a demodulation process to accurately retrieve the signal. The general principles of our method apply to both electric and magnetic fields and it is even possible to realize the combination of both functionalities in the same apparatus. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate the full cycle of operations with respect to both cases. In the measurement of low-frequency electric fields, we discover that the Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction among atoms induce linear superposition of Rydberg states with different angular momentum that generates a first-order response corresponding to the signature of linear Stark effect. As the Rydberg atoms have excellent coupling strengths with electric fields, our results indicate that our method can hopefully reach high-precision performance for practical tasks in the future.</description>

      <title>NbTiN Nanowire Resonators for Spin-Photon Coupling on Solid Neon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons floating on a solid neon exhibit long charge coherence times, making them attractive for hybrid quantum systems. When combined with high-quality, high-impedance superconducting resonators and a local magnetic field gradient, this platform enables strong charge-photon and spin-charge coupling -- key ingredients for scalable spin qubit architectures. In this work, we fabricated NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators and measured internal quality factors around $10^5$. We successfully deposited several hundred-nanometer-thick layers of solid neon, followed by gradual electron loading. The presence of neon and electrons was confirmed via resonance frequency shifts without degradation of the resonator's quality factor. These results demonstrate that NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators are compatible with electrons-on-neon systems and suitable for future qubit experiments. We further performed a theoretical analysis of optimized micro-magnet configurations, showing that spin qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.99% for single-qubit and 99.9% for two-qubit operations are achievable using natural neon at the charge sweet spot.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. In this work, a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm is applied to the MBHB signals. It is demonstrated that the quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results indicate that the quantum-enhanced approach significantly reduces computational costs. However, it is also found that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. This highlights the need for more robust and stable quantum search strategies.</description>

      <title>QGAN-based data augmentation for hybrid quantum-classical neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks converge faster and achieve higher accuracy than classical models. However, data augmentation in quantum machine learning remains underexplored. To tackle data scarcity, we integrate quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) with hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) to develop an augmentation framework. We propose two strategies: a general approach to enhance data processing and classification across HQCNNs, and a customized strategy that dynamically generates samples tailored to the HQCNN's performance on specific data categories, improving its ability to learn from complex datasets. Simulation experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate that QGAN outperforms traditional data augmentation methods and classical GANs. Compared to baseline DCGAN, QGAN achieves comparable performance with half the parameters, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. This suggests that QGANs can simplify models and generate high-quality data, enhancing HQCNN accuracy and performance. These findings pave the way for applying quantum data augmentation techniques in machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Doppler-broadening thermometry (DBT) can be used as a calibration-free primary reference suitable for practical applications, e.g. reliably measuring temperatures over long periods of time in environments where sensor retrieval is impractical. We report on our proof-of-concept investigations into DBT with alkali metal vapour cells, with a particular focus on both absorption and frequency accuracy during scans. We reach sub-kelvin temperature accuracy, and experimental absorption fit residuals below $0.05\,\%$, in a simple setup. The outlook for portable, practical devices is bright, with clear prospects for future improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two recent, prominent theorems--the "no-go theorem for observer-independent facts" and the "Local Friendliness no-go theorem"--employ so-called extended Wigner's friend scenarios to try to impose novel, non-trivial constraints on the possible nature of physical reality. While the former is argued to entail that there can be no theory in which the results of Wigner and his friend can both be considered objective, the latter is said to place on reality stronger constraints than the Bell and Kochen-Specker theorems. Here, I conduct a thorough analysis of these theorems and show that they suffer from a list of shortcomings that question their validity and limit their strength. I conclude that the "no-go theorem for observer-independent facts" and the "Local Friendliness no-go theorem" fail to impose significant constraints on the nature of physical reality.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the modeling of the spread of information through a complex, multi-layered network, where the information is transferred from an initial transmitter to a final receiver. The mathematical model is deduced within the framework of operatorial methods, according to the formal mathematical apparatus typical of quantum mechanics. Two different approaches are considered: one based on the ($H,\rho$)-induced dynamics and one on the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation. For each method, numerical results are presented.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of dynamical signatures of chaos in quantum kicked top</title>

Abstract: A host of dynamical measures of quantum correlations -- out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOC), Loschmidt echo, generalized entanglement and observational entropy -- are useful to infer the underlying classical chaotic dynamics in quantum regime. In this work, these measures are employed to analyse quantum kicked top with kick strength $k$. It is shown that, despite the differences in their definitions, these measures are periodic with $k$, and the periodicity depends on the number of spins represented by the kicked top. The periodic behaviour arises from the structure of the kicked top Floquet operator and spans the regime in which the corresponding classical dynamics is predominantly chaotic. We also point to the reflection symmetry in Loschmidt echo and a special case of time periodicity in OTOC. This result can guide experiments towards the right choice of kick strengths to avoid repetitive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unifying non-Markovian characterisation with an efficient and self-consistent framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise on quantum devices is much more complex than it is commonly given credit. Far from usual models of decoherence, nearly all quantum devices are plagued both by a continuum of environments and temporal instabilities. These induce noisy quantum and classical correlations at the level of the circuit. The relevant spatiotemporal effects are difficult enough to understand, let alone combat. There is presently a lack of either scalable or complete methods to address the phenomena responsible for scrambling and loss of quantum information. Here, we make deep strides to remedy this problem. We establish a theoretical framework that uniformly incorporates and classifies all non-Markovian phenomena. Our framework is universal, assumes no parameters values, and is written entirely in terms of experimentally accessible circuit-level quantities. We formulate an efficient reconstruction using tensor network learning, allowing also for easy modularisation and simplification based on the expected physics of the system. This is then demonstrated through both extensive numerical studies and implementations on IBM Quantum devices, estimating a comprehensive set of spacetime correlations. Finally, we conclude our analysis with applications thereof to the efficacy of control techniques to counteract these effects -- including noise-aware circuit compilation and optimised dynamical decoupling. We find significant improvements are possible in the diamond norm and average gate fidelity of arbitrary $SU(4)$ operations, as well as related decoupling improvements in contrast to off-the-shelf schemes.</description>

      <title>Simple Diagonal State Designs with Reconfigurable Real-Time Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary designs are widely used in quantum computation, but in many practical settings it suffices to construct a diagonal state design generated with unitary gates diagonal in the computational basis. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient diagonal state 3-design based on real-time evolutions under 2-local Hamiltonians. Our construction is inspired by the classical Girard-Hutchinson trace estimator in that it involves the stochastic preparation of many random-phase states. Though the exact Girard-Hutchinson states are not tractably implementable on a quantum computer, we can construct states that match the statistical moments of the Girard-Hutchinson states with real-time evolution. Importantly, our random states are all generated using the same Hamiltonians for real-time evolution, with the randomness arising solely from stochastic variations in the durations of the evolutions. In this sense, the circuit is fully reconfigurable and thus suited for near-term realizations on both digital and analog platforms. Moreover, we show how to extend our construction to achieve diagonal state designs of arbitrarily high order.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for calculating determinant and inverse of matrix and solving linear algebraic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16619v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose quantum algorithms, purely quantum in nature, for calculating the determinant and inverse of an $(N-1)\times (N-1)$ matrix (depth is $O(N^2\log N)$) which is a simple modification of the algorithm for calculating the determinant of an $N\times N$ matrix (depth is $O(N\log^2 N)$. The basic idea is to encode each row of the matrix into a pure state of some quantum system. In addition, we use the representation of the elements of the inverse matrix in terms of algebraic complements. This algorithm together with that for matrix multiplication { proposed earlier} yields the algorithm for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (depth is $O(N\log^2 N)$. Measurement of the ancilla state with output 1 (probability is $\sim 2^{-O(N\log N)}$) removes the garbage acquired during calculation. Appropriate circuits for all three algorithms are presented and have the same estimation $O(N\log N)$ for the space (number of qubits in the circuit).</description>

      <title>Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. As an application, we show that
  - Purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states.
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(r^2/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing the Schmidt rank of bipartite states with perfect completeness, settling an open question raised in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf (ToC 2016).
  - A lower bound $\Omega((\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{r})\cdot\sqrt{r}/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether an $n$-partite state is a matrix product state of bond dimension $r$ or $\varepsilon$-far, improving the prior lower bounds $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)$ by Soleimanifar and Wright (SODA 2022) and $\Omega(\sqrt{r})$ by Aaronson et al. (ITCS 2024).
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a $d$-dimensional bipartite state is maximally entangled or $\varepsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015) is optimal for this task.
  We also show other applications in sample complexity and query complexity. In addition, our central result can be extended when the tested state is mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies present new opportunities for fundamental tests of nature. One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Quantum Optimization via Counterdiabatic Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the fundamental variational quantum algorithms, while a version of QAOA that includes counterdiabatic driving, termed Digitized Counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA), is generally considered to outperform QAOA for all system sizes when the circuit depth for the two algorithms are held equal. Nevertheless, DC-QAOA introduces more CNOT gates per layer, so the overall circuit complexity is a tradeoff between the number of CNOT gates per layer and the circuit depth and must be carefully assessed. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DC-QAOA and QAOA on MaxCut problem with the total number of CNOT gates held equal, and we focus on one implementation of counterdiabatic terms using nested commutators in DC-QAOA, termed as DC-QAOA(NC). We have found that DC-QAOA(NC) reduces the overall circuit complexity as compared to QAOA only for sufficiently large problems, and for MaxCut problem the number of qubits must exceed 16 for DC-QAOA(NC) to outperform QAOA. Additionally, we benchmark DC-QAOA(NC) against QAOA on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model under realistic noise conditions, finding that DC-QAOA(NC) exhibits significantly improved robustness compared to QAOA, maintaining higher fidelity as the problem size scales. Notably, in a direct comparison between one-layer DC-QAOA(NC) and three-layer QAOA where both use the same number of CNOT gates, we identify an exponential performance advantage for DC-QAOA(NC), further signifying its suitability for large-scale quantum optimization tasks. Moreover, based on our finding, we have devised an instance-sequential training method for DC-QAOA(NC) circuits, which, compared to traditional methods, offers performance improvement while using even fewer quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Quantum DeepONet: Neural operators accelerated by quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of computational science and engineering, constructing models that reflect real-world phenomena requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with different conditions. Recent advancements in neural operators, such as deep operator network (DeepONet), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, promise efficient computation of PDE solutions for a new condition in a single forward pass. However, classical DeepONet entails quadratic complexity concerning input dimensions during evaluation. Given the progress in quantum algorithms and hardware, here we propose to utilize quantum computing to accelerate DeepONet evaluations, yielding complexity that is linear in input dimensions. Our proposed quantum DeepONet integrates unary encoding and orthogonal quantum layers. We benchmark our quantum DeepONet using a variety of PDEs, including the antiderivative operator, advection equation, and Burgers' equation. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in both ideal and noisy conditions. Furthermore, we show that our quantum DeepONet can also be informed by physics, minimizing its reliance on extensive data collection. Quantum DeepONet will be particularly advantageous in applications in outer loop problems which require exploring parameter space and solving the corresponding PDEs, such as uncertainty quantification and optimal experimental design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly increasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design. Equivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise during compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in quantum circuit verification. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) for determining the equivalence of quantum circuits. Our approach contracts tensorized quantum gates from two circuits into an intermediary MPO, exploiting their reversibility to determine their equivalence or non-equivalence. Our results show that this method offers significant scalability improvements over existing methods, with polynomial scaling in circuit width and depth for the practical use cases we explore. We expect that this work sets the new standard for scalable equivalence checking of quantum circuits and will become a crucial tool for the validation of increasingly complex quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: In the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model, the time dependence in the coupling parameter allows changes in the forms of the Rabi oscillations. In the inverse problem approach (IPA), the time-dependent coupling parameter is obtained from the resulting population inversion. In this work, we employ the IPA to obtain a time-dependent coupling that reproduces the effects of $\kappa$-deformation in the population inversion of an undeformed JC. This is relevant because it may pave the way for simulating quantum deformation in the JC model and possibly enable an experimental verification in a setting where the coupling can be precisely controlled.</description>

Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.</description>

Abstract: In this short review we describe the process of designing a superconducting circuit device for quantum information applications. We discuss the factors that must be considered to implement a desired effective Hamiltonian on a device. We describe the translation between a device's physical layout, the circuit graph, and the effective Hamiltonian. We go over the process of electromagnetic simulation of a device layout to predict its behavior. We also discuss concerns such as connectivity, crosstalk suppression, and radiation shielding, and how they affect both on-chip design and enclosure structures. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in superconducting quantum circuit design and acts as a starter document for researchers working on any of these challenges.</description>

Abstract: Quantum chemistry is among the most promising applications of quantum computing, offering the potential to solve complex electronic structure problems more efficiently than classical approaches. A critical component of any quantum algorithm is the measurement step, where the desired properties are extracted from a quantum computer. This review focuses on recent advancements in quantum measurement techniques tailored for quantum chemistry, particularly within the second quantized framework suitable for current and near-term quantum hardware. We provide a comprehensive overview of measurement strategies developed primarily for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its derivatives. These strategies address the inherent challenges posed by complexity of the electronic Hamiltonian operator. Additionally, we examine methods for estimating excited states and one- and two-electron properties, extending the applicability of quantum algorithms to broader chemical phenomena. Key aspects of the review include approaches for constructing measurement operators with reduced classical preprocessing and quantum implementation costs, techniques to minimize the number of measurements required for a given accuracy, and error mitigation strategies that leverage symmetries and other properties of the measurement operators. Furthermore, we explore measurement schemes rooted in Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which are expected to become viable with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing. This review emphasizes foundational concepts and methodologies rather than numerical benchmarks, serving as a resource for researchers aiming to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum measurements in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Reservoir-assisted quantum battery charging at finite temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is to maximize the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we applied quantum feedback control to the charger and investigated the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. In particular, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explored the impact of battery size and found that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation</title>

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline that realigns the received echoes so that the energy from a target is concentrated in a single range bin across all azimuth positions. The performance of the quantum RCMC is evaluated and compared against its classical counterpart, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in advanced SAR imaging.</description>

      <title>Large amplitude mechanical coherent states and detection of weak nonlinearities in cavity optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of large-amplitude coherent states of a massive mechanical resonator, and their quantum-limited detection represent useful tools for quantum sensing and for testing fundamental physics theories. In fact, any weak perturbation may affect the coherent quantum evolution of the prepared state, providing a sensitive probe for such a perturbation. Here we consider a cavity optomechanical setup and the case of the detection of a weak mechanical nonlinearity. We consider different strategies, first focusing on the stationary dynamics in the presence of multiple tones driving the system, and then focusing on non-equilibrium dynamical strategies. These methods can be successfully applied for measuring Duffing-like material nonlinearities, or effective nonlinear corrections associated with quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Quantum Molecular Autoencoder (MolQAE), the first quantum autoencoder to leverage the complete molecular structures. MolQAE uniquely maps SMILES strings directly to quantum states using parameterized rotation gates, preserving vital structural information. Its quantum encoder-decoder framework enables latent space compression and reconstruction. A dual-objective strategy optimizes fidelity and minimizes trash state deviation. Our evaluations demonstrate effective capture of molecular characteristics and a remarkable preservation of fidelity, approaching robust molecular reconstruction even with substantial dimensionality reduction. Our model establishes a quantum pathway in cheminformatics by being the first to process complete molecular structural information with a dedicated quantum architecture considering the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era development and promising significant advances in drug and materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Quantum-Secure Communications in a Nuclear Reactor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD), one of the latest cryptographic techniques, founded on the laws of quantum mechanics rather than mathematical complexity, promises for the first time unconditional secure remote communications. Integrating this technology into the next generation nuclear systems - designed for universal data collection and real-time sharing as well as cutting-edge instrumentation and increased dependency on digital technologies - could provide significant benefits enabling secure, unattended, and autonomous operation in remote areas, e.g., microreactors and fission batteries. However, any practical implementation on a critical reactor system must meet strict requirements on latency, control system compatibility, stability, and performance under operational transients. Here, we report the complete end-to-end demonstration of a phase-encoding decoy-state BB84 protocol QKD system under prototypic conditions on Purdue's fully digital nuclear reactor, PUR-1. The system was installed in PUR-1 successfully executing real-time encryption and decryption of 2,000 signals over optic fiber distances up to 82 km using OTP-based encryption and up to 140 km with AES-based encryption. For a core of 68 signals, OTP-secure communication was achieved for up to 135 km. The QKD system maintained a stable secret key rate of 320 kbps and a quantum bit error of 3.8% at 54 km. Our results demonstrate that OTP-based encryption introduces minimal latency while the more key-efficient AES and ASCON encryption schemes can significantly increase the number of signals encrypted without latency penalties. Additionally, implementation of a dynamic key pool ensures several hours of secure key availability during potential system downtimes. This work shows the potential of quantum-based secure remote communications for future digitally driven nuclear reactor technologies.</description>

      <title>The 2-Category of Topological Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary Ribbon Fusion Categories (URFC) formalize anyonic theories. It has been widely assumed that the same category formalizes a topological quantum computing model. However, in previous work, we addressed and resolved this confusion and demonstrated while the former could be any fusion category, the latter is always a subcategory of Hilb. In this paper, we argue that a categorical formalism that captures and unifies both anyonic theories (the Hardware of quantum computing) and a model of topological quantum computing is a braided (fusion) 2-category. In this 2-category, 0-morphisms describe anyonic types and Hom-categories describe different models of quantum computing. This picture provides an insightful perspective on superselection rules. It presents furthermore a clear distinction between fusion of anyons versus tensor products as defined in linear algebra, between vector spaces of 1-morphisms. The former represents a monoidal product and sum between 0-morphisms and the latter a tensor product and direct sum between 1-morphisms.</description>

Abstract: The Hilbert transform has been one of the foundational transforms in signal processing, finding it's way into multiple disciplines from cryptography to biomedical sciences. However, there does not exist any quantum analogue for the Hilbert transform. In this work, we introduce a formulation for the quantum Hilbert transform (QHT)and apply it to a quantum steganography protocol. By bridging classical phase-shift techniques with quantum operations, QHT opens new pathways in quantum signal processing, communications, sensing, and secure information hiding.</description>

Abstract: We present a graphical framework to represent entanglement in three-qubit states. The geometry associated with each entanglement class and type is analyzed, revealing distinct structural features. We explore the connection between this geometric perspective and the tangle, deriving bounds that depend on the entanglement class. Based on these insights, we conjecture a purely geometric expression for both the tangle and Cayley's hyperdeterminant for non-generic states. As an application, we analyze the energy eigenstates of physical Hamiltonians, identifying the sufficient conditions for genuine tripartite entanglement to be robust under symmetry-breaking perturbations and level repulsion effects.</description>

      <title>AC-Stark Spectroscopy of Interactions between Moir\'e Excitons and Polarons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy to study optical excitations in a charge-tunable MoSe$_2$\WS$_2$ moir\'e heterostructure. An intense red-detuned laser pulse creates a photonic dressing of the material by introducing a large virtual population of excitons or exciton polarons in a deep moir\'e potential. By measuring the resulting ac Stark effect with a weak resonant laser pulse, we gain access to the nature and mutual interactions of the elementary optical excitations. At charge neutrality, our measurements reveal that different exciton resonances, associated with confinement of their center-of-mass motion in the moir\'e potential, have a significant spatial overlap. The resulting short-range interactions manifest themselves as a density-dependent blueshift for same-valley excitons and bound biexciton states for opposite-valley excitons. The attractive polaron resonance that appears upon injection of electrons into the heterostructure shows a contrasting behavior: Here, we observe an electron-density-independent light shift and a clear pump-power-dependent saturation. These features are equivalent to that of an ensemble of independent two-level emitters and indicate a breakdown of the Fermi-polaron picture for optical excitations of electrons subject to a strong moir\'e potential. Our work establishes an experimental approach to elucidate the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor moir\'e heterostructures, providing a solid ground for the spectroscopy of correlated electronic and excitonic states in such materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a relational notion of a subsystem in theories of matrix quantum mechanics and show how the corresponding entanglement entropy can be given as a minimisation, exhibiting many similarities to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Our construction brings together the physics of entanglement edge modes, noncommutative geometry and quantum internal reference frames, to define a subsystem whose reduced state is (approximately) an incoherent sum of density matrices, corresponding to distinct spatial subregions. We show that in states where geometry emerges from semiclassical matrices, this sum is dominated by the subregion with minimal boundary area. As in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it is the computation of the entanglement that determines the subregion. We find that coarse-graining is essential in our microscopic derivation, in order to control the proliferation of highly curved and disconnected non-geometric subregions in the sum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model exhibits a superradiant phase transition when the coupling becomes strong, even though it involves only two components: a two-level atom and a single bosonic mode. This phase transition is referred to as a finite-component quantum phase transition, in contrast to conventional phase transitions in many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate heat transport across an atom embedded in bosonic modes, modeled by the quantum Rabi model, between two thermal baths. We found a manifestation of the superradiant phase transition in the thermal conductance, which represents the linear response to a temperature bias. Our Letter can be helpful for the development of quantum heat devices utilizing controllable finite-component quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.</description>
