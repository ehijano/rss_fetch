      <title>Volumetric ultrasound imaging with a sparse matrix array and integrated fiber-optic sensing for robust needle tracking in interventional procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, is essential for the safe and effective guidance of minimally invasive procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for needle guidance, but the two-dimensional nature of most clinical probes limits accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization, particularly of the needle tip. We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. This proof-of-concept system enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and 3D needle tip tracking, with strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Unrolled Network for Portable MR Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for numerous diagnostic tasks, yet its usefulness is tempered due to its high cost and infrastructural requirements. Low-cost very-low-field portable scanners offer new opportunities, while enabling imaging outside conventional MRI suites. However, achieving diagnostic-quality images in clinically acceptable scan times remains challenging with these systems. Therefore methods for improving the image quality while reducing the scan duration are highly desirable. Here, we investigate a physics-informed 3D deep unrolled network for the reconstruction of portable MR acquisitions. Our approach includes a novel network architecture that utilizes momentum-based acceleration and leverages complex conjugate symmetry of k-space for improved reconstruction performance. Comprehensive evaluations on emulated datasets as well as 47mT portable MRI acquisitions demonstrate the improved reconstruction quality of the proposed method compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous determination of wave speed, diffusivity and nonlinearity in the Westervelt equation using complex time-periodic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem governed by the Westervelt equation with linear diffusivity and quadratic-type nonlinearity. The objective of this problem is to recover all the coefficients of this nonlinear partial differential equation. We show that, by constructing complex-valued time-periodic solutions excited from the boundary time-harmonically at a sufficiently high frequency, knowledge of the first- and second-harmonic Cauchy data at the boundary is sufficient to simultaneously determine the wave speed, diffusivity and nonlinearity in the interior of the domain of interest.</description>

      <title>Optimized Designs for High-Efficiency Particle Sorting in Serpentine Microfluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient particle sorting in microfluidic systems is vital for advancements in biomedical diagnostics and industrial applications. This study numerically investigates particle migration and passive sorting in symmetric serpentine microchannels, leveraging inertial and centrifugal forces for label-free, high-throughput separation. Using a two-dimensional numerical model, particle dynamics were analyzed across varying flow rates, diameter ratios (1.2, 1.5, and 2), and channel configurations. The optimized serpentine geometry achieved particle separation efficiencies exceeding 95% and throughput greater than 99%.A novel scaling framework was developed to predict the minimum number of channel loops required for efficient sorting. Additionally, the robustness of the proposed scaling framework is demonstrated by its consistency with findings from previous studies, which exhibit the same trend as predicted by the scaling laws, underscoring the universality and reliability of the model. Additionally, the study revealed the significant influence of density ratio ({\alpha}) on sorting efficiency, where higher {\alpha} values enhanced separation through amplified hydrodynamic forces. Optimal flow rates tailored to particle sizes were identified, enabling the formation of focused particle streaks for precise sorting. However, efficiency declined beyond these thresholds due to particle entrapment in micro-vortices or boundary layers. This work provides valuable insights and design principles for developing compact, cost-effective microfluidic systems, with broad applications in biomedical fields like cell sorting and pathogen detection, as well as industrial processes requiring precise particle handlin</description>

      <title>Very-low-field MRI scanners: from the ideal to the real permanent magnet array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very-low-field MRIs are becoming increasingly popular due to their portability and adaptability to different environments. They are being successfully used for various clinical applications, leading to a paradigm shift in the way imaging care is typically performed. The development of low-cost MRI scanner prototypes began a few years ago, with some interesting and promising open-source projects emerging in both hardware and software design. Using permanent magnets (PMs) to generate the static magnetic field B0 can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost of low-field scanners while achieving satisfactory homogeneity. This article focuses on characterizing magnet performance in terms of B0 spatial homogeneity. Specifically, it investigates its sensitivity to various factors and explores the reasons for discrepancies between numerical expectations and actual measurements on fabricated magnets. The analysis also examines the consequences of using different numerical model approximations, revisiting concepts most frequently used in other design contexts. While these assumptions simplify the numerical model and may improve its performance in terms of computational time, this paper demonstrates that they also impact the reliability of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Time-series Neutron Tomography of Rhizoboxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of tilt-series neutron tomography for analyzing rhizoboxes used in root-soil interaction studies. Traditional neutron imaging methods are limited by constrained root growth volumes and poor penetration in moist soil. Using a vertical acquisition axis, the tilt-series approach avoids constraints typical of laminography. This method allows simultaneous radiographic and tomographic data acquisition, enhancing time resolution and providing detailed insights into root networks and soil water content. Experiments involved scanning six-week-old maize plants in rhizoboxes filled with sand. Results show that tilt-series tomography can effectively reconstruct root networks despite some artifacts from the missing wedge. While the tilt-series tomographic data qualitatively reveal water distribution changes, radiographic data remain essential for quantitative analysis. This approach demonstrates the potential for dynamic root-soil interaction studies, offering a valuable tool for agricultural and environmental research by providing comprehensive insights into the rhizosphere.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Low-field MRI: From Compressed Sensing to Deep Learning Reconstruction with CNNs and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portable, low-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners are increasingly being deployed in clinical settings. However, key barriers to their widespread use include low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), generally low image quality, and long scan durations. Hence, methods for accelerating acquisition and boosting image quality are critically important to enable clinically actionable, high-quality imaging in these systems. Despite the role that compressed sensing (CS) and deep learning (DL)-based methods have played in improving image quality for high-field MRI, their adoption for low-field imaging is still in its infancy, and it remains unclear how robust these methods are in low-SNR regimes.
  Here, we propose, investigate, and compare four reconstruction approaches: (i) L1-wavelet CS; (ii) a data-driven network; (iii) an unrolled network; and (iv) a Swin Transformer Cascade. We evaluate their performance across a range of SNR values using publicly available datasets and ultra-low field (6.5 mT) MRI data. Our results show that the unrolled network and Swin Transformer cascade outperform CS and data-driven models. While transformer-based models achieve the highest performance at high SNR, unrolled convolution-based networks are more robust in ultra-low SNR settings and often outperform transformers, indicating that simpler DL architectures may be better suited to low-field MRI.
  This work highlights both the potential and limitations of advanced reconstruction techniques in low-field MRI and pinpoints effective DL strategies for addressing SNR challenges.</description>

      <title>A framework for rapid, reproducible, and high-fidelity whole-brain multi-pool CEST imaging at 3T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate a framework for rapid, accurate, and reproducible whole-brain, multi-pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging at 3T, addressing challenges of long acquisition times and confounding factors. Methods: A single-shot 3D true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True FISP) sequence was optimized for whole-brain multi-pool CEST. Rapid B0, B1, and T1 mapping was performed using a dual-echo modified four-angle method. A feed-forward neural network was developed for rapid B1 correction, trained against the conventional multi-power method. The apparent exchange-dependent relaxation (AREX) metric was used to correct for T1 and magnetization transfer (MT) effects. The framework was validated in phantoms and healthy human subjects (N=8), including a test-retest reproducibility assessment. Results: The True FISP sequence yielded high-quality, whole-brain images with minimal artifacts and distortion in a clinically feasible scan time (~9 minutes). Phantom studies confirmed the effectiveness of B1 correction (coefficient of variation [CV] for MT_MTRLD decreased from 22.49% to 4.61%) and AREX-based confounder correction (CV for APT_AREX reduced from 33.6% to 6.9%). The neural network B1 correction showed excellent agreement with the conventional multi-power method in vivo (ICC &gt; 0.97). High test-retest reproducibility was demonstrated across 96 brain regions, with the average CV for APT_AREX under 10% for over 95% of regions. Conclusion: A rapid and robust framework for whole-brain quantitative multi-pool CEST imaging was successfully developed and validated. By integrating an efficient acquisition sequence with a streamlined correction pipeline, this approach overcomes key barriers to clinical translation, enabling reliable metabolic imaging for widespread brain pathologies.</description>

      <title>Active Eye Lens Dosimetry With Dosepix: Influence of Measurement Position and Lead Glass Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the effect of the measurement position on measurements of $H_\text{p}(3)$ of a new active eye lens dosemeter prototype based on the Dosepix detector is examined. A comparison between measuring directly in front of the eye and measuring at the side of the head of an Alderson phantom showed no significant influence on the resulting $H_\text{p}(3)$ for different radiation qualities and angles. In addition, to account for the absorption effect of radiation safety glasses, pieces of lead glass were attached to the front and side of the dosemeter. Corresponding effects and consequences for radiation protection measurements have been investigated by using a human like Alderson head phantom as well as thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs) and the active eye lens dosemeter prototype. For specific angles, the radiation bypassed the radiation safety glasses and lead glass pieces, leading to an increase in the measured $H_\text{p}(3)$. Compared to TLDs behind radiation safety glasses, measurements with the lead glass shielded prototype resulted in lower values for $H_\text{p}(3)$. Furthermore, the results did not reproduce previous findings where larger dose values were found for Dosepix behind lead glass pieces than for the TLDs behind radiation safety glasses. A possible reason might be that the dimensions of the lead glass pieces are not representative of the radiation safety glasses in front of the eye but, ultimately, it is not yet clear what the main reason for the deviation is. Therefore, it is advisable to test the same methodology in future investigations with other eyewear models and lead glass pieces to investigate whether similar behaviors occur.</description>

      <title>Ising energy model for the stochastic prediction of tumor islets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.</description>

      <title>In Vivo Wideband MR Elastography for Assessing Age-Related Viscoelastic Changes of the Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) noninvasively maps brain biomechanics and is highly sensitive to alterations associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. Most implementations use a single frequency or a narrow frequency band, limiting the analysis of frequency-dependent viscoelastic parameters.
  We developed a dual-actuator wideband MRE (5-50 Hz) protocol and acquired wavefields at 13 frequencies in 24 healthy adults (young: 23-39 years; older: 50-63 years). Shear wave speed (SWS) maps were generated as a proxy for stiffness, and SWS dispersion was modeled using Newtonian, Kelvin-Voigt, and power-law rheological models.
  Whole-brain stiffness declined with age, with the strongest effect observed at low frequencies (5-16 Hz: -0.24%/year; p=0.019) compared with mid (20-35 Hz: -0.12%/year; p=0.030) and high frequencies (40-50 Hz: -0.10%/year; p=0.165). Compared to older brains, younger adults showed 14.3% higher baseline stiffness in the power-law model (p=0.001) and 8.5-9.0% higher viscosity according to the Newtonian and Kelvin-Voigt model (p&lt;0.05). White and cortical gray matter exhibited similar age-related decreases, while deep gray matter showed an increase in the power-law exponent (+0.001/year; p=0.036), suggesting a transition toward more fluid-like properties associated with aging.
  Wideband MRE revealed frequency-dependent and region-specific biomechanical alterations with aging, with the strongest effects observed at low frequencies. Extending brain MRE into the low frequency regime potentially enhances sensitivity to solid-fluid interactions. Therefore, low frequency MRE may serve as an early biomechanical marker of microstructural brain changes due to aging and neurodegeneration.</description>
