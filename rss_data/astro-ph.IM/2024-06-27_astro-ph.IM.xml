      <title>CHARA/Silmaril Instrument Software and Data Reduction Pipeline: Characterization of the Instrument in the Lab and On-Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly installed Silmaril beam combiner at the CHARA array is designed to observe previously inaccessible faint targets, including Active Galactic Nuclei and T-Tauri Young Stellar Objects. Silmaril leverages cutting-edge optical design, low readout noise, and a high-speed C-RED1 camera to realize its sensitivity objectives. In this presentation, we offer a comprehensive overview of the instrument's software, which manages critical functions, including camera data acquisition, fringe tracking, automatic instrument alignment, and observing interfaces, all aimed at optimizing on-sky data collection. Additionally, we offer an outline of the data reduction pipeline, responsible for converting raw instrument data products into the final OIFITS used by the standard interferometry modeling software. The purpose of this paper is to provide a solid reference for studies based on Silmaril data.</description>

      <title>Realizing the potential of the Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper: Calibration methods and on-sky performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper is an innovative all-refracting telescope designed to carry out ultra-low surface brightness wide-field mapping of visible wavelength line emission. Equipped with ultranarrowband (0.8 nm bandwidth) filters mounted in Dragonfly Filter-Tilter instrumentation, the Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper maps H$\alpha$, [NII]$\lambda$6583, and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line emission produced by structures with sizes ranging from $\sim$1 to 1000 kpc in the local Universe. These spatial scales encompass that of the exceedingly diffuse and faintly radiating circumgalactic medium, which is singularly difficult to detect with conventional mirror-based telescope instrumentation. Extremely careful control of systematics is required to directly image these large scale structures, necessitating high fidelity sky background subtraction, wavelength calibration, and specialized flat-fielding methods. In this paper, we discuss the on-sky performance of the Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper with these methods in place.</description>

      <title>Searching anomalies using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. One of the events could potentially come from a white dwarf. Some of them may originate from stellar flares, lightning, or be true anomalies, which are currently of an unknown type.</description>

      <title>The power of prediction: spatiotemporal Gaussian process modeling for predictive control in slope-based wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay error is a significant error source in adaptive optics (AO) systems. It arises from the latency between sensing the wavefront and applying the correction. Predictive control algorithms reduce the time-delay error, providing significant performance gains, especially for high-contrast imaging. However, the predictive controller's performance depends on factors such as the WFS type, the measurement noise, the AO system's geometry, and the atmospheric conditions.
  This work studies the limits of prediction under different imaging conditions through spatiotemporal Gaussian process models. The method provides a predictive reconstructor that is optimal in the least-squares sense, conditioned on the fixed times series of WFS data and our knowledge of the atmosphere. We demonstrate that knowledge is power in predictive AO control. With an SHS-based extreme AO instrument, perfect knowledge of Frozen Flow evolution (wind and Cn2 profile) leads to a reduction of the residual wavefront phase variance up to a factor of 3.5 compared to a non-predictive approach. If there is uncertainty in the profile or evolution models, the gain is more modest. Still, assuming that only effective wind speed is available (without direction) led to reductions in variance by a factor of 2.3.
  We also study the value of data for predictive filters by computing the experimental utility for different scenarios to answer questions such as: How many past data frames should the prediction filter consider, and is it always most advantageous to use the most recent data? We show that within the scenarios considered, more data consistently increases prediction accuracy. Further, we demonstrate that given a computational limitation on how many past frames we can use, an optimized selection of $n$ past frames leads to a 10-15% additional improvement in RMS over using the n latest consecutive frames of data.</description>

      <title>ANDES, the high-resolution spectrograph for the ELT: RIZ Spectrograph preliminary design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here the preliminary design of the RIZ module, one of the visible spectrographs of the ANDES instrument 1. It is a fiber-fed high-resolution, high-stability spectrograph. Its design follows the guidelines of successful predecessors such as HARPS and ESPRESSO. In this paper we present the status of the spectrograph at the preliminary design stage. The spectrograph will be a warm, vacuum-operated, thermally controlled and fiber-fed echelle spectrograph. Following the phase A design, the huge etendue of the telescope will be reformed in the instrument with a long slit made of smaller fibers. We discuss the system design of the spectrographs system.</description>

      <title>RISTRETTO: Manufacturing of a single-mode visible high resolution spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectrograph of the RISTRETTO instrument is now currently being manufactured. RISTETTO is an instrument designed to detect and characterize the reflected light of nearby exoplanets. It combines high contrast imaging and high resolution spectroscopy to detect the light of exoplanets. The high resolution spectrograph subject of this paper uses the doppler effect to disentangle the planetary signal from the stellar light leaks. In this paper we describe the final design of the spectrograph and report the status of its construction. The RISTRETTO spectrograph has seven diffraction limited spaxels. The spectrograph's resolution is 130000 in the 620-840 nm band. It is designed in a similar way as HARPS and ESPRESSO, being a warm, thermally controlled spectrograph under vacuum. It is designed to be compact and self contained so that it could be installed on different telescopes. It is however tailored to be installed on a nasmyth platform of a VLT telescope. We present updates to the design and the manufacturing of the instrument. In particular we present the performance of the thermal enclosure.</description>

      <title>New high-precision measurement system for electron-positron pairs from sub-GeV/GeV gamma-rays in the emulsion telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GRAINE project observes cosmic gamma-rays, using a balloon-borne emulsion-film-based telescope in the sub-GeV/GeV energy band. We reported in our previous balloon experiment in 2018, GRAINE2018, the detection of the known brightest source, Vela pulsar, with the highest angular resolution ever reported in an energy range of $&gt;$80 MeV. However, the emulsion scanning system used in the experiment was designed to achieve a high-speed scanning, and it was not accurate enough to ensure the optimum spacial resolution of the emulsion film and limited the performance. Here, we report a new high-precision scanning system that can be used to greatly improve the observation result of GRAINE2018 and also be employed in future experiments. The system involves a new algorithm that recognizes each silver grain on an emulsion film and is capable of measuring tracks with a positional resolution for the passing points of tracks of almost the same as the intrinsic resolution of nuclear emulsion film ($\sim$70 nm). This resolution is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained with the high-speed scanning system. With this system, an angular resolution for gamma-rays of 0.1$^\circ$ at 1 GeV is expected to be achieved. Furthermore, we successfully combine the new high-precision system with the existing high-speed system, establishing the system to make a high-speed and high-precision measurement. Employing these systems, we reanalyze the gamma-ray events detected previously by only the high-speed system in GRAINE2018 and obtain an about three times higher angular resolution (0.22$^\circ$) in 500--700 MeV than the original value. The high-resolution observation may bring new insights into the gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center region and may realize polarization measurements of high-energy cosmic gamma-rays.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Reconstruction of Radio-Interferometric Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large aperture arrays, such as the currently under construction Square Kilometer Array (SKA), allows for observing the universe in the radio-spectrum at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. However, these telescopes produce data on the scale of exabytes, introducing a slew of hardware and software design challenges. This paper proposes a multi-step image reconstruction method that allows for partitioning visibility data by baseline length. This enables more flexible data distribution and parallelization, aiding in processing radio-astronomical observations within given constraints. The multi-step reconstruction is separated into two-steps, first reconstructing a low-resolution image with only short-baseline visibilities, and then using this image together with the long-baseline visibilities to reconstruct the full-resolution image. The proposed method only operates in the minor-cycle, and can be easily integrated into existing imaging pipelines. We show that our proposed method allows for partitioning visibilities by baseline without introducing significant additional drawbacks, having roughly the same computational cost and producing images of comparable quality to a method in the same framework that processes all baselines simultaneously.</description>

      <title>The Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on the Chandra X-ray Observatory: twenty-five years of on-orbit operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on the Chandra X-ray Observatory completes a quarter century of on orbit operations, it continues to perform well and produce spectacular scientific results. The response of ACIS has evolved over the lifetime of the observatory due to radiation damage, molecular contamination, changing particle environment, and aging of the spacecraft in general. We present highlights from the instrument team's monitoring program and our expectations for the future of ACIS. Performance changes on ACIS continue to be manageable, and do not indicate any limitations on ACIS lifetime. We examine aspects of the design and operation of ACIS that have impacted its long lifetime with lessons learned for future instruments.</description>

      <title>Upgrading SPHERE with the second stage AO system SAXO+: non-common path aberrations estimation and correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SAXO+ is a planned enhancement of the existing SAXO, the VLT/ SPHERE adaptive optics system, deployed on ESO's Very Large Telescope. This upgrade is designed to significantly enhance the instrument's capacity to detect and analyze young Jupiter-like planets. The pivotal addition in SAXO+ is a second-stage adaptive optics system featuring a dedicated near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor and a second deformable mirror. This secondary stage is strategically integrated to address any residual wavefront errors persisting after the initial correction performed by the current primary AO loop, SAXO. However, several recent studies clearly showed that in good conditions, even in the current system SAXO, non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) are the limiting factor of the final normalized intensity in focal plane, which is the final metric for ground-based high-contrast instruments. This is likely to be even more so the case with the new AO system, with which the AO residuals will be minimized. Several techniques have already been extensively tested on SPHERE in internal source and/or on-sky and will be presented in this paper. However, the use of a new type of sensor for the second stage, a pyramid wavefront sensor, will likely complicate the correction of these aberrations. Using an end-to-end AO simulation tool, we conducted simulations to gauge the effect of measured SPHERE NCPAs in the coronagraphic image on the second loop system and their correction using focal plane wavefront sensing systems. We finally analyzed how the chosen position of SAXO+ in the beam will impact the evolution of the NCPAs in the new instrument.</description>

      <title>Image-based wavefront correction using model-free Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical aberrations prevent telescopes from reaching their theoretical diffraction limit. Once estimated, these aberrations can be compensated for using deformable mirrors in a closed loop. Focal plane wavefront sensing enables the estimation of the aberrations on the complete optical path, directly from the images taken by the scientific sensor. However, current focal plane wavefront sensing methods rely on physical models whose inaccuracies may limit the overall performance of the correction. The aim of this study is to develop a data-driven method using model-free reinforcement learning to automatically perform the estimation and correction of the aberrations, using only phase diversity images acquired around the focal plane as inputs. We formulate the correction problem within the framework of reinforcement learning and train an agent on simulated data. We show that the method is able to reliably learn an efficient control strategy for various realistic conditions. Our method also demonstrates robustness to a wide range of noise levels.</description>

      <title>Galaxy spectroscopy without spectra: Galaxy properties from photometric images with conditional diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys can only target a small fraction of the vast amount of photometrically cataloged sources in wide-field surveys. Here, we report the development of a generative AI method capable of predicting optical galaxy spectra from photometric broad-band images alone. This method draws from the latest advances in diffusion models in combination with contrastive networks. We pass multi-band galaxy images into the architecture to obtain optical spectra. From these, robust values for galaxy properties can be derived with any methods in the spectroscopic toolbox, such as standard population synthesis techniques and Lick indices. When trained and tested on 64x64-pixel images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the global bimodality of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in photometric space is recovered, as well as a mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. The comparison between the observed and the artificially created spectra shows good agreement in overall metallicity, age, Dn4000, stellar velocity dispersion, and E(B-V) values. Photometric redshift estimates of our generative algorithm can compete with other current, specialized deep-learning techniques. Moreover, this work is the first attempt in the literature to infer velocity dispersion from photometric images. Additionally, we can predict the presence of an active galactic nucleus up to an accuracy of 82%. With our method, scientifically interesting galaxy properties, normally requiring spectroscopic inputs, can be obtained in future data sets from large-scale photometric surveys alone. The spectra prediction via AI can further assist in creating realistic mock catalogs.</description>

      <title>Detection, sky localization and early warning for binary neutron star mergers by detectors located in China of different configurations in third generation detector network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows the results of an evaluation of the impact that a detector located in China, with a noise budget comparable to that of a proposed high-frequency detector with a 20 km arm length, an Einstein Telescope (ET) or a Cosmic Explorer (CE), could have on the network of ET-CE in terms of detection rate, localization, and providing early warning alert for simulated binary neutron star (BNS)s. The results indicate that a three-detector network including a Chinese detector could identify at least 4.4% more BNS mergers than an ET-CE network alone. The localization uncertainty could be reduced by a factor of more than 5 on average compared to the ET-CE network. With a three-detector network involving a Chinese detector, up to 89% of BNS mergers could be located within 10 square degrees of the sky 10 minutes prior to the merger. The assessment suggests that the potential for early warning signals is highest when the Chinese detector is similar to ET, whereas the sources are detected with the highest signal-to-noise ratio and localized to the smallest regions when the detector is more akin to CE. Interestingly, the C20N network (comprising ET+CE+C20) can achieve comparable localization performance as the ET network while outperforming the ETCN network (featuring the ET+CE+ an ET-like detector in China) in terms of detection capabilities, especially at large distances, indicating that adding a 20 km kilohertz detector in China to ET-CE network would make significant contributions at least as adding an ET-like detector in China to multi-messenger astronomy for almost all BNS observations.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Stellar Spectral Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of which is usually costly in both time and expertise. This paper explores the application of active learning algorithms to sampling stellar spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter catalogue. Using different active learning algorithms, we iteratively select informative instances, where the model or committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement, respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve, in addition to the Matthew\'s correlation coefficient, which offers a more-balanced assessment that considers all aspects of the confusion matrix, and is thus more suitable for use with imbalanced datasets. We apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics superior to random sampling and even stratified samples. We discuss the implications of the findings for prioritizing instance labelling of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high time cost.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and characterizing very low-energy ($\sim$eV) background sources is a must in rare-event searches. Oscura, an experiment aiming to probe electron recoils from sub-GeV dark matter using a 10-kg skipper-CCD detector, has recently fabricated its first two batches of sensors. In this work, we present the characterization of defects/contaminants identified in the buried-channel region of these newly fabricated skipper-CCDs. These defects/contaminants produce deferred charge from trap emission in the images next to particle tracks, which can be spatially resolved due to the sub-electron resolution achieved with these sensors. Using the trap-pumping technique, we measured the energy and cross section associated to these traps in three Oscura prototype sensors from different fabrication batches which underwent different gettering methods during fabrication. Results suggest that the type of defects/contaminants is more closely linked to the fabrication batch rather than to the gettering method used. The exposure-dependent single-electron rate (SER) of one of these sensors was measured $\sim$100~m underground, yielding $(1.8\pm 0.3)\times10^{-3}~e^-$/pix/day at 131K. The impact of the identified traps on the measured exposure-dependent SER is evaluated via a Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that the exposure-dependent SER of Oscura prototype sensors would be lower in lower background environments as expected.</description>

      <title>Template bank to search for exotic gravitational wave signals from astrophysical compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03274</link>

Abstract: Modeled searches of gravitational wave signals from compact binary mergers rely on template waveforms determined by the theory of general relativity (GR). Once a signal is detected, one generally performs the model agnostic test of GR, either looking for consistency between the GR waveform and data or introducing phenomenological deviations to detect the departure from GR. The non-trivial presence of beyond-GR physics can alter the waveform and could be missed by the GR template-based searches. A recent study [Phys. Rev. D 107, 024017 (2023)] targeted the binary black hole merger, assuming the parametrized deviation in lower post-Newtonian terms and demonstrated a mild effect on the search sensitivity. Surprisingly, for the search space of binary neutron star (BNS) systems where component masses range from 1 to $2.4\:\rm{M}_\odot$ and parametrized deviations span $1\sigma$ width of the deviation parameters measured from the GW170817 event, the GR template bank is highly ineffectual for detecting the non-GR signals. Here, we present a new hybrid method to construct a non-GR template bank for the BNS search space. The hybrid method uses the geometric approach of three-dimensional lattice placement to cover most of the parameter space volume, followed by the random method to cover the boundary regions of parameter space. We find that the non-GR bank size is $\sim$15 times larger than the conventional GR bank and is effectual towards detecting non-GR signals in the target search space.</description>

      <title>Glitch veto based on unphysical gravitational wave binary inspiral templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient signals arising from instrumental or environmental factors, commonly referred to as glitches, constitute the predominant background of false alarms in gravitational wave searches with ground-based detectors. Therefore, effective data analysis methods for vetoing glitch-induced false alarms are crucial to enhancing the sensitivity of a search. We present a veto method for glitches that impact matched filtering-based searches for binary inspiral signals. The veto uses unphysical sectors in the space of chirp time parameters as well as an unphysical extension including negative chirp times to efficiently segregate glitches from gravitational wave signals in data from a single detector. Inhabited predominantly by glitches but nearly depopulated of genuine gravitational wave signals, these unphysical sectors can be efficiently explored using Particle Swarm Optimization. In a test carried out on data taken from both LIGO detectors spanning multiple observation runs, the veto was able to reject $99.9\%$ of glitches with no loss of signals detected with signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 9.0$ and total detector frame mass $\leq 80$ $M_\odot$. Our results show that extending a matched filter search to unphysical parts of a signal parameter space promises to be an effective strategy for mitigating glitches.</description>
