      <title>Performance Characterization of Heliotrope Solar Hot-Air Balloons during Multihour Stratospheric Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heliotropes are passive solar hot air balloons that are capable of achieving nearly level flight within the lower stratosphere for several hours. These inexpensive flight platforms enable stratospheric sensing with high-cadence enabled by the low cost to manufacture, but their performance has not yet been assessed systematically. During July to September of 2021, 29 heliotropes were successfully launched from Oklahoma and achieved float altitude as part of the Balloon-based Acoustic Seismology Study (BASS). All of the heliotrope envelopes were nearly identical with only minor variations to the flight line throughout the campaign. Flight data collected during this campaign comprise a large sample to characterize the typical heliotrope flight behavior during launch, ascent, float, and descent. Each flight stage is characterized, dependence on various parameters is quantified, and a discussion of nominal and anomalous flights is provided.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Solar Driver Forecasting with Multivariate Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a comprehensive framework for F10.7, S10.7, M10.7, and Y10.7 solar driver forecasting with a time series Transformer (PatchTST). To ensure an equal representation of high and low levels of solar activity, we construct a custom loss function to weight samples based on the distance between the solar driver's historical distribution and the training set. The solar driver forecasting framework includes an 18-day lookback window and forecasts 6 days into the future. When benchmarked against the Space Environment Technologies (SET) dataset, our model consistently produces forecasts with a lower standard mean error in nearly all cases, with improved prediction accuracy during periods of high solar activity. All the code is available on Github https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/sw-driver-forecaster.</description>

      <title>Influence of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejec5ons on Terrestrial Par5cle Fluxes Through Magnetosphere Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the modulation of particle fluxes at the Earths surface influenced by the intensity and orientation of the Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the Coronal Mass Ejecta (ICME). We examine how IMF and its Bz component, opposing the magnetosphere, significantly enhance geomagnetic activity through magnetic reconnection. This reconnection facilitates increased penetration of solar wind particles into the magnetosphere, thus amplifying the fluxes registered by terrestrial particle detectors and enhancing particle fluxes through reduced cutoff rigidity (magnetospheric effect, ME). Conversely, the orientation of the Bz component is less crucial for a Forbush decrease (FD); instead, the strength of the ejecta's scalar magnetic field (B) predominates, potentially triggering a significant FD. The study explores how magnetic field variations influence the flux of neutrons and muons, effectively modifying the observed rates of cosmic ray influx. Comprehensive data from the WIND magnetometer and Aragats spectrometers underline the direct relationship between ICME magnetic configurations and variations in ground-level particle fluxes. Moreover, we discover that the energy spectra of additional particles during ME are limited to 10 MeV due to the low energy of solar protons entering the terrestrial atmosphere. In contrast, the energy spectra of the missing FD particles can extend up to 100 MeV, demonstrating that magnetic traps and cradles formed by interactions between ejecta and Earth's magnetic fields can also deflect medium-energy solar protons. These insights advance our understanding of geomagnetic modulation of particle fluxes and bolster predictive models of space weather impacts on particle detection technologies.</description>

      <title>Rocket Exhaust Blowing Soil in Near Vacuum Conditions is Faster than Predicted by Continuum Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments were performed to study how rocket exhaust blows soil in lunar and Martian conditions. Jets of gas were blown downwardly at various granular materials while a camera recorded the formation of scour holes as the material was removed. The experiments were performed in a series of conditions ranging from ambient 101 kPa pressure down to 0.3 kPa. This includes the range that is relevant for lunar conditions, because it is not hard vacuum inside the rocket exhaust where soil is being eroded. Prior work in ambient conditions showed that erosion rate is proportional to the square of the densimetric Froude number. However, the prior work was not performed at low pressures. In the new work, preliminary results show that as the gas density is so low that gas flow around the sand grains is no longer in the continuum regime, then erosion rate is faster than predicted by the earlier results. The dependency of erosion rate on various parameters is determined, but it turns out to be more complex than expected so additional experimental work will be required to develop complete scaling relationships.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic medium rotation measure of primordial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the Rotation Measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe - tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic Medium (IGM; referred to as $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled to the light cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths $\lesssim 0.75$ nanoGauss, if originated during inflation with the scale invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length $\sim 19$ cMpc/h or $ \lesssim 30$ nanoGauss if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length $\sim 1$ cMpc/h. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as an Extrasolar Planet Discovery and Characterization: Interior Structure and Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of radio emission from Jupiter was identified quickly as being due to its planetary-scale magnetic field. Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had large-scale magnetic fields. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the their magnetic fields are generated by dynamo processes within these planets, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. In the case of Jupiter, its magnetic field interacts with the moon Io to result in radio emission as well.
  Extrasolar planets reasonably may be expected to generate large-scale magnetic fields and to sustain an electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may these radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. Since the first edition of the Handbook, there have been a number of advances, albeit there remain no unambigous detection of radio emission from extrasolar planets. New ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the future.</description>
