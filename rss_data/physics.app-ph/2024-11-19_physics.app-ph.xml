      <title>Selective Spin Wave Non-reciprocity in Engineered Chiral Magnonic Crystal without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is pivotal in magnonics, particularly for achieving spin wave non-reciprocity which is critical in advancing spin wave based communication and logic operations. In general, chirality in magnetic systems is realized through the interfacial antisymmetric exchange interaction, namely, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI), which is an intrinsic phenomenon occurring at the buried interface of ferromagnet and heavy metal. In this work, using micromagnetic simulations, we present a new route to achieve spin wave nonreciprocity using an engineered chiral magnonic crystal, where we artificially created in-plane twisted spin textures by imposing certain handedness in the structural geometry. The manipulation of the relative arrangement of these chiral enantiomers led to spin wave non-reciprocity, which could be tuned by selecting different channels within the crystal, with additional versatility in the resonant mode frequency. Further adjustment of the external magnetic field strength confirms that the spin wave directionality originates from the spin texture. This enables additional control over the band gap and mode propagation characteristics by external field tuning. Our work provides a novel and innovative route to simultaneously access opposite spin wave directions in consecutive channels, which makes this system competent for real on-chip magnonic diode, with predefined paths for counter-propagating information.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effects of diameter and volume fraction of quantum dots on photocarrier generation rate in solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends a previous model for p-i-n GaAs quantum dot solar cells (QDSC) by revising the equation of photocarrier generation rate in quantum dots (QDs) inside the intrinsic region. In our model, we address a notable discrepancy that arose from the previous model where they did not consider the volume of QDs within the intrinsic region, leading to an overestimation of the photocarrier generation rate. Our present model rectifies this by incorporating the volume of quantum dots, resulting in adjustments to the photocarrier generation rate. Additionally, we determine the absorption coefficient of the QDs based on Mie theory for different diameter sizes considering the constant volume fraction of the total number of QDs in the intrinsic region. We observe in our analysis that the absorption spectra of the QDs and host material may overlap in certain cases, although the previous model assumed no overlap. This finding suggests the need for caution when evaluating spectral overlap: if the spectra do not overlap, both the previous and current modified models can be reliably applied. However, in cases of overlap, careful consideration is required to ensure accurate predictions of photocarrier generation. Furthermore, investigating the effect of QD diameter size on the photocarrier generation rate in the intrinsic region, we find that smaller QD sizes result in a higher absorption coefficient as well as a higher generation rate for a constant volume of QDs in the region. Moreover, we establish the optimization of the QDs array size by varying the size and the total volume of QDs to improve the generation rate. Our analysis reveals that a higher volume of QDs and a smaller size of QDs result in the maximum generation rate. From an experimental perspective, we propose that the optimal arrangement of QDs in such solar cells is a 0.5 volume fraction with a QD diameter of 2 nm.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Study on Heat Transfer Characteristics of Water Heat Pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat pipe is an efficient heat transfer element based on two-phase natural circulation, which has advantages of simple structure, strong heat transfer ability, and good isothermal performance. Heat pipes are widely used in heat transfer and other fields, and especially have important applications in nuclear engineering. One of its most important characteristics is the heat transfer limit. In this work, heat transfer limits are first reviewed, and the detailed calculation equations are presented. Then, a Matlab code to calculate heat transfer limits as well as the thermal conductance are provided. Second, an experimental setup for testing the heat transfer characteristics of heat pipes was developed, which could be used to measure the thermal conductance as well as the heat transfer limits. The calculated results show that, for water heat pipes, the capillary limit mainly affects heat transfer in low temperature conditions, while in high temperature conditions, boiling limit dominates. In addition, the experiment results show that the thermal conductance of the measured heat pipe is 7267 W/(m^2*K), which agrees with the calculation result.</description>

      <title>Optimal structured light waves generation in 3D volumes using communication mode optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of light intensity in 3D volumes is highly in demand in many applications in optics. Various wavefront shaping techniques have been utilized to reconstruct a target amplitude profile within a 3D space. However, these techniques are intrinsically limited by cross-talk and often rely on optimization methods to improve the reconstruction quality. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a new wavefront shaping method based on interfering the optimum orthogonal communication modes connecting a source plane and a receiving volume. These optimum modes are computed from the singular value decomposition of a coupling operator that connects each point at the source plane to another one in the receiving volume. The modes comprise a pair of source and receiving eigenfunctions, each one forming a complete orthogonal basis for their respective spaces. We utilize these modes to construct arbitrarily chosen 2D and 3D structured light waves within the output receiving volume and optically generate these waves using a spatial light modulator. Our generated intensity profiles exhibit low cross-talk, high fidelity, and high contrast. We envision our work to inspire new directions in any domain that requires controlling light intensity in 3D with high precision such as in holography, microscopy, metrology, light-matter interactions, and optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Twisted Type-II Rashba Homobilayer: A Platform for Tunable Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of topological flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and multilayer graphene has sparked significant research interest. We propose a new platform for realizing tunable topological moire flat bands: twisted type-II Rashba homobilayers. The interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions generates an effective pseudo-antiferromagnetic field, opening a gap within the Dirac cone with non-zero Berry curvature. Using twisted BiTeI bilayers as an example, we predict the emergence of flat topological bands with a remarkably narrow bandwidth (below 20 meV). Notably, the system undergoes a transition from a valley Hall insulator to a quantum spin Hall insulator as the twisting angle increases. This transition arises from a competition between the twisting-driven effective spin-orbit coupling and sublattice onsite energies presented in type-II Rashba moir\'e structures. The high tunability of Rashba materials in terms of the spin-orbit coupling strength, interlayer interaction, and twisting angle expands the range of materials suitable for realizing and manipulating correlated topological properties.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Metamaterial Stiffness Beyond Hashin-Shtrikman Upper Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its introduction more than 60 years ago, the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound has stood as the theoretical limit for the stiffness of isotropic composites and porous solids, acting as an important reference against which the moduli of heterogeneous structural materials are assessed. Here, we show through first-principles calculations, supported by finite element simulations, that the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound can be exceeded by the isotropic elastic response of an anisotropic structure constructed from an anisotropic material. The material and structural anisotropies mutually reinforce each other to realize the overall isotropic response, without incurring the mass penalty faced by the hybridization of geometries with complementary anisotropies. 3 designs were investigated (plate BCC, plate FCC and plate SC) but only plate SC yielded a solution for the anisotropic properties of the material, which are remarkably similar to that of single crystal nickel and single crystal ferrite.</description>

      <title>Intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on vortex pinning and Jc degradation in polycrystalline superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.</description>

      <title>Tunable Sub-THz and THz lasing effect using FETs at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I report on the first observed self-amplification by stimulated emission of 0.2THz and 1.63THz radiation using InGaAs/GaAs HEMT operating in the deep saturation regime at room temperature. I demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the Sub-THz and THz FETs response is due to rectification of the nonlinear dependence of the device current-voltage characteristics. FETs do operate as a nonlinear THz mixers and rectifiers and its open-drain responsivity is given by a similar expression to that of zero-bias Schottky diode detector. However, operating FETs deep in the saturation regime does allow the accurate tuning of the device to the resonance condition or the negative resistance mode at room temperature, hence FETs can be tuned in the deep saturation regime to enable sub-THz and THz lasing effect. This observed sub-THz and THz laser phenomena using FETs will revolutionize human technology in all fields of life in the near future.</description>

      <title>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. Although, understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the observed softening is still an open question, present analysis strongly suggest sub-ppb level of neutral single-atomic vacancies or other unspecified non-magnetic vacancy concentrations in all investigated diamonds. Our findings also open new avenues for the quantitative determination of non-magnetic vacancies in diamonds, an important information needed for their potential application as a substrate for quantum computers and next-generation semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>PZT Optical Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of new applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation efficiency. For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>
