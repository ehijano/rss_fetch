      <title>Algebraic Proof Theory for Infinitary Action Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a uniform method for obtaining (wellfounded and non-wellfounded) cut-free sequent-style proof systems that are sound and complete for various classes of action algebras, i.e., Kleene algebras enriched with meets and residuals. Our method applies to any class of *-continuous action algebras that is defined, relative to the class of all *-continuous action algebras, by analytic quasiequations. The latter make up an expansive class of conditions encompassing the algebraic analogues of most well-known structural rules. These results are achieved by wedding existing work on non-wellfounded proof theory for action algebras with tools from algebraic proof theory.</description>

      <title>Induction and Recursion Principles in a Higher-Order Quantitative Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative logic reasons about the degree to which formulas are satisfied. This paper studies the fundamental reasoning principles of higher-order quantitative logic and their application to reasoning about probabilistic programs and processes.
  We construct an affine calculus for 1-bounded complete metric spaces and the monad for probability measures equipped with the Kantorovic distance. The calculus includes a form of guarded recursion interpreted via Banach's fixed point theorem, useful, e.g., for recursive programming with processes. We then define an affine higher-order quantitative logic for reasoning about terms of our calculus. The logic includes novel principles for guarded recursion, and induction over probability measures and natural numbers.
  Examples of reasoning in the logic include proofs of upper bounds on distances of processes. We also show how our logic can express coupling proofs - a powerful technique for comparing probabilistic processes.</description>

      <title>Knowledge in multi-robot systems: an interplay of dynamics, computation and communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the hybrid systems perspective of distributed multi-robot systems is compatible with logical models of knowledge already used in distributed computing, and demonstrate its usefulness by deriving sufficient epistemic conditions for exploration and gathering robot tasks to be solvable. We provide a separation of the physical and computational aspects of a robotic system, allowing us to decouple the problems related to each and directly use methods from control theory and distributed computing, fields that are traditionally distant in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate a novel approach for reasoning about the knowledge in multi-robot systems through a principled method of converting a switched hybrid dynamical system into a temporal-epistemic logic model, passing through an abstract state machine representation. This creates space for methods and results to be exchanged across the fields of control theory, distributed computing and temporal-epistemic logic, while reasoning about multi-robot systems.</description>

      <title>Transductions of Graph Classes Admitting Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a quest to thoroughly understand the first-order transduction hierarchy of hereditary graph classes, some questions in particular stand out; such as, what properties hold for graph classes that are first-order transductions of planar graphs (and of similar classes)? When addressing this (so-far wide open) question, we turn to the concept of a product structure - being a subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of bounded tree-width, introduced by Dujmovic et al. [JACM 2020]. Namely, we prove that any graph class which is a first-order transduction of a class admitting such product structure, up to perturbations also meets a structural description generalizing the concept of a product structure in a dense hereditary way - the latter concept being introduced just recently by Hlineny and Jedelsky under the name of H-clique-width [MFCS 2024]. Using this characterization, we show that the class of the 3D grids, as well as a class of certain modifications of 2D grids, are not first-order transducible from classes admitting a product structure, and in particular not from the class of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Universal Safety Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of logical controller synthesis is to automatically compute a control strategy that regulates the discrete, event-driven behavior of a given plant s.t. a temporal logic specification holds over all remaining traces. Standard approaches to this problem construct a two-player game by composing a given complete plant model and the logical specification and applying standard algorithmic techniques to extract a control strategy. However, due to the often enormous state space of a complete plant model, this process can become computationally infeasible. In this paper, we introduce a novel synthesis approach that constructs a universal controller derived solely from the game obtained by the standard translation of the logical specification. The universal controller's moves are annotated with prophecies - predictions about the plant's behavior that ensure the move is safe. By evaluating these prophecies, the universal controller can be adapted to any plant over which the synthesis problem is realizable. This approach offers several key benefits, including enhanced scalability with respect to the plant's size, adaptability to changes in the plant, and improved explainability of the resulting control strategy. We also present encouraging experimental results obtained with our prototype tool, UNICON.</description>

      <title>The Algebra of Parity Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Watanabe, Eberhart, Asada, and Hasuo have shown that parity games can be seen as string diagrams, that is, as the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category, an algebraic structure with two different operations of composition. Furthermore, they have shown that the winning regions associated to a given game can be computed functorially, i.e. compositionally. Building on their results, this paper focuses on the equational properties of parity games, giving them a sound and complete axiomatisation. The payoff is that any parity game can be solved using equational reasoning directly at the level of the string diagram that represents it. Finally, we translate the diagrammatic language of parity games to an equally expressive symbolic calculus with fixpoints, and equip it with its own equational theory.</description>

      <title>Stream-Based Monitoring of Algorithmic Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic decision and prediction systems are increasingly deployed in applications where they significantly impact the livelihood of people, such as for predicting the creditworthiness of loan applicants or the recidivism risk of defendants. These applications have given rise to a new class of algorithmic-fairness specifications that require the systems to decide and predict without bias against social groups. Verifying these specifications statically is often out of reach for realistic systems, since the systems may, e.g., employ complex learning components, and reason over a large input space. In this paper, we therefore propose stream-based monitoring as a solution for verifying the algorithmic fairness of decision and prediction systems at runtime. Concretely, we present a principled way to formalize algorithmic fairness over temporal data streams in the specification language RTLola and demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on a number of benchmarks. Besides synthetic scenarios that particularly highlight its efficiency on streams with a scaling amount of data, we notably evaluate the monitor on real-world data from the recidivism prediction tool COMPAS.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a graphical syntax based on string diagrams for graded symmetric monoidal categories along with a sound and complete axiomatic system to reason about graded monoidal terms. We also provide one abstract example of presentation for the Para construction on monoidal actegories, and we instantiate it to axiomatize a variant of the graded category $\ImP$, which was recently introduced by Liell-Cock and Staton to model imprecise probability.</description>

      <title>Rewriting for Symmetric Monoidal Categories with Commutative (Co)Monoid Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String diagrams are pictorial representations for morphisms of symmetric monoidal categories. They constitute an intuitive and expressive graphical syntax, which has found application in a very diverse range of fields including concurrency theory, quantum computing, control theory, machine learning, linguistics, and digital circuits. Rewriting theory for string diagrams relies on a combinatorial interpretation as double-pushout rewriting of certain hypergraphs. As previously studied, there is a `tension' in this interpretation: in order to make it sound and complete, we either need to add structure on string diagrams (in particular, Frobenius algebra structure) or pose restrictions on double-pushout rewriting (resulting in 'convex' rewriting). From the string diagram viewpoint, imposing a full Frobenius structure may not always be natural or desirable in applications, which motivates our study of a weaker requirement: commutative monoid structure. In this work we characterise string diagram rewriting modulo commutative monoid equations, via a sound and complete interpretation in a suitable notion of double-pushout rewriting of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of Quantified Boolean Announcements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic epistemic logics consider formal representations of agents' knowledge, and how the knowledge of agents changes in response to informative events, such as public announcements. Quantifying over informative events allows us to ask whether it is possible to achieve some state of knowledge, and has important applications in synthesising secure communication protocols. However, quantifying over quite simple informative events, public announcements, is not computable: such an arbitrary public announcement logic, APAL, has an undecidable satisfiability problem. Here we consider even simpler informative events called Boolean announcements, where announcements are restricted to be a Boolean combination of atomic propositions. The logic is called Boolean arbitrary public announcement logic, BAPAL. A companion paper provides a complete finitary axiomatization, and related expressivity results, for BAPAL. In this work the satisfiability problem for BAPAL is shown to decidable, and also that BAPAL does not have the finite model property.</description>

      <title>A Curry-Howard Correspondence for Linear, Reversible Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11887v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a linear and reversible programming language with inductives types and recursion. The semantics of the languages is based on pattern-matching; we show how ensuring syntactical exhaustivity and non-overlapping of clauses is enough to ensure reversibility. The language allows to represent any Primitive Recursive Function. We then give a Curry-Howard correspondence with the logic $\mu$MALL: linear logic extended with least fixed points allowing inductive statements. The critical part of our work is to show how primitive recursion yields circular proofs that satisfy $\mu$MALL validity criterion and how the language simulates the cut-elimination procedure of $\mu$MALL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results concerning the expressiveness and decidability of a popular graph learning formalism, graph neural networks (GNNs), exploiting connections with logic. We use a family of recently-discovered decidable logics involving "Presburger quantifiers". We show how to use these logics to measure the expressiveness of classes of GNNs, in some cases getting exact correspondences between the expressiveness of logics and GNNs. We also employ the logics, and the techniques used to analyze them, to obtain decision procedures for verification problems over GNNs. We complement this with undecidability results for static analysis problems involving the logics, as well as for GNN verification problems.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Nondeterminism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09866v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study three levels in a hierarchy of nondeterminism: A nondeterministic automaton $\mathcal{A}$ is determinizable by pruning (DBP) if we can obtain a deterministic automaton equivalent to $\mathcal{A}$ by removing some of its transitions. Then, $\mathcal{A}$ is history deterministic (HD) if its nondeterministic choices can be resolved in a way that only depends on the past. Finally, $\mathcal{A}$ is semantically deterministic (SD) if different nondeterministic choices in $\mathcal{A}$ lead to equivalent states. Some applications of automata in formal methods require deterministic automata, yet in fact can use automata with some level of nondeterminism. For example, DBP automata are useful in the analysis of online algorithms, and HD automata are useful in synthesis and control. For automata on finite words, the three levels in the hierarchy coincide. We study the hierarchy for B\"uchi, co-B\"uchi, and weak automata on infinite words. We show that the hierarchy is strict, study the expressive power of the different levels in it, as well as the complexity of deciding the membership of a language in a given level. Finally, we describe a probability-based analysis of the hierarchy, which relates the level of nondeterminism with the probability that a random run on a word in the language is accepting. We relate the latter to nondeterministic automata that can be used when reasoning about probabilistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a proof-theoretic approach to showing nondefinability of second-order intuitionistic connectives by quantifier-free schemata. We apply the method to prove that Taranovsky's "realizability disjunction" connective does not admit a quantifier-free definition, and use it to obtain new results and more nuanced information about the nondefinability of Kreisel's and Po{\l}acik's unary connectives. The finitary and combinatorial nature of our method makes it resilient to changes in metatheory, and suitable even for settings with axioms that are explicitly incompatible with classical logic. Furthermore, the problem-specific subproofs arising from this approach can be readily transcribed into univalent type theory and verified using the Agda proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17023v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a survey of the two-dimensional and tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory, i.e. in the theory of directed-complete partial orders (dcpos) over an arbitrary elementary topos. We establish the universal property of lifting of dcpos as the Sierpi\'nski cone, from which we deduce (1) that lifting forms a Kock-Z\"oberlein doctrine, (2) that lifting algebras, pointed dcpos, and inductive partial orders form canonically equivalent locally posetal 2-categories, and (3) that the category of lifting algebras is cocomplete, with connected colimits created by the forgetful functor to dcpos. Finally we deduce the symmetric monoidal closure of the Eilenberg-Moore resolution of the lifting 2-monad by means of smash products; these are shown to classify both bilinear maps and strict maps, which we prove to coincide in the constructive setting. We provide several concrete computations of the smash product as dcpo coequalisers and lifting algebra coequalisers, and compare these with the more abstract results of Seal. Although all these results are well-known classically, the existing proofs do not apply in a constructive setting; indeed, the classical analysis of the Eilenberg-Moore category of the lifting monad relies on the fact that all lifting algebras are free, a condition that is not known to hold constructively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network verification is a new and rapidly developing field of research. So far, the main priority has been establishing efficient verification algorithms and tools, while proper support from the programming language perspective has been considered secondary or unimportant. Yet, there is mounting evidence that insights from the programming language community may make a difference in the future development of this domain.
