      <title>SHARAD Illuminates Deeper Martian Subsurface Structures with a Boost from Very Large Rolls of the MRO Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21810v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout its mission, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has often rolled about its along-track axis by up to 28{\deg} to partially compensate for the suboptimal location of the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) antenna along an edge of the spacecraft that is opposite the imaging payload deck, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of echoes returned from the surface. After recent modeling work predicted that a much larger roll would improve the S/N by ~10 dB relative to nadir-pointed observing, MRO began a limited series of 120{\deg} roll maneuvers to test the effects on radar sounding. Three such SHARAD very-large-roll (VLR) observations have been acquired since May 2023, and they show dramatic improvements in signal clarity and depth of penetration, with S/N increasing by 9, 11, and 14 dB over that of nearly coincident observations at 0{\deg} roll angle. In low dielectric terrains, the first and second VLR observations enabled basal detections at depths previously unachievable, reaching depths of 800 m in Medusae Fossae materials and 1500 m through the ice of Ultimi Scopuli, respectively. The second VLR observation also obtained enhanced reflections throughout the ice stack. In the higher dielectric terrain of Amazonis Planitia, the third VLR observation improved continuity of a dipping subsurface interface, but it revealed neither an extension of the interface to greater depths nor any deeper interfaces. The MRO mission intends to obtain more SHARAD VLR observations of polar terrains and of midlatitude glacial and ground ices, sediments, and volcanics.</description>

      <title>Determination of Light Curve Parameters of Poorly Studied Eclipsing Variables Using Data from Tess and Other Sky Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A group of poorly studied eclipsing variables (the classification of which is marked as uncertain and/or the period of brightness changes is uncertain) has been studied with the using of the photometric observations of the TESS mission and NSVS, ASAS-SN sky surveys. We also obtained some observations covering the brightness minima of our variables by our group using the telescopes at Astronomical Observatory on Kolonica Saddle (Slovakia) and Observatory and Planetarium in Hlohovec (Slovakia) during the "Variable-2024" astrocamp. The periods and classification were corrected. For NSV 575 and NSV 014 the periods were found for the first time, but it is doubtful that NSV 014 is an eclipsing variable, because there are no eclipses but the asymmetric wave is present, which indicates that the variable star can be re-classified as a low-amplitude pulsating one. Different methods were used for approximation of the light curves and further calculation of stellar system's parameters such as eclipse depths and durations, values of reflection effect and effect of ellipticity of stars. The initial period was estimated using the periodogram based on the trigonometrical polynomial fit of high order (up to 10). For better approximation of the complete eclipsing phase curve, the "New Algol Variable" (NAV) software was used. The methods of "asymptotic parabolas" and "wall-supported asymptotic parabolas" were used for calculation of moments of eclipses, which use only near-eclipse part of the observations instead of a complete curve. These methods were implemented in the software MAVKA among a larger set of features. For the variables NSV 489 and NSV 1884, our moments of eclipses and the ones found in the literature, were used for the O-C curves. For NSV 489, the period was adjusted taking into account the slope of the O-C diagram.</description>

      <title>Hidden Transits: TOI-2285 b is a Warmer sub-Neptune Likely with a Super-Earth Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TOI-2285 b is a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting a nearby M dwarf, discovered through the TESS photometric survey and ground-based follow-up observations. The planet was initially reported to have an orbital period of 27.27 d, making it one of the lowest temperature sub-Neptunes transiting a bright M dwarf. However, additional TESS data reveal that its true orbital period is 13.64 d, half the original value, resulting in a warmer equilibrium temperature (358 K) than previously estimated (284 K). The misidentification likely resulted from the low signal-to-noise ratio of individual transit signals and the limited number of transits observed by TESS at that time. This case highlights the importance of carefully considering harmonic solutions for similar cases. The additional TESS data also reveal another planetary candidate with an orbital period of 9.67 d and a radius of 1.5 $R_\oplus$, requiring validation in future studies.</description>

      <title>Hot Rocks Survey III: A deep eclipse for LHS 1140c and a new Gaussian process method to account for correlated noise in individual pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths is becoming a common technique to search for atmospheres around rocky exoplanets. This method constrains the brightness temperature of the planet to determine whether heat redistribution is taking place - indicative of an atmosphere - or whether the heat is reradiated from a low albedo bare rock. By observing at 15$\mu$m we are also highly sensitive to CO$_2$ absorption. We observed three eclipses of the rocky super-Earth LHS 1140c using MIRI/Imaging with the F1500W filter. We found significant variation in the initial settling ramp for these observations and identify a potential trend between detector settling and the previous filter used by MIRI. We analysed our data using aperture photometry but also developed a novel approach which joint-fits pixel light curves directly using a shared eclipse model and a flexible multi-dimensional Gaussian process which models changes in the PSF over time. We demonstrate using simulated data that our method has the ability to weight away from particular pixels which show increased systematics, allowing for the recovery of eclipse depths in a more robust and precise way. Both methods and an independent analysis detect the eclipse at $&gt;5\sigma$ and are highly consistent with a low albedo bare rock. We recover a dayside brightness temperature of $T_\mathrm{day} = 561\pm44$ K, close to the theoretical maximum of $T_\text{day; max} = 537\pm9$ K. We rule out a wide range of atmospheric forward models to $&gt;3\sigma$ including pure CO$_2$ atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge10$ mbar and pure H$_2$O atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge1$ bar. Our strict constraints on potential atmospheric composition, in combination with future observations of the exciting outer planet LHS 1140b, could provide a powerful benchmark to understand atmospheric escape around M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and host stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complete, accurate, and precise catalogues of exoplanet host star (EHS) properties are essential to deriving high-quality exoplanet parameters. This paper aims at homogeneously parameterising EHS and their exoplanets, using Gaia and GSP-spec data. For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no prior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions, kinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556 exoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff, L*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more precise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty; this reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer analysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation valley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS population is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties, although they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral arm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo members have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp increases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy between dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more massive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets are more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies that the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus, with dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]&gt;~1.5 times Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and precise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.</description>

      <title>Complete Catalog of Laser Locking Configurations for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will enable direct observations of low-frequency gravitational waves, offering unprecedented insight into astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. LISA's heterodyne interferometric measurement system requires phase-locking five of its six onboard lasers with tunable frequency offsets to ensure that all beatnotes remain within the metrology system's operational range, despite Doppler-induced frequency shifts. The selection of these offset frequencies -- collectively forming a frequency plan -- is a complex optimization problem constrained by the spacecraft's orbital dynamics and instrument limitations. While previous work established an algorithmic solution for deriving time-dependent frequency plans, this study takes a complementary approach by systematically analyzing and cataloging all possible laser locking configurations. We present an automated method to explore, validate, and classify viable locking schemes, identifying 36 unique non-frequency-swapping configurations and 72 additional frequency-swapping configurations for an arbitrary choice of primary laser. This exhaustive classification provides a foundation for frequency planning across the full range of operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Optical Design of the Carbon Investigation(Carbon-I) Imaging Spectrometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed Carbon Investigation (Carbon-I) Imaging Spectrometer is designed to measure variations of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere. The instrument will survey the Earth from its own spacecraft at an altitude of approximately 610 km. It will use a coarse ground sampling distance (GSD) of &lt;400 m in global mode for land and coastal monitoring and finer 35 m GSD in target mode to sample key regions. The identification and quantification of greenhouse gases require continuous spectral sampling over the 2040-2380 nm wavelength range with &lt;1 nm spectral sampling. The proposed design builds upon Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) experience of spaceflight Dyson imaging spectrometers to achieve spectral sampling of 0.7 nm per pixel. This paper presents the proposed Carbon-I optical design comprised of a freeform three-mirror anastigmat telescope that couples to a F/2.2, highly uniform Dyson-inspired imaging spectrometer. The high uniformity and throughput enables Carbon-I to measure Earth's greenhouse gas concentrations with unprecedented precision and spatial sampling.</description>

      <title>ExoPhoto: A Database of Temperature-Dependent Photodissociation Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ExoPhoto database (https://exomol.com/exophoto/), an extension of the ExoMol database, specifically developed to address the growing need for high-accuracy, temperature-dependent photodissociation cross section data towards short-UV wavelengths. ExoPhoto combines theoretical models from three major computational databases (ExoMol, UGAMOP and PhoMol) and experimental datasets from two experimental groups, providing extensive wavelength and temperature coverage. ExoPhoto currently includes photodissociation data for 20 molecules: AlH, HCl, HF, MgH, OH, NaO, MgO, O2, AlCl, AlF, CS, HeH+, CO, CO2, H2O, SO2, C2H2, C2H4, H2CO, and NH3, derived from theoretical models and supported by experimental data from 5 databases.
  ExoPhoto also includes detailed data on branching ratios and quantum yields for selected datasets. The data structure of ExoPhoto follows the ExoMol framework, with a consistent naming convention and hierarchical JSON-based organization. Photodissociation cross sections are stored in a set of .photo files which provide data as a function of wavelength with one file for each target molecule temperature. Future developments aim to include more photodissociation cross section data and to provide data for molecules in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE). These will expand the utility of ExoPhoto for advanced astrophysical, planetary modeling and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Applying TDI to Hardware-Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many years of development have gone into producing instruments that meet the required noise performance of the LISA interferometric detection system. Concurrently, software simulations have been used to extensively develop the data analysis libraries to be used in the LISA pipeline, not least among which are the Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) algorithms. To bridge the gap between these two, we are developing a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to apply realistic, time-varying delays to signals traveling between phasemeters. We have shown that the testbed adds a sufficiently low amount of noise across the entire relevant LISA spectrum. We have also injected a realistic gravitational wave signal, generated via the LISA Data Challenge codebase, and successfully extracted it using TDI to remove the obscuring frequency noise of the carrier signal. Future efforts will expand the testbed to create a representative simulation of the entire LISA constellation, with an eye towards its use as a tool to aid in the development of the LISA data analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Energy and polarization based on-line interference mitigation in radio interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a persistent contaminant in terrestrial radio astronomy. While new radio interferometers are becoming operational, novel sources of RFI are also emerging. In order to strengthen the mitigation of RFI in modern radio interferometers, we propose an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be run in the correlator of such interferometers. We combine statistics based on the energy as well as the polarization alignment of the correlated signal to develop an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be applied to a data stream produced by the correlator in real-time, especially targeted at low duty-cycle or transient RFI detection. In order to improve the computational efficiency, we explore the use of both single precision and half precision floating point operations in implementing the RFI mitigation algorithm. This ideally suits its deployment in accelerator computing devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs) as used by the LOFAR correlator. We provide results based on real data to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Filling the gap in the IERS C01 polar motion series in 1858.9-1860.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The C01 Earth orientation parameters (EOP) series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is the longest reliable record of the Earth's rotation. In particular, the polar motion (PM) series beginning from 1846 provides a basis for investigation of the long-term PM variations. However, the pole coordinate $Y_p$ in the IERS C01 PM series has a 2-year gap, which makes this series not completely evenly spaced. This paper presents the results of the first attempt to overcome this problem and discusses some ways to fill this gap. Two novel approaches were considered for this purpose: parametric astronomical model consisting of the bias and the Chandler and annual wobbles with linearly changing amplitudes, and data-driven model based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Both methods were tested with various options to ensure robust and reliable results. The results obtained by the two methods generally agree within the $Y_p$ errors in the IERS C01 series, but the results obtained by the SSA approach can be considered preferable because it is based on a more complete PM model.</description>

      <title>StarFlow: Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Stellar Age Estimation in SDSS-V DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ages of stars is crucial for unraveling the formation history and evolution of our Galaxy. Traditional methods for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic data often struggle with providing appropriate uncertainty estimations and are severely constrained by the parameter space. In this work, we introduce a new approach using normalizing flows, a type of deep generative model, to estimate stellar ages for evolved stars with improved accuracy and robust uncertainty characterization. The model is trained on stellar masses for evolved stars derived from asteroseismology and predicts the relationship between the carbon and nitrogen abundances of a given star and its age. Unlike standard neural network techniques, normalizing flows enable the recovery of full likelihood distributions for individual stellar ages, offering a richer and more informative perspective on uncertainties. Our method yields age estimations for 378,720 evolved stars and achieves a typical absolute age uncertainty of approximately 2 Gyr. By intrinsically accounting for the coverage and density of the training data, our model ensures that the resulting uncertainties reflect both the inherent noise in the data and the completeness of the sampled parameter space. Applying this method to data from the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, we have produced the largest stellar age catalog for evolved stars to date.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to optimizing the image cleaning performance of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes: Application to a time-based cleaning for H.E.S.S</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a time-based cleaning method for H.E.S.S. using CT5 in monoscopic mode and presents an optimization workflow for image-cleaning algorithms to enhance telescope sensitivity while minimizing systematic biases. We evaluate three methods - tail-cut cleaning and two flavours of time-based cleaning TIME3D and TIME4D - and find best-cut configurations for two cases: optimal overall sensitivity and minimal energy threshold. TIME3D achieves a $\sim 15\%$ improvement with regard to the standard tail-cut cleaning for $E &lt; 300$ GeV, with a $\sim 200\%$ improvement for the first energy bin (36.5 GeV &lt; E &lt; 64.9 GeV), providing a more stable performance across a wider energy range by preserving more signal. TIME4D achieves a $\sim 20\%$ improvement at low energies due to superior NSB noise suppression, allowing for an enhanced capability of detecting sources at the lowest energies. We demonstrate that using first-order estimations of the performance of a cleaning, such as image size retaining or NSB pixel reduction, cannot provide a full picture of the expected result in the final sensitivity. Beyond expanding the effective area at low energies, sensitivity improvement requires precise event reconstruction, including improved energy and directional accuracy. Enhanced gamma-hadron separation and optimized pre-selection cuts further boost sensitivity. The proposed pipeline fully explores this, providing a fair and robust comparison between different cleaning methods. The method is general and can be applied to other IACT systems like VERITAS, MAGIC. By advancing data-driven image cleaning, this work lays the groundwork for detecting faint astrophysical sources and deepening our understanding of high-energy cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphology Classification via Deep Semi-Supervised Learning with Limited Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology classification plays a crucial role in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. With galaxy observation data growing exponentially, machine learning has become a core technology for this classification task. However, traditional machine learning methods predominantly rely on supervised learning frameworks, and their dependence on large of labeled samples limits practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN, designed to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited labeled data. This model integrates semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN) with Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), establishing a multi-task learning framework. Within this framework, the discriminator and classifier are designed independently while sharing part of the architecture. By collaborating with the generator, the model significantly enhances both classification performance and sample generation capabilities, while also improving convergence and stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, GC-SWGAN achieves comparable or even superior classification accuracy (exceeding 75%) using only one-fifth of the labeled samples typically required by conventional fully supervised methods. Under identical labeled conditions, the model displays excellent generalization performance, attaining approximately 84% classification accuracy. Notably, in extreme scenarios where only 10\% of the data is labeled, GC-SWGAN still achieves high classification accuracy (over 68%), fully demonstrating its stability and effectiveness in low-labeled data environments. Furthermore, galaxy images generated by GC-SWGAN are visually similar to real samples.</description>

      <title>GReX: An Instrument Overview and New Upper Limits on the Galactic FRB Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the instrument design and initial results for the Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX), an all-sky monitor for exceptionally bright transients in the radio sky. This instrument builds on the success of STARE2 to search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the Milky Way and its satellites. This instrument has deployments across the globe, with wide sky coverage and searching down to $32\,\mu\text{s}$ time resolution, enabling the discovery of new super giant pulses. Presented here are the details of the hardware and software design of the instrument, performance in sensitivity and other key metrics, and experience in building a global-scale, low-cost experiment. We follow this discussion with experimental results on validation of the sensitivity via hydrogen-line measurements. We then update the rate of Galactic FRBs based on non-detection in the time since FRB 200428. Our results suggest FRB-like events are even rarer than initially implied by the detection of a MJy burst from SGR J1935+2154 in April 2020.</description>

      <title>AstroVisBench: A Code Benchmark for Scientific Computing and Visualization in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.</description>
