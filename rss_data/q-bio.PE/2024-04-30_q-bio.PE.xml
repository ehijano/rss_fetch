      <title>Nested Inheritance Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of the inheritance of biological processes, such as the developmental process or the life cycle of an organism, has been discussed in the biology literature, but formal mathematical descriptions and plausible data analysis frameworks are lacking. We introduce an extension of the nested Dirichlet Process (nDP) to a multiscale model to aid in understanding the mechanisms by which biological processes are inherited, remain stable, and are modified across generations. To address these issues, we introduce Nested Inheritance Dynamics Algorithm (NIDA). At its primary level, NIDA encompasses all processes unfolding within an individual organism's lifespan. The secondary level delineates the dynamics through which these processes evolve or remain stable over time. This framework allows for the specification of a physical system model at either scale, thus promoting seamless integration with established models of development and heredity.</description>

      <title>Assessing biological control method on the progression of anaplasmosis disease in dominant cattle species in the Matabeleland north province Zimbabwe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of Anaplasmosis in resource limited farmers cattle subjected to a biological control method. The study seeks to evaluate the stability and control of cattle herds dynamics relative to finite agitation. Anaplasmosis disease pose a major threat in eradicating cattle population growth in resources limited communities. In gaining the insight of the disease, the following model analysis strategies were used in order to compute simulations, analysis of the model upon varying initial predator population and testing the effects of different predation rate on the disease dynamics. It is essential that the progression of Anaplasmosis be stable after the introduction of tick predators into cattle-tick system because that provides the usability of predation as a control measure. After analysing the effect of different prediction rates on the spread of the disease in resource limited communities the study asserted that tick predators like birds and bacteria have been neglected as contributors to natural mechanism of Anaplasmosis. Furthermore, the study brought to light that predictors have been neglected as major contributors to natural control mechanism of Anaplasmosis in Zimbabwe. Additional numerical simulations showed that predation method can be used in the eradication of Anaplasmosis disease thus improving rural livelihood. Investigation of natural tick enemies and predation behaviour can lead to better control of the Anaplasmosis disease efficiently and effectively. Finally, we recommend the necessity for resource limited farmers to capitalise on the use of biological disease control measures.</description>

      <title>Coupling in situ and remote sensing data to assess $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity over biogeographic gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenges presented by climate change are escalating and pose significant threats to global biodiversity, which in turn increases the risk of species extinctions. Therefore, meticulous monitoring efforts are necessary to mitigate the consequential impacts on both human well-being and environmental equilibrium. Biodiversity mapping is pivotal for establishing conservation priorities, often accomplished by assessing alpha, beta, and gamma diversity levels. Two main data sources, in situ and remote sensing (RS) data, are key for this task. In situ methods entail direct data collection from specific study areas, offering detailed insights into ecological patterns, albeit limited by resource constraints. Conversely, RS provides a broader observational platform, albeit at lower spatial resolution than in situ approaches. RS-derived diversity metrics have potential, particularly in linking spectral and biological diversity through high-resolution imagery for precise differentiation at fine scales. Coupling in situ and RS data underscores their complementary nature, contingent upon various factors including study scale and logistical considerations. In situ methods excel in precision, while RS offers efficiency and broader coverage. Despite prior investigations predominantly relying on limited datasets, our study endeavors to employ both in situ and RS data to assess plant and spectral species diversity across France at a high spatial resolution, integrating diverse metrics to unravel different biogeographical structures while gaining in understanding the relationship between plant and spectral diversity within and across bioregions.</description>

      <title>Effects of phase separation on extinction times in population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of phase separating diffusive dynamics on the mean time to extinction in several reaction-diffusion models with slow reactions. We consider a continuum theory similar to model AB, and a simple model where individual particles on two sites undergo on-site reactions and hopping between the sites. In the slow-reaction limit, we project the models' dynamics onto suitable one-dimensional reaction coordinates, which allows derivation of quasi-equilibrium effective free energies. For weak noise, this enables characterisation of the mean time to extinction. This time can be enhanced or suppressed by the addition of phase separation, compared with homogeneous reference cases. We also discuss how Allee effects can be affected by phase separation.</description>

      <title>Non-Spatial Hash Chemistry as a Minimalistic Open-Ended Evolutionary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an increasing level of interest in open-endedness in the recent literature of Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence. We previously proposed the cardinality leap of possibility spaces as a promising mechanism to facilitate open-endedness in artificial evolutionary systems, and demonstrated its effectiveness using Hash Chemistry, an artificial chemistry model that used a hash function as a universal fitness evaluator. However, the spatial nature of Hash Chemistry came with extensive computational costs involved in its simulation, and the particle density limit imposed to prevent explosion of computational costs prevented unbounded growth in complexity of higher-order entities. To address these limitations, here we propose a simpler non-spatial variant of Hash Chemistry in which spatial proximity of particles are represented explicitly in the form of multisets. This model modification achieved a significant reduction of computational costs in simulating the model. Results of numerical simulations showed much more significant unbounded growth in both maximal and average sizes of replicating higher-order entities than the original model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this non-spatial model as a minimalistic example of open-ended evolutionary systems.</description>

      <title>Learning epidemic trajectories through Kernel Operator Learning: from modelling to optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since infectious pathogens start spreading into a susceptible population, mathematical models can provide policy makers with reliable forecasts and scenario analyses, which can be concretely implemented or solely consulted. In these complex epidemiological scenarios, machine learning architectures can play an important role, since they directly reconstruct data-driven models circumventing the specific modelling choices and the parameter calibration, typical of classical compartmental models. In this work, we discuss the efficacy of Kernel Operator Learning (KOL) to reconstruct population dynamics during epidemic outbreaks, where the transmission rate is ruled by an input strategy. In particular, we introduce two surrogate models, named KOL-m and KOL-$\partial$, which reconstruct in two different ways the evolution of the epidemics. Moreover, we evaluate the generalization performances of the two approaches with different kernels, including the Neural Tangent Kernels, and compare them with a classical neural network model learning method. Employing synthetic but semi-realistic data, we show how the two introduced approaches are suitable for realizing fast and robust forecasts and scenario analyses, and how these approaches are competitive for determining optimal intervention strategies with respect to specific performance measures.</description>
