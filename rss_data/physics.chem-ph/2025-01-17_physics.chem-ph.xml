      <title>Selective Excitation of IR-Inactive Vibrations via Vibrational Polaritons: Insights from Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational polaritons, hybrid light-matter states formed between molecular vibrations and infrared (IR) cavity modes, provide a novel approach for modifying chemical reaction pathways and energy transfer processes. For vibrational polaritons involving condensed-phase molecules, the short polariton lifetime raises debate over whether pumping polaritons may produce different effects on molecules compared to directly exciting the molecules in free space or under weak coupling. Here, for liquid methane under vibrational strong coupling, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that pumping the upper polariton (UP) formed by the asymmetric bending mode of methane can sometimes selectively excite the IR-inactive symmetric bending mode. Both numerical evidence and analytical theory suggest that this polariton-induced energy transfer reaches maximal efficiency when the UP has significant contributions from both photons and molecules, underscoring the importance of light-matter hybridization. Since IR-inactive vibrational modes are generally inaccessible to direct IR excitation, our study highlights the unique role of polariton formation in selectively controlling IR-inactive vibrations. This polariton-induced process may impact IR photochemistry on a timescale longer than the polariton lifetime as observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Effects of Natural Biosurfactant and Metal Oxides Modification on PVDF Nanofiber Filters for Efficient Microplastic and Oil Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The removal of microplastics and oil from oil-water emulsions presents significant challenges in membrane technology due to issues with low permeability, rejection rates, and membrane fouling. This study focuses on enhancing nanofibrous composite membranes to effectively separate microplastic contaminants (0.5 micrometer) and oil-water emulsions in wastewater. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric nanofibers were produced using a needle-free electrospinning technique and attached to a nonwoven surface through lamination. The membranes were modified with alkaline treatment, biosurfactant (BS), $TiO_2$, and CuO particles to prevent fouling and improve separation efficiency. The modified membranes demonstrated exceptional water permeability, with BS-modified membranes reaching above 9000 $Lm^{-2} h^{-1} bar^{-1}$ for microplastic separation. However, BS modifications led to reduced water permeability during oil-water emulsion treatment. $TiO_2$ and CuO further enhanced permeability and reduced fouling. The $TiO_2$-modified membranes exhibited superior performance in oil-water emulsion separation, maintaining high oil rejection rates (~95%) and antifouling properties. The maximum microplastic and oil rejection rates were of 99.99% and 95.30%, respectively. This study illustrates the successful modification of membrane surfaces to improve the separation of microplastics and oil-water emulsions, offering significant advancements in wastewater treatment technology.</description>

      <title>Extending the rotational spectrum of cyclopentadiene towards higher frequencies and vibrational states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclopentadiene (c-C5H6) is a cyclic pure hydrocarbon that was already detected astronomically towards the prototypical dark cloud TMC-1 (Cernicharo et al. 2021, Astron. Astrophys. 649, L15). However, accurate predictions of its rotational spectrum are still limited to the microwave region and narrow quantum number ranges. In the present study, the pure rotational spectrum of cyclopentadiene was measured in the frequency ranges 170-250 GHz and 340-510 GHz to improve the number of ground vibrational state assignments by more than a factor of 20, resulting in more accurate rotational parameters and the determination of higher-order centrifugal distortion parameters.
  Additionally, vibrational satellite spectra of cyclopentadiene in its eight energetically lowest vibrationally excited states were analyzed for the first time. Coriolis interactions between selected vibrational states were identified and treated successfully in combined fits. Previous microwave work on the three singly 13C substituted isotopologues was extended significantly also covering frequency ranges up to 250 GHz. The new data sets permit reliable frequency predictions for the isotopologues and vibrational satellite spectra far into the sub-mm-wave range.
  Finally, the experimental rotational constants of all available isotopologues and calculated zero-point vibrational contributions to the rotational constants were used to derive a semi-experimental equilibrium structure of this fundamental ring molecule.</description>

      <title>On the First-Passage Time Fluctuation Theorem in Complex Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer uniform, resulting in a breakdown of this relation. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis, as we (i) determine the circumstances under which this fluctuation theorem can be restored; (ii) assess what its violation reveals about the hidden dynamics; and (iii) characterize the general form of the deviation from this relation. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain some surprising and fairly straightforward results from relatively complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be written for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of complex networks. The validity of this relation can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, which indicates that the kinetic branching ratio, defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one, is bounded by the entropy production associated with the first-passage work (i.e., the work applied along a first-passage trajectory). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics in complex biomolecular networks.</description>

      <title>Advancements and Challenges in Sintering Cr4+:YAG Ceramics: A Comprehensive Review on Transparent Ceramic Technology for Q-switched Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resent progress in the technology of transparent ceramics extends the application of CW and pulsed lasers. The parameters of the transparent ceramics are comparable with the single crystals both for active elements (Nd:YAG, Yb:YAG, etc.) and passive Q-switchers such as Cr4+:YAG. Despite the reaching of considerable progress, the sintering of Cr4+:YAG remains a challenge up to now. Up to the present the influence of the CaO, MgO and Cr2O3 additives on the sintering process is poorly understander. Moreover, there is an absence of the unified model of Cr4+ ions formations in YAG ceramics. This factor limits the progress in the development of Cr4+:YAG ceramics. This review focused on the influence of the single additives and their combinations on the sintering trajectory of tetravalent chromium - doped YAG ceramics and the Cr4+ ions formation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic electron energy-loss spectroscopy in cylindrical waveguides and holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swift electrons passing near or through metallic structures have proven to be an excellent tool for studying plasmons and other types of confined optical modes involving collective charge oscillations in the materials hybridized with electromagnetic fields. In this work, we provide a general analytical framework for the simulation of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in infinite systems with cylindrical symmetry, such as wires, holes, and optical fibers. While EELS theory is well developed for electrons moving parallel to the direction of translational symmetry, we introduce closed-form analytical solutions for perpendicular electron trajectories. These analytical results are corroborated by comparison to numerical simulations based on a frequency-domain boundary-element method and a discontinuous-Galerkin time-domain finite-element method. Numerical methods further allow us to study termination effects in finite-sized cylindrical objects such as nanorods. The present study of the interaction between free electrons and cylindrically symmetric photonics systems can find application in the analysis of EELS spectra and the design of free-electron--photonic hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Influence of (n-1)d Subvalence Correlation and of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Chalcogen Bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive computational investigation into chalcogen bonding interactions, focusing specifically on elucidating the role of subvalence (n$-$1)d and (n$-$1)sp correlation. The incorporation of inner-shell (n$-$1)d correlation leads to a decrease in interaction energies for chalcogen-bonded systems (at least those studied herein), contradicting the observations regarding halogen bonding documented by Kesharwani et al. in \textit{J. Phys. Chem. A}, \textbf{2018}, 122 (8), 2184-2197. The significance of (n$-$1)sp subvalence correlation appears to be lower by an order of magnitude. Notably, among the various components of interaction energies computed at the PNO-LCCSD(T) or DF-CCSD levels, we identify the PNO-LMP2 or DF-MP2 component of the (n$-$1)d correlation as predominant. Furthermore, we delve into the impact of second-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC2) on these interactions. Specifically, for the Te complexes, SOC2 effects rival (n$-$1)d correlation in importance; for the Se complexes, SOC2 is much less important. Generally, SOC2 stabilizes monomers more than dimers, resulting in reduced binding of the latter. Notably, at equilibrium and stretched geometries, SOC2 and (n$-$1)d destabilize the complex; however, at compressed geometries, they exhibit opposing effects, with (n$-$1)d becoming stabilizing.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study on the dynamics and spectroscopy of collective rovibrational polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate rovibrational molecular models are employed to gain insight in high-resolution into the collective effects and intermolecular processes arising when molecules in the gas phase are interacting with a resonant infrared (IR) radiation mode. An efficient theoretical approach is detailed and numerical results are presented for the HCl, H$_2$O and CH$_4$ molecules confined in an IR cavity. It is shown that by employing a rotationally resolved model for the molecules, revealing the various cavity-mediated interactions between the field-free molecular eigenstates, it is possible to obtain a detailed understanding of the physical processes governing the energy level structure, absorbtion spectra, and dynamic behavior of the confined systems. Collective effects, arising due to the cavity-mediated interaction between molecules, are identified in energy level shifts, in intensity borrowing effects in the absorbtion spectra, and in the intermolecular energy transfer occurring during Hermitian or non-Hermitian time propagation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Nonadiabatic Dynamics: Eliminating Phase Freedom of Nonadiabatic Couplings with the State-Intraction State-Averaged Spin-Restricted Ensemble-Referenced Kohn-Sham Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excited-state molecular dynamics (ESMD) simulations near conical intersections (CIs) pose significant challenges when using machine learning potentials (MLPs). Although MLPs have gained recognition for their integration into mixed quantum-classical (MQC) methods, such as trajectory surface hopping (TSH), and their capacity to model correlated electron-nuclear dynamics efficiently, difficulties persist in managing nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, singularities at CIs and double-valued coupling elements result in discontinuities that disrupt the smoothness of predictive functions. Partial solutions have been provided by learning diabatic Hamiltonians with phaseless loss functions to these challenges. However, a definitive method for addressing the discontinuities caused by CIs and double-valued coupling elements has yet to be developed. Here, we introduce the phaseless coupling term, $\Delta^2$, derived from the square of the off-diagonal elements of the diabatic Hamiltonian in the state-interaction state-averaged spin-restricted ensemble-referenced Kohn-Sham (SI-SA-REKS, briefly SSR)(2,2) formalism. This approach improves the stability and accuracy of the MLP model by addressing the issues arising from CI singularities and double-valued coupling functions. We apply this method to the penta-2,4-dieniminium cation (PSB3), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving MLP training for ML-based nonadiabatic dynamics. Our results show that the $\Delta^2$ based ML-ESMD method can reproduce ab initio ESMD simulations, underscoring its potential and efficiency for broader applications, particularly in large-scale and long-timescale ESMD simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of capillary waves in miscible co-flowing fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Ion correlations explain kinetic selectivity in diffusion-limited solid state synthesis reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing viable solid-state synthesis pathways for novel inorganic materials remains a major challenge in materials science. Previous pathway design methods using pair-wise reaction approaches have navigated the thermodynamic landscape with first-principles data but lack kinetic information, limiting their effectiveness. This gap leads to suboptimal precursor selection and predictions, especially for reactions forming competing phases with similar formation energies, where ion diffusion is a critical influence. Here, we demonstrate an inorganic synthesis framework by incorporating machine learning-derived transport properties through "liquid-like" product layers into a thermodynamic cellular reaction model. In the Ba-Ti-O system, known for its competitive polymorphism, we obtain accurate predictions of phase formation with varying BaO:TiO2 ratios as a function of time and temperature. We find that diffusion-thermodynamic interplay governs phase compositions, with cross-ion transport coefficients critical for predicting diffusion-limited selectivity. This work bridges length and time scales by integrating solid-state reaction kinetics with first-principles thermodynamics and spatial reactivity.</description>
