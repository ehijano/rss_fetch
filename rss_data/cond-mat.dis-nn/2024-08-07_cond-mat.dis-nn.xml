      <title>Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02835v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</description>

      <title>Relationship between the shear modulus and volume relaxation in high-entropy metallic glasses: experiment and physical origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed parallel measurements of the high-frequency shear modulus $G$ and relative volume $\Delta V/V$ for high-entropy Ti$_{20}$Zr$_{20}$Hf$_{20}$Be$_{20}$Cu$_{20}$ and Ti$_{20}$Zr$_{20}$Hf$_{20}$Be$_{20}$Ni$_{20}$ glasses upon heating from room temperature up to the complete crystallization. The changes of these properties due to structural relaxation both below and above the glass transition temperature are singled out. It is shown that these changes for both initial and preannealed samples can be well described within the framework of the Interstitialcy theory. It is found that the whole relaxation process in the full temperature range of the experiments for both samples' states can be characterized by a single dimensionless temperature-independent parameter $K_i=dln\;G/dln\;V$, which equals to -44 and -53 for the above glasses, respectively, and strongly points at interstitial-type defects as a source of relaxation. We also show that the relaxation of the relative volume linearly depends on the defect concentration. This behavior can be described by another dimensionless temperature-independent parameter, which is related with the relaxation volume of defects. Possible contribution of vacancy-like defects into the relaxation is discussed.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolded Local Quantum Annealing</title>

Abstract: Local quantum annealing (LQA), an iterative algorithm, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It draws inspiration from QA, which utilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given objective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized via gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the parameters. Owing to the non-convex nature of the original cost function, LQA often becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us to tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. Our findings demonstrate that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA, exhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the trained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system sizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable insights for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Competition between Kondo Effect and RKKY Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When magnetic moments are immersed into the Fermi sea of itinerant electrons, rich quantum physics emerges. This is relevant for a wide range of materials including heavy Fermion systems, high temperature superconductors like the cuprates, but also good metals with magnetic impurities, doped semiconductors like Si:P close to the metal-insulator transition, 2D materials like graphene and topological insulators. While each material has its specific properties, requiring detailed modelling, their electronic properties are to some degree governed by the competition between Kondo screening and indirect exchange couplings. In these lecture notes we give an introduction, starting with a review of formation of magnetic moments, the theory of the Kondo effect for a single magnetic impurity in a metal host and the derivation of RKKY coupling between magnetic impurities in a metal host. We review the Doniach diagram and Kondo lattice physics and give an introduction to a self consistent renormalization group theory, taking into account Kondo effect and RKKY coupling between magnetic impurities and review results obtained thereby. We review the effect of gaps and pseudo gaps on Kondo effect and RKKY couplings, and on their competition. Especially for dilute concentration of magnetic moments, disorder effects from randomly distributed impurities result in a distribution of both Kondo temperatures and RKKY couplings. Then, their competition becomes an even more complex problem. Moreover, disorder induced Anderson localization transitions may occur, affecting both Kondo effect and RKKY coupling severely, and changing their competition. These disorder effects on the spin competition are introduced and recent results are reviewed. We conclude with an outlook and list of, in our view, most pressing and interesting open problems.</description>

      <title>Coercivity influence of nanostructure in SmCo-1:7 magnets: Machine learning of high-throughput micromagnetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 17,000 micromagnetic simulations were performed with a wide variation of geometric and magnetic parameters of different cellular nanostructures in the samarium-cobalt-based 1:7-type (SmCo-1:7) magnets. A forward prediction neural network (NN) model is trained to unveil the influence of these parameters on the coercivity of materials, along with the sensitivity analysis. Results indicate the important role of the 1:5-phase in enhancing coercivity. Moreover, an inverse design NN model is obtained to suggest the nanostructure for a queried coercivity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Cooperativity, information gain, and energy cost during early LTP in dendritic spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.</description>
