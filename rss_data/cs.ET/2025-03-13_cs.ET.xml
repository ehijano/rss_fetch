      <title>City Models: Past, Present and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to take a comprehensive look at the challenges of representing the spatio-temporal structures and dynamic processes defining a city's overall characteristics. For the task of urban planning and urban operation, we take the stance that even if the necessary representations of these structures and processes can be achieved, the most important representation of the relevant mindsets of the citizens are, unfortunately, mostly neglected.
  After a review of major "traditional" urban models of structures behind urban scale, form, and dynamics, we turn to major recent modeling approaches triggered by recent advances in AI that enable multi-modal generative models. Some of these models can create representations of geometries, networks and images, and reason flexibly at a human-compatible semantic level. They provide huge amounts of knowledge extracted from Terabytes of text and image documents and cover the required rich representation spectrum including geographic knowledge by different knowledge sources, degrees of granularity and scales.
  We then discuss what these new opportunities mean for the modeling challenges posed by cities, in particular with regard to the role and impact of citizens and their interactions within the city infrastructure. We propose to integrate these possibilities with existing approaches, such as agent-based models, which opens up new modeling spaces including rich citizen models which are able to also represent social interactions.
  Finally, we put forward some thoughts about a vision of a "social AI in a city ecosystem" that adds relevant citizen models to state-of-the-art structural and process models. This extended city representation will enable urban planners to establish citizen-oriented planning of city infrastructures for human culture, city resilience and sustainability.</description>

      <title>Receding Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural Control and State Estimation for Closed-Loop Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01297v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper formalizes Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural (Hion) controllers, a novel class of neural network-based controllers for dynamical systems and explicit non-linear model predictive control. Hion controllers estimate future states and compute optimal control inputs using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The proposed framework allows for customization of transient behavior, addressing limitations of existing methods. The Taylored Multi-Faceted Approach for Neural ODE and Optimal Control (T-mano) architecture facilitates training and ensures accurate state estimation. Optimal control strategies are demonstrated for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A Secure Blockchain-Assisted Framework for Real-Time Maritime Environmental Compliance Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maritime industry is governed by stringent environmental regulations, most notably the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Ensuring compliance with these regulations is difficult due to low inspection rates and the risk of data fabrication. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure blockchain-assisted framework for real-time maritime environmental compliance monitoring. By integrating IoT and shipboard sensors with blockchain technology, the framework ensures immutable and transparent record-keeping of environmental data. Smart contracts automate compliance verification and notify relevant authorities in case of non-compliance. A proof-of-concept case study on sulfur emissions demonstrates the framework's efficacy in enhancing MARPOL enforcement through real-time data integrity and regulatory adherence. The proposed system leverages the Polygon blockchain for scalability and efficiency, providing a robust solution for maritime environmental protection. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed blockchain-enhanced compliance monitoring system effectively and securely ensures real-time regulatory adherence with high scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, leveraging the robust capabilities of the Polygon blockchain.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.</description>

      <title>ResBench: Benchmarking LLM-Generated FPGA Designs with Resource Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in modern hardware design, yet writing Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for FPGA implementation remains labor-intensive and complex. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automating HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM HDL code generation primarily evaluate functional correctness while overlooking the critical aspect of hardware resource efficiency. Moreover, current benchmarks lack diversity, failing to capture the broad range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these gaps, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-oriented benchmark explicitly designed to differentiate between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our evaluation framework systematically integrates FPGA resource constraints, with a primary focus on Lookup Table (LUT) usage, enabling a realistic assessment of hardware efficiency. Experimental results reveal substantial differences in resource utilization across LLMs, demonstrating ResBench's effectiveness in distinguishing models based on their ability to generate resource-optimized FPGA designs.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of LLMs for Detecting Harmful Computing Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting harmful and non-inclusive terminology in technical contexts is critical for fostering inclusive environments in computing. This study explores the impact of model architecture on harmful language detection by evaluating a curated database of technical terms, each paired with specific use cases. We tested a range of encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder language models, including BERT-base-uncased, RoBERTa large-mnli, Gemini Flash 1.5 and 2.0, GPT-4, Claude AI Sonnet 3.5, T5-large, and BART-large-mnli. Each model was presented with a standardized prompt to identify harmful and non-inclusive language across 64 terms. Results reveal that decoder models, particularly Gemini Flash 2.0 and Claude AI, excel in nuanced contextual analysis, while encoder models like BERT exhibit strong pattern recognition but struggle with classification certainty. We discuss the implications of these findings for improving automated detection tools and highlight model-specific strengths and limitations in fostering inclusive communication in technical domains.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity Education: A Novel Curriculum for Enhancing Graduate STEM Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm with the potential to transform numerous application areas by addressing problems considered intractable in the classical domain. However, its integration into cyberspace introduces significant security and privacy challenges. The exponential rise in cyber attacks, further complicated by quantum capabilities, poses serious risks to financial systems and national security. The scope of quantum threats extends beyond traditional software, operating system, and network vulnerabilities, necessitating a shift in cybersecurity education. Traditional cybersecurity education, often reliant on didactic methods, lacks hands on, student centered learning experiences necessary to prepare students for these evolving challenges. There is an urgent need for curricula that address both classical and quantum security threats through experiential learning. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of EE 597: Introduction to Hardware Security, a graduate level course integrating hands-on quantum security learning with classical security concepts through simulations and cloud-based quantum hardware. Unlike conventional courses focused on quantum threats to cryptographic systems, EE 597 explores security challenges specific to quantum computing itself. We employ a mixed-methods evaluation using pre and post surveys to assess student learning outcomes and engagement. Results indicate significant improvements in students' understanding of quantum and hardware security, with strong positive feedback on course structure and remote instruction (mean scores: 3.33 to 3.83 on a 4 point scale).</description>

      <title>Context-aware Constrained Reinforcement Learning Based Energy-Efficient Power Scheduling for Non-stationary XR Data Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In XR downlink transmission, energy-efficient power scheduling (EEPS) is essential for conserving power resource while delivering large data packets within hard-latency constraints. Traditional constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithms show promise in EEPS but still struggle with non-convex stochastic constraints, non-stationary data traffic, and sparse delayed packet dropout feedback (rewards) in XR. To overcome these challenges, this paper models the EEPS in XR as a dynamic parameter-constrained Markov decision process (DP-CMDP) with a varying transition function linked to the non-stationary data traffic and solves it by a proposed context-aware constrained reinforcement learning (CACRL) algorithm, which consists of a context inference (CI) module and a CRL module. The CI module trains an encoder and multiple potential networks to characterize the current transition function and reshape the packet dropout rewards according to the context, transforming the original DP-CMDP into a general CMDP with immediate dense rewards. The CRL module employs a policy network to make EEPS decisions under this CMDP and optimizes the policy using a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method, which is better suited for non-convex stochastic constraints. Finally, theoretical analyses provide deep insights into the CADAC algorithm, while extensive simulations demonstrate that it outperforms advanced baselines in both power conservation and satisfying packet dropout constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of Industry 4.0 technologies requires robust and comprehensive standardization to ensure interoperability, safety and efficiency in the Industry of the Future. This paper examines the fundamental role and functionality of standardization, with a particular focus on its importance in Europe's regulatory framework. Based on this, selected topics in context of standardization activities in context intelligent manufacturing and digital twins are highlighted and, by that, an overview of the Industry 4.0 standards framework is provided. This paper serves both as an informative guide to the existing standards in Industry 4.0 with respect to Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twins, and as a call to action for increased cooperation between standardization bodies and the research community. By fostering such collaboration, we aim to facilitate the continued development and implementation of standards that will drive innovation and progress in the manufacturing sector.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Controlled Magnetoelectric Devices for Neuromorphic Diffusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic diffusion processes are pervasive in nature, from the seemingly erratic Brownian motion to the complex interactions of synaptically-coupled spiking neurons. Recently, drawing inspiration from Langevin dynamics, neuromorphic diffusion models were proposed and have become one of the major breakthroughs in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models as well as other generative models such as ChatGPT aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today's technologies, creating a bottleneck in their efficiency, and impeding further development. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Frechet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~10^3 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.</description>

      <title>QuSplit: Achieving Both High Fidelity and Throughput via Job Splitting on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the progression into the quantum utility era, computing is shifting toward quantum-centric architectures, where multiple quantum processors collaborate with classical computing resources. Platforms such as IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket exemplify this trend, enabling access to diverse quantum backends. However, efficient resource management remains a challenge, as quantum processors are highly susceptible to noise, which significantly impacts computation fidelity. Additionally, the heterogeneous noise characteristics across different processors add further complexity to scheduling and resource allocation. Existing scheduling strategies typically focus on mapping and scheduling jobs to these heterogeneous backends, which leads to some jobs suffering extremely low fidelity. Targeting quantum optimization jobs (e.g., VQC, VQE, QAOA) - among the most promising quantum applications in the NISQ era - we hypothesize that executing the later stages of a job on a high-fidelity quantum processor can significantly improve overall fidelity. To verify this, we use VQE as a case study and develop a Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling framework that incorporates job splitting to optimize fidelity and throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently maintains high fidelity across all jobs while significantly enhancing system throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent scalability in handling an increasing number of quantum processors and larger workloads, making it a robust and practical solution for emerging quantum computing platforms. To further substantiate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a real quantum processor, IBM Strasbourg, which confirm that job splitting improves fidelity and reduces the number of iterations required for convergence.</description>
