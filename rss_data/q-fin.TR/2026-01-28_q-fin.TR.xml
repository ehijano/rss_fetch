      <title>Who Restores the Peg? A Mean-Field Game Approach to Model Stablecoin Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: USDC and USDT are the dominant stablecoins pegged to \$1 with a total market capitalization of over \$300B and rising. Stablecoins make dollar value globally accessible with secure transfer and settlement. Yet in practice, these stablecoins experience periods of stress and de-pegging from their \$1 target, posing significant systemic risks. The behavior of market participants during these stress events and the collective actions that either restore or break the peg are not well understood. This paper addresses the question: who restores the peg? We develop a dynamic, agent-based mean-field game framework for fiat-collateralized stablecoins, in which a large population of arbitrageurs and retail traders strategically interacts across explicit primary (mint/redeem) and secondary (exchange) markets during a de-peg episode. The key advantage of this equilibrium formulation is that it endogenously maps market frictions into a market-clearing price path and implied net order flows, allowing us to attribute peg-reverting pressure by channel and to stress-test when a given mechanism becomes insufficient for recovery. Using three historical de-peg events, we show that the calibrated equilibrium reproduces observed recovery half-lives and yields an order flow decomposition in which system-wide stress is predominantly stabilized by primary-market arbitrage, whereas episodes with impaired primary redemption require a joint recovery via both primary and secondary markets. Finally, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of primary-rail frictions identifies a non-linear breakdown threshold. Beyond this point, secondary-market liquidity acts mainly as a second-order amplifier around this primary-market bottleneck.</description>

      <title>Directional Liquidity and Geometric Shear in Pregeometric Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a structural framework for the geometry of financial order books in which liquidity, supply, and demand are treated as emergent observables rather than primitive market variables. The market is modeled as a relational substrate without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through observation, implemented here as a reduction of relational degrees of freedom followed by a low-dimensional spectral projection. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate and a projected liquidity density around the mid price, from which bid and ask sides emerge as two complementary restrictions. We show that directional liquidity imbalances decompose naturally into a rigid drift of the projected density and a geometric shear mode that deforms the bid--ask structure without inducing price motion. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis, the shear geometry constrains the projected liquidity to a gamma-like functional form, appearing as an integrated-gamma profile in discrete data. Empirical analysis of high-frequency Level~II data across multiple U.S. equities confirms this geometry and shows that it outperforms standard alternative cumulative models under explicit model comparison and residual diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Trade Execution with Market and Limit Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework for optimal trade execution in a limit order book. We formulate the trade execution problem as a dynamic allocation task whose objective is the optimal placement of market and limit orders to maximize expected revenue. By modeling market and limit order allocations with multivariate logistic-normal distributions, the framework enables efficient training of the reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional benchmark strategies in simulated limit order book environments featuring noise traders submitting random orders, tactical traders responding to order book imbalances, and a strategic trader seeking to acquire or liquidate an asset position.</description>
