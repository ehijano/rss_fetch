      <title>Scattering, Polyhomogeneity and Asymptotics for Quasilinear Wave Equations From Past to Future Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general construction of semiglobal scattering solutions to quasilinear wave equations in a neighbourhood of spacelike infinity including past and future null infinity, where the scattering data are posed on an ingoing null cone and along past null infinity. More precisely, we prove weighted, optimal-in-decay energy estimates and propagation of polyhomogeneity statements from past to future null infinity for these solutions, we provide an algorithmic procedure how to compute the precise coefficients in the arising polyhomogeneous expansions, and we apply this procedure to various examples. As a corollary, our results directly imply the summability in the spherical harmonic number $\ell$ of the estimates proved for fixed spherical harmonic modes in the papers [Keh22b,KM24] from the series "The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity".
  Our (physical space) methods are based on weighted energy estimates near spacelike infinity similar to those of [HV23], commutations with (modified) scaling vector fields to remove leading order terms in the relevant expansions, time inversions, as well as the Minkowskian conservation laws: $$
  \partial_u(r^{-2\ell}\partial_v(r^2\partial_v)^{\ell}(r\phi_{\ell}))=0, $$ which are satisfied if $\Box_\eta\phi=0$. Our scattering constructions go beyond the usual class of finite energy solutions and, as a consequence, can be applied directly to the Einstein vacuum equations in harmonic gauge.</description>

      <title>Generalized Doubly Parabolic Keller-Segel System with Fractional Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keller-Segel model is a system of partial differential equations that describes the movement of cells or organisms in response to chemical signals, a phenomenon known as chemotaxis. In this study, we analyze a doubly parabolic Keller-Segel system in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$, where both cellular and chemical diffusion are governed by fractional Laplacians with distinct exponents. This system generalizes the classical Keller-Segel model by introducing superdiffusion, a form of anomalous diffusion. This extension accounts for nonlocal diffusive effects observed in experimental settings, particularly in environments with sparse targets. We establish results on the local well-posedness of mild solutions for this generalized system and global well-posedness under smallness assumptions on the initial conditions in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the solution.</description>

      <title>On the local well-posedness of fractionally dissipated primitive equations with transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional fractionally dissipated primitive equations with transport noise, focusing on subcritical and critical dissipation regimes characterized by $ (-\Delta)^{s/2} $ with $ s \in (1,2)$ and $s = 1$, respectively. For $\sigma&gt;3$, we establish the local existence of unique pathwise solutions in Sobolev space $H^\sigma$. This result applies to arbitrary initial data in the subcritical case ($s \in(1,2)$), and to small initial data in the critical case ($s=1$). The analysis is particularly challenging due to the loss of horizontal derivatives in the nonlinear terms and the lack of full dissipation. To address these challenges, we develop novel commutator estimates involving the hydrostatic Leray projection.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness for the PDE governing the joint law of a diffusion and its running supremum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work [8], it was shown that the joint law of a diffusion process and the running supremum of its first component is absolutely continuous, and that its density satisfies a non standard weak partial differential equation (PDE). In this paper, we establish the uniqueness of the solution to this PDE, providing a more complete understanding of the system's behavior and further validating the approach introduced in [8].</description>

      <title>Convergence and non-convergence to Bose-Einstein condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is a continuation of our previous work on the strong convergence to equilibrium for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Bose-Einstein particles for isotropic solutions at low temperature. Here we study the influence of the particle interaction potentials on the convergence to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Consider two cases of certain potentials that are such that the corresponding scattering cross sections are bounded and 1) have a lower bound ${\rm const.}\min\{1, |{\bf v-v}_*|^{2\eta}\}$ with ${\rm const}.&gt;0, 0\le \eta&lt;1$, and 2) have an upper bound ${\rm const.}\min\{1, |{\bf v-v}_*|^{2\eta}\}$ with $\eta\ge 1$. For the first case, the long time convergence to BEC i.e. $\lim\limits_{t\to\infty}F_t(\{0\})=F_{\rm be}(\{0\})$ is proved for a class of initial data having very low temperature and thus it holds the strong convergence to equilibrium. For the second case we show that if initially $F_0(\{0\})=0$, then $ F_t(\{0\})=0$ for all $t\ge 0$ and thus there is no convergence to BEC hence no strong convergence to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The steady inviscid compressible self-similar flows and the stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady inviscid compressible self-similar flows which depends only on the polar angle in spherical coordinates. It is shown that besides the purely supersonic and subsonic self-similar flows, there exists purely sonic flows, Beltrami flows with a nonconstant proportionnality factor and smooth transonic self-similar flows with large vorticity. For a constant supersonic incoming flow past an infinitely long circular cone, a conic shock attached to the tip of the cone will form, provided the opening angle of the cone is less than a critical value. We introduce the shock polar for the radial and polar components of the velocity and show that there exists a monotonicity relation between the shock angle and the radial velocity, which seems to be new and not been observed before. If a supersonic incoming flow is self-similar with nonzero azimuthal velocity, a conic shock also form attached to the tip of the cone. The state at the downstream may change smoothly from supersonic to subsonic, thus the shock can be supersonic-supersonic, supersonic-subsonic and even supersonic-sonic where the shock front and the sonic front coincide. We further investigate the structural stability of smooth self-similar irrotational transonic flows and analyze the corresponding linear mixed type second order equation of Tricomi type. By exploring some key properties of the self-similar solutions, we find a multiplier and identify a class of admissible boundary conditions for the linearized mixed type second-order equation. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of a class of smooth transonic flows with nonzero vorticity which depends only on the polar and azimuthal angles in spherical coordinates.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates of Mizohata-Takeuchi type for the Navier-Lam\'e operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture for the resolvent of the Navier-Lam\'e equation is a weighted estimate with weights in the so-called Mizohata-Takeuchi class for this operator when one approaches the spectrum (Limiting Absorption Principles). We prove this conjecture in dimensions 2 and 3 for weights with a radial majorant in the Mizohata-Takeuchi class. This result can be seen as an extension of the analogue for the Laplacian given in [8]. We also prove that radial weights in this class are not invariant for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function, hence the methods in [6] used to extend estimates for the Laplacian to the Navier-Lam\'e case, do not work.</description>

      <title>Stationary solutions with vacuum for a hyperbolic-parabolic chemotaxis model in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we study the existence of stationary solutions with vacuum to a hyperbolic-parabolic chemotaxis model with nonlinear pressure in dimension two that describes vasculogenesis. We seek solutions in the radial symmetric class of the whole space, in which the system will be reduced to a system of ODE's on $(0,\infty)$. The fundamental solutions to the ODE system are the Bessel functions of different types. We find two nontrivial solutions. One is formed by half bump (positive density region) starting at $r=0$ and a region of vacuum on the right. Another one is a full nonsymmetric bump away from $r=0$. These solutions bear certain resemblance to in vitro vascular network and the numerically produced structure by Gamba et al arXiv:cond-mat/0303468v1. We also show the nonexistence of full bump starting at $r=0$ and nonexistence of full symmetric bump away from $r=0$.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics approximation schemes for anisotropic mean curvature flows with a forcing term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of threshold dynamics-type approximation schemes to propagating fronts evolving according to an anisotropic mean curvature motion in the presence of a forcing term depending on both time and position, thus generalizing the consistency result obtained in [Ishii-Pires-Souganidis, 1999] by extending the results obtained in [Caffarelli-Souganidis, 2010] for $\alpha \in [1,2)$ to anisotropic kernels and in the presence of a driving force. The limit geometric evolution is of a variational type and can be approximated, at a large scale, by eikonal-type equations modeling dislocations dynamics. We prove that it preserves convexity under suitable convexity assumptions on the forcing term and that convex evolutions of compact sets are unique. If the initial set is bounded and sufficiently large, and the driving force is constant, then the corresponding generalized front propagation is asymptotically similar to the Wulff shape.</description>

      <title>Near-Boundary Asymptotics and Unique Continuation for the AdS--Einstein--Maxwell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the results of both Shao and Holzegel-Shao to the AdS-Einstein-Maxwell system $({M}, g, F)$. We study the asymptotics of the metric $g$ and the Maxwell field $F$ near the conformal boundary ${I}$ for the fully nonlinear coupled system. Furthermore, we characterise the holographic (boundary) data used in the second part of this work.
  We also prove the local unique continuation property for solutions of the coupled Einstein equations from the conformal boundary. Specifically, the prescription of the coefficients $(\mathfrak{g}^{(0)}, \mathfrak{g}^{(n)})$ in the near-boundary expansion of $g$, along with the boundary data for the Maxwell fields $(\mathfrak{f}^{0}, \mathfrak{f}^{1})$, on a domain ${D} \subset {I}$ uniquely determines $(g, F)$ near ${D}$. The geometric conditions required for unique continuation are identical to those in the vacuum case, regardless of the presence of the Maxwell fields.
  This work is part of the author's thesis.</description>

Abstract: We address the global existence of solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise and with initial data in $H^{1/2}(\mathbb{T}^{3})$. We prove that the solution exists globally in time with probability arbitrarily close to~$1$ if the initial data and noise are sufficiently small. If the noise is not assumed to be small, then the solution is global on a sufficiently small deterministic time interval with probability arbitrarily close to~$1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stability of non-rotating viscous gaseous stars modeled by the Navier-Stokes-Poisson system. Under general assumptions on the equations of states, we proved that the number of unstable modes for the linearized Navier-Stokes-Poisson system equals that of the linearized Euler-Poisson system modeling inviscid gaseous stars. In particular, the turning point principle holds true for non-rotating stars with or without viscosity. That is, the transition of stability only occurs at the extrema of the total mass and the number of unstable modes is determined by the mass-radius curve. For the proof, we establish an infinite dimensional Kelvin-Tait-Chetaev theorem for a class of linear second order PDEs with dissipation. Moreover, we prove that linear stability implies nonlinear asymptotic stability and linear instability implies nonlinear instability for Navier-Stokes-Poisson system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the canonical Hilbert energy $H^{s/2}(M)$ on a Riemannian manifold for $s\in(0,2)$, with particular focus on the case of closed manifolds. Several equivalent definitions for this energy and the fractional Laplacian on a manifold are given, and they are shown to be identical up to explicit multiplicative constants. Moreover, the precise behavior of the kernel associated with the singular integral definition of the fractional Laplacian is obtained through an in-depth study of the heat kernel on a Riemannian manifold. Furthermore, a monotonicity formula for stationary points of functionals of the type $$ \mathcal E(v)=[v]^2_{H^{s/2}(M)}+\int_M F(v) \, dV \,, \,\,\, F \ge 0 \,, $$ is given, which includes, in particular, the case of nonlocal $s$-minimal surfaces. Finally, we prove some estimates for the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension problem, which are of general interest.
  This work is motivated by a recent article by the authors, which proves the nonlocal version of a conjecture of Yau.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability and dynamics of solitons in the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation with small multiplicative forcing. Forcing breaks the conservative structure of the KdV equation, leading to substantial changes in energy over long times. We show that, for small forcing, the inserted energy is almost fully absorbed by the soliton, resulting in a drastically changed amplitude and velocity. We decompose the solution to the forced equation into a modulated soliton and an infinite dimensional perturbation. Assuming slow exponential decay of the forcing, we show that the perturbation decays at the same exponential rate in a weighted Sobolev norm centered around the soliton.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for a volume-filling model of cell invasion into extracellular matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of weak solutions for a model of cell invasion into the extracellular matrix (ECM), which consists of a non-linear partial differential equation for the density of cells, coupled with an ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing the ECM density. The model contains cross-species density-dependent diffusion and proliferation terms that capture the role of the ECM in providing structural support for the cells during invasion while also preventing growth via volume-filling effects. Furthermore, the model includes ECM degradation by the cells. We present an existence result for weak solutions which is based on carefully exploiting the partial gradient flow structure of the problem which allows us to overcome the non-regularising nature of the ODE involved.
  In addition, we present simulations based on a finite difference scheme that illustrate that the system exhibits travelling wave solutions, and we investigate numerically the asymptotic behaviour as the ECM degradation rate tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness for the heat equation with density on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions to a class of heat equations with positive density posed on infinite weighted graphs. We separately consider the case when the density is bounded from below by a positive constant and the case of possibly vanishing density, showing that these two scenarios lead to two different classes of uniqueness.</description>

      <title>On bifurcation from infinity: a compactification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scalar parabolic partial differential equation on the interval with nonlinear boundary conditions that are asymptotically sublinear. As the parameter crosses critical values (e.g. the Steklov eigenvalues), it is known that there are large equilibria that arise through a bifurcation from infinity (i.e., such equilibria converge, after rescaling, to the Steklov eigenfunctions). We provide a compactification approach to the study of such unbounded bifurcation curves of equilibria, their stability, and heteroclinic orbits. In particular, we construct an induced semiflow at infinity such that the Steklov eigenfunctions are equilibria. Moreover, we prove the existence of infinite-time blow-up solutions that converge, after rescaling, to certain eigenfunctions that are equilibria of the induced semiflow at infinity.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for the defocusing 3d NLS in the exterior of a strictly convex obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and scattering theory for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $iu_t + \Delta_\Omega u = |u|^\alpha u$ in the exterior domain $\Omega$ of a smooth, compact and strictly convex obstacle in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is conjectured that in Euclidean space, if the solution has a prior bound in the critical Sobolev space, that is, $u \in L_t^\infty(I; \dot{H}_x^{s_c}(\mathbb{R}^3))$ with $s_c := \frac{3}{2} - \frac{2}{\alpha} \in (0, \frac{3}{2})$, then $u$ is global and scatters. In this paper, assuming that this conjecture holds, we prove that if $u$ is a solution to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in exterior domain $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary condition and satisfies $u \in L_t^\infty(I; \dot{H}^{s_c}_D(\Omega))$ with $s_c \in \left[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right)$, then $u$ is global and scatters.
  The proof of the main results relies on the concentration-compactness/rigidity argument of Kenig and Merle [Invent. Math. {\bf 166} (2006)]. The main difficulty is to construct minimal counterexamples when the scaling and translation invariance breakdown on $\Omega$. To achieve this, two key ingredients are required. First, we adopt the approach of Killip, Visan, and Zhang [Amer. J. Math. {\bf 138} (2016)] to derive the linear profile decomposition for the linear propagator $e^{it\Delta_\Omega}$ in $\dot{H}^{s_c}(\Omega)$. The second ingredient is the embedding of the nonlinear profiles. More precisely, we need to demonstrate that nonlinear solutions in the limiting geometries, which exhibit global spacetime bounds, can be embedded back into $\Omega$. Finally, to rule out the minimal counterexamples, we will establish long-time Strichartz estimates for the exterior domain NLS, along with spatially localized and frequency-localized Morawetz estimates.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of Lp-parabolicity and Lq-liouville property on weighted graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the $L^p$-parabolicity, the $L^q$-Liouville property for positive superharmonic functions, and the existence of nonharmonic positive solutions to the system
  \begin{align*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -\Delta u\geq 0,
  \Delta(|\Delta u|^{p-2}\Delta u)\geq 0,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{align*}
  on weighted graphs, where $1\leq p&lt; \infty$ and $(p, q)$ are H\"{o}lder conjugate exponent pair. Moreover, some new technique is developed to establish the estimate of green function under volume doubling and Poincar\'{e} inequality conditions, and the sharp volume growth conditions for the $L^p$-parabolicity can be derived on some graphs.</description>

      <title>Decay of large solutions around shocks to multi-D viscous conservation law with strictly convex flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a planar viscous shock for a scalar viscous conservation law with a strictly convex flux in multi-dimensional setting, where the transversal direction is periodic. We first show the contraction property for any solutions evolving from a large bounded initial perturbation in $L^2$ of the viscous shock. The contraction holds up to a dynamical shift, and it is measured by a weighted relative entropy. This result for the contraction extends the existing result in 1D \cite{Kang19} to the multi-dimensional case. As a consequence, if the large bounded initial $L^2$-perturbation is also in $L^1$, then the large perturbation decays of rate $t^{-1/4}$ in $L^2$, up to a dynamical shift that is uniformly bounded in time. This is the first result for the quantitative estimate converging to a planar shock under large perturbations.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical resolvent estimates for the magnetic Schr \"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain semiclassical resolvent estimates for the Schr{\"o}dinger operator (ih$\nabla$ + b)^2 + V in R^d , d $\ge$ 3, where  h  is a semiclassical parameter, V and b are real-valued electric and magnetic potentials independent of h.Under quite general assumptions, we prove that the norm of the weighted resolvent is bounded by exp(Ch^{-2} log(h^{ -1} )) . We get better resolvent bounds for electric potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the radial variable and magnetic potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the space variable. For long-range electric potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the radial variable and long-range magnetic potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the space variable we obtain a resolvent bound of the form exp(Ch^{-1}) .</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that the Sobolev inequality, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, the Schr\"odinger heat kernel upper bound, the Faber-Krahn inequality, the Nash inequality and the Rozenblum-Cwikel-Lieb inequality all equivalently exist on complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. We also obtain some integral gap theorems for compact shrinking Ricci solitons.</description>
