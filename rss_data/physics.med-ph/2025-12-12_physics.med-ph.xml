      <title>KRAS G12D protein screening for pancreatic cancer clinical trials using an AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical trials screening KRAS G12D protein for 30 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and 30 healthy donors were conducted utilizing an AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) biosensor. All resistance change ratios of PDAC patients are higher than the standard deviation above the mean resistance change ratio obtained from all healthy donors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HEMT biosensor and reveal its potential for early detection of pancreatic cancer with KRAS G12D protein screening.</description>

      <title>Event-sparse stack denoising for 4D-STEM applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a denoising method for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) that relies on processing local, scan position-independent electron event-sparse data stacks, called event-sparse stack denoising. This method adds an extra time dimension during data collection by recording multiple electron event-sparse diffraction patterns. The resulting datasets are effectively five-dimensional, referred to as locally time-resolved STEM (LTR-STEM). Diffraction data stacks at each scan position are processed using one of two sparsity denoising pipelines: 1) the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm followed by multi-step persistence thresholding, or 2) sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), followed by single-step thresholding. Both methods perform well for diffraction data denoising, as shown by simulated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) curves, denoised experimental data for virtual imaging, and application-specific denoising for defect detection. PSNR analysis indicates that sparsity-denoised 4D-STEM data reaches the same PSNR as raw data at approximately 16% of the exposure time, demonstrating comparable image quality with a lower dose. In defect detection, a 4.1x increase in sensitivity to relative radial disk shift is observed in the denoised data. Moreover, the LTR-STEM technique may be used to inspect material degradation by tracking changes in diffraction disk intensity, allowing for critical dose estimation and exposure-selective imaging.</description>

      <title>PMB-NN: Physiology-Centred Hybrid AI for Personalized Hemodynamic Monitoring from Photoplethysmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and hemodynamic parameters such as peripheral resistance (R) and arterial compliance (C) are critical for early vascular dysfunction detection. While photoplethysmography (PPG) wearables has gained popularity, existing data-driven methods for BP estimation lack interpretability. We advanced our previously proposed physiology-centered hybrid AI method-Physiological Model-Based Neural Network (PMB-NN)-in blood pressure estimation, that unifies deep learning with a 2-element Windkessel based model parameterized by R and C acting as physics constraints. The PMB-NN model was trained in a subject-specific manner using PPG-derived timing features, while demographic information was used to infer an intermediate variable: cardiac output. We validated the model on 10 healthy adults performing static and cycling activities across two days for model's day-to-day robustness, benchmarked against deep learning (DL) models (FCNN, CNN-LSTM, Transformer) and standalone Windkessel based physiological model (PM). Validation was conducted on three perspectives: accuracy, interpretability and plausibility. PMB-NN achieved systolic BP accuracy (MAE: 7.2 mmHg) comparable to DL benchmarks, diastolic performance (MAE: 3.9 mmHg) lower than DL models. However, PMB-NN exhibited higher physiological plausibility than both DL baselines and PM, suggesting that the hybrid architecture unifies and enhances the respective merits of physiological principles and data-driven techniques. Beyond BP, PMB-NN identified R (ME: 0.15 mmHg$\cdot$s/ml) and C (ME: -0.35 ml/mmHg) during training with accuracy similar to PM, demonstrating that the embedded physiological constraints confer interpretability to the hybrid AI framework. These results position PMB-NN as a balanced, physiologically grounded alternative to purely data-driven approaches for daily hemodynamic monitoring.</description>

      <title>Fast generation of 3D flow obstacles from parametric surface models: application to cardiac valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the computationally demanding nature of fluid-structure interaction simulations, heart valve simulation is a complex task. A simpler alternative is to model the valve as a resistive flow obstacle that can be updated dynamically without altering the mesh, but this approach can also become computationally expensive for large meshes.
  In this work, we present a fast method for computing the resistive flow obstacle of a heart valve. The method is based on a parametric surface model of the valve, which is defined by a set of curves. The curves are adaptively sampled to create a polyline representation, which is then used to generate the surface. The surface is represented as a set of points, allowing for efficient distance calculations to determine whether mesh nodes belong to the valve surface. We introduce three algorithms for computing these distances: minimization, sampling, and triangulation. Additionally, we implement two mesh traversal strategies: exhaustive node iteration and recursive neighbor search. The latter significantly reduces the number of distance calculations by only considering neighboring nodes.
  Our pipeline is demonstrated on both a previously reported aortic valve model and a newly proposed mitral valve model, highlighting its flexibility and efficiency for rapid valve shape updates in computational simulations.</description>

      <title>Composition-Dependent Properties of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ Nanopowders Tailored for X-Ray Photodynamic Therapy and Cathodoluminescence Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.</description>
