      <title>Holomorphic projective connections on surfaces and osculating spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study complex analytic projective connections on surfaces in projective n-spaces in terms of the "second" neighborhood of the surface in the ambient space, and in terms of the osculating behavior of the integral curves. We also investigate the action of a remarkable rational transformation on projective connections, and give the geometrical interpretation of joint invariants of a group closely related to the study of equivalence classes of projective connections on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Bi-flat F-structures as differential bicomplexes and Gauss-Manin connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a bi-flat F-structure $(\nabla,\circ,e,\nabla^*,*,E)$ on a manifold $M$ defines a differential bicomplex $(d_{\nabla},d_{E\circ\nabla^*})$ on forms with value on the tangent sheaf of the manifold. Moreover, the sequence of vector fields defined recursively by $d_{\nabla}X_{(\alpha+1)}=d_{L\nabla^*}X_{(\alpha)}$ coincide with the coefficients of the formal expansion of the flat local sections of a family of flat connections $\nabla^{GM}$ associated with the bi-flat structure. In the case of Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold the connection $\nabla^{GM}$ (for suitable choice of an auxiliary parameter) can be identified with the Levi-Civita connection of the flat pencil of metrics defined by the invariant metric and the intesection form.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-uniqueness of cone spherical metrics with prescribed singularities on a compact Riemann surface with positive genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone spherical metrics, defined on compact Riemann surfaces, are conformal metrics with constant curvature one and finitely many cone singularities. Such a metric is termed \textit{reducible} if a developing map of the metric has monodromy in ${\rm U(1)}$, and \textit{irreducible} otherwise. Utilizing the polystable extensions of two line bundles on a compact Riemann surface $X$ with genus $g_X&gt;0$, we establish the following three primary results concerning these metrics with cone angles in $2\pi{\mathbb Z}_{&gt;1}$:
  \begin{itemize} \item[(1)] Given an effective divisor $D$ with an odd degree surpassing $2g_X$ on $X$, we find the existence of an effective divisor $D'$ in the complete linear system $|D|$ that can be represented by at least two distinct irreducible cone spherical metrics on $X$.
  \item[(2)] For a generic effective divisor $D$ with an even degree and $\deg D\geq 6g_X-2$ on $X$, we can identify an arcwise connected Borel subset in $|D|$ that demonstrates a Hausdorff dimension of no less than $\big(\deg D-4g_{X}+2\big)$. Within this subset, each divisor $D'$ can be distinctly represented by a family of reducible metrics, defined by a single real parameter.
  \item[(3)] For an effective divisor $D$ with $\deg D=2$ on an elliptic curve, we can identify a Borel subset in $|D|$ that is arcwise connected, showcasing a Hausdorff dimension of one. Within this subset, each divisor $D'$ can be distinctly represented by a family of reducible metrics, defined by a single real parameter.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{CMC\text{-}1}$ surfaces in hyperbolic and de Sitter spaces with Cantor ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that on every compact Riemann surface $M$ there is a Cantor set $C \subset M$ such that $M \setminus C$ admits a proper conformal constant mean curvature one ($\mathrm{CMC\text{-}1}$) immersion into hyperbolic $3$-space $\mathbb{H}^3$. Moreover, we obtain that every bordered Riemann surface admits an almost proper $\mathrm{CMC\text{-}1}$ face into de Sitter $3$-space $\mathbb{S}_1^3$, and we show that on every compact Riemann surface $M$ there is a Cantor set $C \subset M$ such that $M \setminus C$ admits an almost proper $\mathrm{CMC\text{-}1}$ face into $\mathbb{S}_1^3$. These results follow from different uniform approximation theorems for holomorphic null curves in $\mathbb{C}^2 \times \mathbb{C}^*$ that we also establish in this paper.</description>

      <title>Classification of translation surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study translation surfaces in the Euclidean space endowed with a canonical semi-symmetric non-metric connection. We completely classify the translation surfaces of constant sectional curvature with respect to this connection, proving that they are generalized cylinders. This consequence is the same as in the case of the Levi-Civita connection, but in this new setting, there are also generalized cylinders whose sectional curvature can be constant or non-constant, in contrast to the Levi-Civita connection, where the Gaussian curvature is zero.</description>

      <title>Hodge-de Rham and Lichn\'erowicz Laplacians on double forms and some vanishing theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(p,q)$-double form on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ can be considered simultaneously as a vector-valued differential $p$-form over $M$ or alternatively as a vector-valued $q$-form. Accordingly, the usual Hodge-de Rham Laplacian on differential forms can be extended to double forms in two ways. The differential operators obtained in this way are denoted by $\Delta$ and $\widetilde{\Delta}$.\\ In this paper, we show that the Lichn\'erowicz Laplacian $\Delta_L$ once operating on double forms, is nothing but the average of the two operators mentioned above. We introduce a new product on double forms to establish index-free formulas for the curvature terms in the Weitzenb\"ock formulas corresponding to the Laplacians $\Delta, \widetilde{\Delta}$ and $\Delta_L$. We prove vanishing theorems for the Hodge-de Rham Laplacian $\Delta$ on $(p,0)$ double forms and for $\Delta_L$ and $\Delta$ on symmetric double forms of arbitrary order. These results generalize recent results by Petersen-Wink. Our vanishing theorems reveal the impact of the role played by the rank of the eigenvectors of the curvature operator on the structure (e.g. the topology) of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Constant sectional curvature surfaces with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ endowed with a canonical semi-symmetric non-metric connection determined by a vector field $\mathsf{C}\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. We study surfaces when the sectional curvature with respect to this connection is constant. In case that the surface is cylindrical, we obtain full classification when the rulings are orthogonal or parallel to $\mathsf{C}$. If the surface is rotational, we prove that the rotation axis is parallel to $\mathsf{C}$ and we classify all conical rotational surfaces with constant sectional curvature. Finally, for the particular case $\frac12$ of the sectional curvature, the existence of rotational surfaces orthogonally intersecting the rotation axis is also obtained.</description>

Abstract: We describe a general correspondence between weighted minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and weighted maximal surfaces with some admissible singularities in $\mathbb{L}^3$, for a class of functions $\varphi$ which provides the corresponding weight. For these families of surfaces, we provide a Weierstrass representation when $\dot{\varphi}\neq 0$ and analyze in detail the asymptotic behavior of both such a weighted maximal surface around its singular set and its corresponding weighted minimal immersion around the nodal set of its angle function, establishing criteria that allow us to easily determine the type of singularity and classify the associated moduli spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $\s^1$ be a circle in Euclidean plane. We consider the problem of finding the shape of a planar curve which is an extremal of the potential energy that measures the distance to $\s^1$. We describe the shape of these curves distinguishing if the curves lie in the inside or outside of $\s^1$. We extend the problem for energies that are powers to the distance to $\s^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the non-compactness of moduli space of solutions of the monopole equations for $3/2$-spinors on a closed 3-manifold is equivalent to the existence of `3/2-Fueter sections' that are solutions of an overdetermined non-linear elliptic differential equation. These are sections of a fiber bundle whose fiber is a special 4-dimensional submanifold of the hyperk\"ahler manifold of center-framed charged one $SU(2)$-instantons on $\mathbf{R}^4$. This fiber bundle does not inherit a hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

Abstract: We study Ricci-flat perturbations of gravitational instantons of Petrov type D. Analogously to the Lorentzian case, the Weyl curvature scalars of extreme spin-weight satisfy a Riemannian version of the separable Teukolsky equation. As a step towards rigidity of the type D Kerr and Taub-bolt families of instantons, we prove mode stability, i.e., that the Teukolsky equation admits no solutions compatible with regularity and asymptotic (local) flatness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the local geometry of a pair of independent contact structures on 3-manifolds under maps that independently preserve each contact structure. We discover that such maps are homotheties on the contact 1-forms and we discover differential invariants associated to such structures under these equivalences. This allows us to generalize the notion of contact circles and (equilateral) hyperbolas to contact ellipses and hyperbolas. Moreover, these invariants may sometimes be used to define a complete local normal form and in at least one case are related to symplectic structures through a natural $e$-structure on a bundle arising from the Cartan equivalence method. Finally, there is a type of natural Riemannian metric (but not necessarily the well-known associated contact metric) and we discover certain curvatures may be written in terms of the bi-contact differential invariants.</description>

Moreover, the regular set of such a tangent cone in the metric sense coincides with the regular set in the algebraic sense. Along the way, we give a parabolic proof of H\"ormander's $L^{2}$ estimate, which can be used to solve the $\overline{\partial}$-equation on any singular shrinking K\"ahler-Ricci soliton.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the mean curvature of leaves of CMC foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a foliation by CMC hypersurfaces on a complete Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with sectional curvature bounded from below by $-nK_0\leq 0$ and such that the mean curvature $H$ of the leaves of the foliation satisfies $|H|\geq \sqrt{K_0}$, under certain additional hypotheses, for instance, if $M$ is a compact (without boundary) or if ${\rm div} (\nabla_N N)=0$ where the gradient of the function ${\rm div} (N)$ is non zero, then we prove that $|H|\equiv \sqrt{K_0}$, where $N$ is a unit vector field orthogonal to the foliation. Moreover, in the the case that $M$ is compact, we prove also that all the leaves are totally umbilical. This gives, in particular, a generalization for the result proved by Barbosa, Kenmotsu and Oshikiri (1991), where was proved the above result in the case $K_0=0$ and $M$ compact. Under the same additional hypotheses as above, we obtain that for a foliation by CMC hypersurfaces on a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with Ricci curvature bounded from below by $-nK_0\leq 0$, the mean curvature $H$ of the leaves of the foliation satisfies $|H|\leq \sqrt{K_0}$. This gives a positive partial answer to a conjecture due to Meeks III, P\'erez and Ros. We also provide some partial answers to several other problems.</description>

      <title>Estimates of K\"ahler metrics on noncompact finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surfaces, and their symmetric products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ denote a noncompact finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surface of genus $g\geq 2$, with only one puncture at $i\infty$ (identifying $X$ with its universal cover $\mathbb{H}$). Let $\overline{X}:=X\cup\lbrace i\infty\rbrace$ denote the Satake compactification of $X$. Let $\Omega_{\overline{X}}$ denote the cotangent bundle on $\overline{X}$. For $k\gg1$, we derive an estimate for $\mu_{\overline{X}}^{\mathrm{Ber},k}$, the Bergman metric associated to the line bundle $\mathcal{L}^{k}:=\Omega_{\overline{X}}\otimes \mathcal{O}_{\overline{X}}\big((k-1)\infty\big)$.
  For a given $d\geq 1$, the pull-back of the Fubini-Study metric on the Grassmannian, which we denote by $\mu_{\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X})}^{\mathrm{FS},k}$, defines a K\"ahler metric on $\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X})$, the $d$-fold symmetric product of $\overline{X}$. Using our estimates of $\mu_{\overline{X}}^{\mathrm{Ber},k}$, as an application, we derive an estimate for $\mu_{\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X}),\mathrm{vol}}^{\mathrm{FS},k}$, the volume form associated to the (1,1)-form $\mu_{\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X})}^{\mathrm{FS},k}$.</description>
