      <title>Machine Learns Quantum Complexity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a machine based on deep learning algorithms learns Krylov spread complexity in quantum systems with N x N random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. Using thermofield double states as initial conditions, we demonstrate that a convolutional neural network-based algorithm successfully learns the Krylov spread complexity across all timescales, including the late-time plateaus where states appear nearly featureless and random. Performance strongly depends on the basis choice, performing well with the energy eigenbasis or the Krylov basis but failing in the original basis of the random Hamiltonian. The algorithm also effectively distinguishes temperature-dependent features of thermofield double states. Furthermore, we show that the system time variable of state predicted by deep learning is an irrelevant quantity, reinforcing that the Krylov spread complexity well captures the essential features of the quantum state, even at late times.</description>

      <title>Relational bundle geometric formulation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bundle geometric formulation of non-relativistic many-particles Quantum Mechanics. A wave function is seen to be a $\mathbb{C}$-valued cocyclic tensorial 0-form on configuration space-time seen as a principal bundle, while the Schr\"odinger equation flows from its covariant derivative, with the action functional supplying a (flat) cocyclic connection 1-form on the configuration bundle. In line with the historical motivations of Dirac and Feynman, ours is thus a Lagrangian geometric formulation of QM, in which the Dirac-Feynman path integral arises in a geometrically natural way.
  Applying the dressing field method, we obtain a relational reformulation of this geometric non-relativistic QM: a relational wave function is realised as a basic cocyclic 0-form on the configuration bundle. In this relational QM, any particle position can be used as a dressing field, i.e. as a "physical reference frame". The dressing field method naturally accounts for the freedom in choosing the dressing field, which is readily understood as a covariance of the relational formulation under changes of physical reference frame.</description>

      <title>Equalities and inequalities from entanglement, loss, and beam splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optics bridges esoteric notions of entanglement and superposition with practical applications like metrology and communication. Throughout, there is an interplay between information theoretic concepts such as entropy and physical considerations such as quantum system design, noise, and loss. Therefore, a fundamental result at the heart of these fields has numerous ramifications in development of applications and advancing our understanding of quantum physics. Our recent proof for the entanglement properties of states interfering with the vacuum on a beam splitter led to monotonicity and convexity properties for quantum states undergoing photon loss [Lupu-Gladstein et al., arXiv:2411.03423 (2024)] by breathing life into a decades-old conjecture. In this work, we extend these fundamental properties to measures of similarity between states, provide inequalities for creation and annihilation operators beyond the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, prove a conjecture [Hertz et al., PRA 110, 012408 (2024)] dictating that nonclassicality through the quadrature coherence scale is uncertifiable beyond a loss of 50%, and place constraints on quasiprobability distributions of all physical states. These ideas can now circulate afresh throughout quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-assisted reverse annealing on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing has garnered significant attention as meta-heuristics inspired by quantum physics for combinatorial optimization problems. Among its many applications, nonnegative/binary matrix factorization stands out for its complexity and relevance in unsupervised machine learning. The use of reverse annealing, a derivative procedure of quantum annealing to prioritize the search in a vicinity under a given initial state, helps improve its optimization performance in matrix factorization. This study proposes an improved strategy that integrates reverse annealing with a linear programming relaxation technique. Using relaxed solutions as the initial configuration for reverse annealing, we demonstrate improvements in optimization performance comparable to the exact optimization methods. Our experiments on facial image datasets show that our method provides better convergence than known reverse annealing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of relaxation-based initialization methods on randomized datasets, demonstrating a relationship between the relaxed solution and the optimal solution. This research underscores the potential of combining reverse annealing and classical optimization strategies to enhance optimization performance.</description>

      <title>Snakes on a Plane: mobile, low dimensional logical qubits on a 2D surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations indicate that silicon-spin QPUs will be able to shuttle physical qubits rapidly and with high fidelity - a desirable feature for maximising logical connectivity, supporting new codes, and routing around damage. However it may seem that shuttling at the logical level is unwise: static defects in the device may 'scratch' a logical qubit as it passes, causing correlated errors to which the code is highly vulnerable. Here we explore an architecture where logical qubits are 1D strings ('snakes') which can be moved freely over a planar latticework. Possible scratch events are inferred via monitor qubits and the complimentary gap; if deemed a risk, remarkably the shuttle process can be undone in a way that negates any corruption. Interaction between logical snakes is facilitated by a semi-transversal method. We obtain encouraging estimates for the tolerable levels of shuttling-related imperfections.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Unitarity Violation and Quantum State Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central foundational problems in quantum mechanics is the inability of Schr\"odinger's unitary time evolution to describe measurement of a quantum state. Recent developments in models of spontaneous unitarity violation (SUV) propose that quantum state reduction can emerge as a thermodynamic phenomenon, offering a natural resolution to the measurement problem. This paper investigates the philosophical implications of SUV in relation to the nature of probabilities in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. It provides an alternate interpretation of probabilities in quantum mechanics that aligns with (and improves upon) the arguments of the propensity interpretation of probabilities.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Method for Doppler Averaging of Rydberg EIT Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the effect of Doppler broadening due to the thermal atomic motion of Rydberg sensors typically relies on sampling a large velocity class, solving the equations of motion for each velocity, and then averaging the atomic density matrix over that velocity class. This process is inexact, slow, and presents a bottleneck in simulating Rydberg sensors. We present an approach that allows for fast, exact velocity averaging just by solving the equations of motion twice. We find the "propagator" that acts on the zero-velocity solution to generate the velocity-dependent atomic state for all velocities. By averaging this propagator over the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution of the atoms, we obtain an explicit, analytic formula that generates the averaged atomic state. This method is expected to save memory and time computational resources by one to several orders of magnitude, compared to traditional sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>Bit-bit encoding, optimizer-free training and sub-net initialization: techniques for scalable quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning for classical data is currently perceived to have a scalability problem due to (i) a bottleneck at the point of loading data into quantum states, (ii) the lack of clarity around good optimization strategies, and (iii) barren plateaus that occur when the model parameters are randomly initialized. In this work, we propose techniques to address all of these issues. First, we present a quantum classifier that encodes both the input and the output as binary strings which results in a model that has no restrictions on expressivity over the encoded data but requires fast classical compression of typical high-dimensional datasets to only the most predictive degrees of freedom. Second, we show that if one parameter is updated at a time, variational quantum circuits can be trained without using a classical optimizer in a way that guarantees convergence to a local minimum, something not possible for classical deep learning models. Third, we propose a parameter initialization strategy called sub-net initialization to avoid barren plateaus where smaller models, trained on more compactly encoded data with fewer qubits, are used to initialize models that utilize more qubits. Along with theoretical arguments on efficacy, we demonstrate the combined performance of these methods on subsets of the MNIST dataset for models with an all-to-all connected architecture that use up to 16 qubits in simulation. This allows us to conclude that the loss function consistently decreases as the capability of the model, measured by the number of parameters and qubits, increases, and this behavior is maintained for datasets of varying complexity. Together, these techniques offer a coherent framework for scalable quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>A Toffoli Gate Decomposition via Echoed Cross-Resonance Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has garnered significant interest for its potential to solve certain computational problems much faster than the best-known classical algorithms. A fully functional and scalable quantum computer could transform various fields such as scientific research, material science, chemistry, and drug discovery. However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum hardware faces challenges including decoherence, gate infidelity, and restricted qubit connectivity. Efficient implementation of multi-qubit gates is critical to advancing quantum computing, especially given the constraints of near-term quantum hardware, such as the absence of all-to-all qubit connectivity. Among these gates, the Toffoli gate (or CCNOT gate) plays a pivotal role in a wide range of quantum algorithms and error correction schemes. While various decomposition strategies have been proposed, they often assume idealized all-to-all connectivity, which is not available on most NISQ hardware. This paper introduces a novel decomposition of the Toffoli gate using Echoed Cross-Resonance (ECR) gates, a native operation for many superconducting qubit architectures, including IBM Quantum's hardware. By leveraging the inherent compatibility of ECR gates with superconducting qubit technology, this approach is intended to facilitate the implementation of the Toffoli gate, potentially reducing circuit depth and enhancing the efficiency of quantum circuits implementations on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Atom-by-Atom Assembly of Defect-Free Two-Dimensional Mixed-Species Atomic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect-free single atom array in optical tweezers is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. Extending single-species array to mixed-species one promise to offer new possibilities. In our recent proof of principle realization of defect-free two-dimensional assembly of mixed-species $^{85}$Rb ($^{87}$Rb) atom arrays [C. Sheng et al.\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.083202}{{\color{blue} Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 083202(2022)}}], the filling fractions were limited by the imperfect transfer of atoms and the occurrence of logjams during the atom rearrangement. In order to scale up the size of defect-free mixed-species atom array, we scale up the tweezer array and improve the atom transfer, and upgrade the heuristic heteronuclear algorithm so as to facilitate multiple rearrangement cycles. Consequently, we successfully create defect-free atom arrays with 120 mixed-species single atoms. The corresponding filling fraction and defect-free probability are improved to be 98.6(1)\% and 14(2)\%, respectively. It is anticipated that the enhanced algorithm can be extended to other combinations of atomic species, and this mixed-species atom array is readily for studies of many-body physics, quantum error correction, and quantum metrology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier transition is one of the major factors hindering the high-speed implementation of M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates in trapped-ion quantum processors. We present an approach to design laser pulse shapes for M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate in ion chains which accounts for the effect of carrier transition on qubit-phonon dynamics. We show that the fast-oscillating carrier term effectively modifies the spin-dependent forces acting on ions, and this can be compensated by a simple nonlinear transformation of a laser pulse. Using numerical simulations for short ion chains and perturbation theory for longer chains, we demonstrate that our approach allows to reach the infidelity below $10^{-4}$ while keeping the gate duration below 100 $\mu$s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguides on a chip represent a new medium for implementing nonlinear optical transformations of light. The capabilities of waveguides for generating sub-Poissonian light in the form of a displaced Kerr state are analyzed. We offer analytical formulas for estimating the ultimate capabilities of suppressing photon fluctuations of a displaced Kerr state for any value of input light amplitude. The results of numerical calculations are presented. It is shown that the degree of photon noise suppression can reach values of 5 - 15 dB with 100 mW light power in waveguides a few meters long.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering in hybrid magnetic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of magnonics has facilitated the utilization of hybrid magnetic systems in quantum technologies. A hybrid magnetic lattice (HML), comprising an array of superconducting loops and magnetic particles, has been devised as a quantum bus to disseminate quantum resources among magnetic quantum entities (MQEs) serving as nodes of a quantum network. However, the HML also exerts a decoherence effect on the MQEs, which has the potential to impair its practical performance. By studying the non-Markovian dynamics of two MQEs comprised of either nitrogen-vacancy centers or magnon modes coupled to two independent HMLs, we propose a Floquet-engineering scheme by applying periodic driving on the MQEs to overcome the unwanted effect. It is revealed that the decoherence can be suppressed and a significant degree of entanglement can be maintained in the steady state, provided that a FBS exists within the quasienergy spectrum of the total system of each periodically driven MQE and its HML. This result enhances our ability to control hybrid magnetic systems and is beneficial for the application of HML in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade in Cavity Magnomechanical Systems using Phase-Controlled Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we optimize photon blockade in a cavity magnomechanical system using feedback by introducing optimized values for the phase and magnetic field coupling strength at each drive frequency. It is shown that the computed values significantly reduce the photon second-order correlation function in the dynamic Schrodinger equation. The Radau method, an implicit Runge-Kutta method, has been employed, which provides more accurate results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a frequency detuning between the magnon and photon can result in deep values of photon blockade. Utilizing these optimized parameters outperforms scenarios that rely on constant, non-optimized values. This approach provides strong potential for applications in quantum sensing and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in time-dependent media and cosmic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spatially uniform, but time-dependent dielectric media with equal electric and magnetic response, classical electromagnetic waves propagate exactly like in empty, flat space with transformed time, called conformal time, and so do quantum fluctuations. In empty, flat space the renormalized vacuum energy is exactly zero, but not in time-dependent media, as we show in this paper. This is because renormalization is local and causal, and so cannot compensate fully for the transformation to conformal time. The expanding universe appears as such a medium to the electromagnetic field. We show that the vacuum energy during cosmic expansion effectively reduces the weights of radiation and matter by characteristic factors. This quantum buoyancy naturally resolves the Hubble tension, the discrepancy between the measured and the inferred Hubble constant, and it might resolve other cosmological tensions as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum photonics have driven significant progress in photonic quantum computing (PQC), addressing challenges in scalability, efficiency, and fault tolerance. Experimental efforts have focused on integrated photonic platforms utilizing materials such as silicon photonics and lithium niobate to enhance performance. Parameters like photon loss rates, coupling efficiencies, and fidelities have been pivotal, with state-of-the-art systems achieving coupling efficiencies above 90% and photon indistinguishability exceeding 99%. Quantum error correction schemes have reduced logical error rates to below $10^{-3}$, marking a step toward fault-tolerant PQC. Photon generation has also advanced with deterministic sources, such as quantum dots, achieving brightness levels exceeding $10^6$ photon pairs/s/mW and time-bin encoding enabling scalable entanglement. Heralded single-photon sources now exhibit purities above 99%, driven by innovations in fabrication techniques. High-efficiency photon detectors, such as superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), have demonstrated detection efficiencies exceeding 98%, dark count rates below 1 Hz, and timing jitters as low as 15 ps, ensuring precise photon counting and manipulation. Moreover, demonstrations of boson sampling with over 100 photons underscore the growing computational power of photonic systems, surpassing classical limits. The integration of machine learning has optimized photonic circuit design, while frequency multiplexing and time-bin encoding have increased system scalability. Together, these advances bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical implementation, positioning PQC as a transformative technology for computing, communication, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Carleman-lattice-Boltzmann quantum circuit with matrix access oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Carleman linearization of the Lattice Boltzmann (CLB) representation of fluid flows to quantum emulate the dynamics of a 2D Kolmogorov-like flow. We assess the accuracy of the result and find a relative error of the order of $10^{-3}$ with just two Carleman iterates, for a range of the Reynolds number up to a few hundreds. We first define a gate-based quantum circuit for the implementation of the CLB method and then exploit the sparse nature of the CLB matrix to build a quantum circuit based on block-encoding techniques which makes use of matrix oracles. It is shown that the gate complexity of the algorithm is thereby dramatically reduced, from exponential to quadratic. However, due to the need of employing up to seven ancilla qubits, the probability of success of the corresponding circuit for a single time step is too low to enable multi-step time evolution. Several possible directions to circumvent this problem are briefly outlined.</description>

      <title>Quest for quantum advantage: Monte Carlo wave-function simulations of the Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) is a quantum network of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) intended to find ground states of the Ising model. This is an NP-hard problem, related to several important minimization problems, including the max-cut graph problem, and many similar problems. In order to enhance its potential performance, we analyze the coherent coupling strategy for the CIM in a highly quantum regime. To explore this limit we employ accurate numerical simulations. Due to the inherent complexity of the system, the maximum network size is limited. While master equation methods can be used, their scalability diminishes rapidly for larger systems. Instead, we use Monte Carlo wave-function methods, which scale as the wave-function dimension, and use large numbers of samples. These simulations involve Hilbert spaces exceeding $10^{7}$ dimensions. To evaluate success probabilities, we use quadrature probabilities. We demonstrate the potential for quantum computational advantage through improved simulation times and success rates in a low-dissipation regime, by using quantum superpositions and time varying couplings to give enhanced quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Machine Learning via Heat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach rooted in quantum thermodynamics to enhance sampling efficiency in quantum machine learning (QML). We propose conceptualizing quantum supervised learning as a thermodynamic cooling process. Building on this concept, we develop a quantum refrigerator protocol that enhances sample efficiency during training and prediction without the need for Grover iterations or quantum phase estimation. Inspired by heat-bath algorithmic cooling protocols, our method alternates entropy compression and thermalization steps to decrease the entropy of qubits, increasing polarization towards the dominant bias. This technique minimizes the computational overhead associated with estimating classification scores and gradients, presenting a practical and efficient solution for QML algorithms compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Controllable superradiance scaling in photonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superradiance of two-level target atoms (TAs) coupled to a photonic waveguide, demonstrating that the scaling of the superradiance strength can be controlled on demand by an ensemble of control atoms (CAs). The scaling with respect to the number of TAs can be lower, higher, or equal to the traditional Dicke superradiance, depending on the relative positioning of the ensembles and the type of CAs (e.g., small or giant). These phenomena are attributed to unconventional atomic correlations. Furthermore, we observe chiral superradiance of the TAs, where the degree of chirality can be enhanced by giant CAs instead of small ones. The effects discussed in this work could be observed in waveguide QED experiments, offering a potential avenue for manipulating superradiance.</description>

      <title>Resonance fluorescence spectra of a driven Kerr nonlinear resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence spectra of a driven Kerr nonlinear resonator is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. When the Kerr nonlinear resonator is driven strongly such that the induced Rabi frequency is comparable to or larger than the Kerr nonlinearity, the system cannot be approximated as a two-level system. We theoretically derive characteristic features in the fluorescence spectra such as the decrease of the center-peak intensity and the asymmetric sideband peaks in the presence of finite dephasing. Those features are consistently explained by the population of the initial dressed state and its transition matrix element to the final dressed state of the transition corresponding to each peak. Finally, we experimentally measure the resonance fluorescence spectra of a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear resonator and find a quantitative agreement with our theory.</description>

      <title>Robust M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen Gate Against Symmetric and Asymmetric Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve the entangling gate fidelity above the quantum error correction threshold, it is critical to suppress errors due to experimental imperfection. We consider the M\o lmer-S\o rensen gates in trapped-ion systems, and develop a general approach to suppress a family of noise sources that appeared as either symmetric or asymmetric errors. Using the time-average displacement minimization technique, both symmetric error and displacement-dependent part of the asymmetric errors are eliminated. Then, by analyzing the tangent space of displacement-independent errors, we obtain the analytic form of the generators of the correction operator to the remaining error terms. We then develop a compensation pulse to fully suppress the remaining displacement-independent errors. The effectiveness of our scheme is further verified by numerical analysis, through which we observe a significant reduction of entangling gate infidelity. Our findings enhance gate fidelity and robustness to noise for ion trap quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Tightening the entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory in a multipartite scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum uncertainty principle stands as a cornerstone and a distinctive feature of quantum mechanics, setting it apart from classical mechanics. We introduce a tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation, and extend the relation to encompass multiple measurements conducted within multipartite systems. The related lower bounds are shown to be tighter than those formulated by Zhang et al. [Phys. Rev. A 108, 012211 (2023)]. Additionally, we present generalized quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations (QMA-EURs) tailored for arbitrary positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs). Finally, we demonstrate the applications of our results to both the relative entropy of unilateral coherence and the quantum key distribution protocols.</description>

      <title>QSCL-EWIL: Quantum Stochastic Contrast Learning for Enhanced WiFi-Based Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based indoor localization is essential for asset tracking, healthcare monitoring, and smart buildings. However, existing systems face challenges such as data variability, environmental noise, and difficulty detecting floor and building levels, compounded by limited labeled data and high received signal strength (RSS) collection costs. This paper introduces quantum stochastic contrast learning (QSCL), a novel framework grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations. We present four theorems and one lemma that establish the probabilistic augmentation, diversity enhancement, relationship preservation, and resilience of QSCL under quantum noise, supported by formal proofs. Leveraging these foundations, QSCL utilizes quantum computing (QC) to generate strong data augmentations with stochastic perturbations, enhancing data diversity, while classical weak augmentations provide subtle variations for robust feature learning. We propose a spatial temporal adaptive attention (STAA) encoder that integrates convolutional layers with adaptive attention mechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data. Furthermore, a bidirectional contrastive loss function is introduced to capture forward and reverse relationships between augmented views, ensuring robust representations. Comprehensive evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc datasets validate QSCL, demonstrating superior performance with reduced labeled data and resilience to quantum noise such as bit-flip, dephasing, and measurement noise. The proposed framework significantly improves localization accuracy, floor and building detection, and generalizability in challenging indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Reducing Circuit Depth in Quantum State Preparation for Quantum Simulation Using Measurements and Feedforward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing circuit depth and identifying an optimal trade-off between circuit depth and width is crucial for successful quantum computation. In this context, mid-circuit measurement and feedforward have been shown to significantly reduce the depth of quantum circuits, particularly in implementing logical gates. By leveraging these techniques, we propose several parallelization strategies that reduce quantum circuit depth at the expense of increasing width in preparing various quantum states relevant to quantum simulation. With measurements and feedforward, we demonstrate that utilizing unary encoding as a bridge between two quantum states substantially reduces the circuit depth required for preparing quantum states, such as sparse quantum states and sums of Slater determinants within the first quantization framework, while maintaining an efficient circuit width. Additionally, we show that a coordinate Bethe ansatz, characterized by its high degree of freedom in its phase, can be probabilistically prepared in a constant-depth quantum circuit using measurements and feedforward. We anticipate that our study will contribute to the reduction of circuit depth in initial state preparation, particularly for quantum simulation, which is a critical step toward achieving quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Strongly correlated polaritons are necessary for entering the quantum photonic regime with many applications. We simulate exciton-polariton condensation using the finite-difference and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods with the strongly correlated polariton condition incorporated in the mean-field equations and analyze the polariton dynamics. This is done for coherent, near-resonant pumping as well as homogeneous, incoherent, non-resonant pumping. We find conditions akin to the polariton blockade in the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum system exhibits unique advantages over the qubit system in some quantum information processing tasks. We present a program for implementing deterministic bidirectional controlled remote quantum state preparation (BCRSP) in arbitrary $N$-dimensional (quNit) system. By introducing two generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as quantum channels, two communication parties can simultaneously prepare a single-particle high-dimensional state at each other's site under the control of Charlie. Compared with the previous counterparts, the significant advantage of our scheme is that the high-dimensional CNOT operations are not required. Moreover, the performance our scheme are evaluated. The evaluation of the performance shows that if the quNit is encoded in the spatial mode of single photons, our scheme can be accomplished solely using only linear optical elements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of nearly monochromatic light propagation through a gas of two-level atoms using the Heisenberg-Langevin equation method. Our focus is on the evolution of the photon annihilation operator and its impact on the second-order correlation function, $g^{(2)}({\tau})$, with particular emphasis on photon antibunching behavior. The model accounts for both open and closed atomic system approximations, including Doppler broadening and the influence of pump field detuning. We derive expressions that reproduce known results from scattering theory and extend the analysis to complex systems, such as inhomogeneously broadened media. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data from a waveguide QED platform, which show good agreement and thereby demonstrate the power of our approach. Future work will explore extensions to even more complex systems and other quantum light characteristics for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting Electromagnetically Induced Transparency based Cold Atomic Engines using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an artificial neural network model to predict quantum heat engines working within the experimentally realized framework of electromagnetically induced transparency. We specifically focus on {\Lambda}-type alkali-based cold atomic systems. This network allows us to analyze all the alkali atom-based engines' performance. High performance engines are predicted and analyzed based on three figures of merit output, radiation temperature, work and ergotropy. Contrary to traditional notion, the algorithm reveal the limitations of output radiation temperature as a stand alone metric for enhanced engine performance. In high output temperature regime, Cs based engine with a higher output temperature than Rb based engine is characterized by lower work and ergotropy. This is found to be true for different atomic engines with common predicted states in both high and low output temperature regimes. Additionally, the ergotropy is found to exhibit a saturating exponential dependency on the control Rabi frequency.</description>

      <title>Stable excitations and holographic transportation in tensor networks of critical spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence conjectures a duality between quantum gravity theories in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and conformal field theories (CFTs) on the boundary. One intriguing aspect of this correspondence is that it offers a pathway to explore quantum gravity through tabletop experiments. Recently, a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) model of AdS/CFT that can be implemented using contemporary quantum simulators has been proposed [R. Sahay, M. D. Lukin, and J. Cotler, arXiv:2401.13595 (2024)]. Particularly, local bulk excitations (entitled "hologrons") manifesting attractive interactions given by AdS gravity were found. However, the fundamental question concerning the stability of these identified hologrons is still left open. Here, we address this question and find that hologrons are unstable during dynamic evolution. In searching for stable bulk excitations with attractive interactions, we find they can be constructed by the local primary operators in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we identify a class of boundary excitations that exhibit the bizarre behavior of "holographic transportation", which can be directly observed on the boundary system implemented in experiments.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Experimental Bound on the Maximum Predictive Power of Physical Theories in Multi-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The completeness of quantum mechanics in predictive power is a central question in its foundational study. While most investigations focus on two-dimensional systems, high-dimensional systems are more general and widely applicable. Building on the non-extensibility theorem by Colbeck and Renner [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 050403 (2008)], which established that no higher theory can enhance the predictive power of quantum mechanics for two-dimensional systems, we extend this result to arbitrarily dimensional systems. We connect maximum potential predictive power achievable by any alternative theory to experimentally observable correlations, and establish optimal experimental bounds across varying dimensions by exploiting two-photon orbital angular momentum entangled states with entanglement concentration. These bounds falsify a broader class of alternative theories, including Bell's and Leggett's models, and those that remain theoretically ambiguous or experimentally unverified. Our findings not only deepen the foundational understanding of quantum mechanics but also hold significant potential for high-dimensional quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Crypto-nonlocality in arbitrarily dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Bell's theorem, any model based on local variables cannot reproduce certain quantum correlations. A critical question is whether one could devise an alternative framework, based on nonlocal variables, to reproduce quantum correlations while adhering to fundamental principles. Leggett proposed a nonlocal model, termed crypto-nonlocality, rooted in considerations of the reality of photon polarization, but this property restricted it to being bi-dimensional. In this Letter, we extend the crypto-nonlocal model to higher dimensions and develop a framework for constructing experimentally testable Leggett-type inequalities for arbitrary dimensions. Our investigation into models that yield specific predictions exceeding those of quantum mechanics is intriguing from an information-theoretic perspective and is expected to deepen our understanding of quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum State Reconstruction with Structured Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the prevailing method for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices; however, its application to large quantum systems is rendered impractical due to the exponential growth in both the required number of total state copies and classical computational resources. Recently, the classical shadow (CS) method has been introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative, capable of accurately predicting key quantum state properties. Despite its advantages, a critical question remains as to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a projected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST based on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS method by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a general quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum of $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the Frobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to $O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r&lt;2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal bounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that the PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state copies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of $O(n^3)$. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCS method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| $ and of the unitary Weyl operators enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for estimating the number of shots required for some desired variance in the results of a quantum circuit. First, we establish a baseline for a single qubit characterization of individual noise sources separately. We then extend the method to multi-qubit problems and test our method on two case studies. We will proceed to estimate the number of shots required for a desired variance in the result or, equivalently estimate the variance at a known number of shots. We will show we're able to estimate variance accurately to within a factor of 2. Following these, we also provide a closed-form expression for variance at a given number of shots.</description>

      <title>Visualizing quantum entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates without state vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring polymer self-consistent field theory is used to calculate the critical temperatures and heat capacities of an ideal Bose gas for an order of magnitude more particles than previously reported. A lambda-transition indicative of Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as expected. Using a known proof of spatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between boson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without the use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a thermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the "imaginary time", to map classical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through the theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and contextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring polymer threads in thermal-space. A possible extension to fermions is mentioned.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an approach for transferring quantum states from superconducting qubits to the internal states of trapped atoms or ions. To achieve state transfer, we utilize the Rydberg levels of those trapped atomic particles, which interact indirectly with the superconducting qubits via their mutual coupling to a microwave cavity. We investigate two protocols for this transfer: resonant interaction between the cavity, the atom/ion and the superconducting qubit, and dispersive interaction. We analyze the robustness of the state transfer fidelity against various noise and damping mechanisms, including cavity decay, Rydberg state decay, and the relaxation and dephasing of the superconducting qubit. For experimentally demonstrated parameters of interaction strengths, dissipation, and dephasing, our scheme achieves fidelities above 95\%.</description>

      <title>Compact superconducting vacuum-gap capacitors with low microwave loss and high mechanical coherence for scalable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum gap capacitors have recently gained considerable attention in superconducting circuit platforms due to their compact design and low dielectric losses in the microwave regime. Their ability to support mechanical vibrational modes makes them ideal candidates for circuit optomechanics. However, precise control of gap size and achieving high coherence in mechanical modes remain long-standing challenges. Here, we present a detailed fabrication process for scalable vacuum gap capacitors that support ultra-high-coherence mechanical motion, exhibit low microwave loss, and maintain a small footprint compared to planar geometries. We fabricate arrays of up to 24 LC resonators, with capacitors featuring nanometer-scale gap size variations. We demonstrate that the mechanical quality factors can reach up to $40 \times 10^6$, a 100-fold improvement over other platforms, with microwave quality factors $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ at low photon number levels. This platform also achieves a sizable single-photon optomechanical coupling rate of approximately 20 Hz. Using this, we cooled the mechanical oscillator to its ground state (0.07 quanta) and squeezed its motion below the vacuum level by 2.7 dB. We further demonstrate the scalability of this platform by implementing large-scale optomechanical arrays, a strained graphene model, and observing quantum collective phenomena in a mechanical hexamer. These vacuum gap capacitors are promising candidates for coupling superconducting qubits with mechanical systems, serving as storage elements in quantum computing, and exploring gravitational effects on quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We consider an imaging scheme, inspired by microscopy, in which both correlation imaging and first-order intensity imaging can be performed simultaneously, to investigate the effects of strong turbulence on the two different kinds of images. The comparison between direct and correlation imaging in the presence of strong turbulence unambiguously revealed an advantage of the latter. Remarkably, this advantage, quantified by analyzing the visibility of periodic sample patterns, is more striking when the presence of turbulence becomes the dominant factor in determining the image resolution.</description>

      <title>A Complex Hilbert Space for Classical Electromagnetic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a complex Hilbert Space with Hermitian operators for calculations in classical electromagnetism. This approach lets us derive a variety of fundamental expressions for electromagnetism using minimal mathematics and a calculation sequence well-known for traditional quantum mechanics. The purpose of this Hilbert Space is not to calculate the expectation values of known observables, however, like in Koopman-von Neumann-Sudarshan (KvNS) mechanics (for classical point particles) and quantum mechanics (quantum waves or fields). We also demonstrate the existence of the wave commutation relationship $[\hat{x},\hat{k}]=i$, which is the never seen before classical analogue to the canonical commutator $[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. The difference between classical and quantum mechanics lies in the presence of $\hbar$. This is the first report of noncommutativity of observables for a classical theory. Further comparisons between electromagnetism, KvNS classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics are made. Finally, supplementing the analysis presented, we additionally demonstrate for the first time a completely relativistic version of Feynman's proof of Maxwell's equations \citep{Dyson}. Unlike what \citet{Dyson} indicated, there is no need for Galilean relativity for the proof to work. This fits parsimoniously with our usage of classical commutators for electromagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of magnetic moments in electrodynamics is examined in this work. The effects are described in the context of conventional quantum electrodynamics expressed in terms of the electromagnetic fields or in the context of an extended Poynting theorem and extended Maxwell equations. These extensions take into account the energetics of interaction of magnetic moments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a selection of experimental results on metallic cuprates, both above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ (often called the strange metal state) and in the superconducting state. It highlights this still poorly understood part of the physical world. After an introduction, I talk briefly about the pseudogap regime and about the unusual linear resistivity phenomenon. Several empirical correlations between observed quantities are mentioned, e.g. $T_c$ and superfluid density (Uemura), $T_c$ and next nearest neighbour hopping, slope of the linear resistivity and $T_c$. In the belief that a comprehensive explanation may need an understanding of the extremely strongly correlated metal, a few initial steps in this direction are outlined.</description>

Abstract: We study the classification problem of mixed states in two-dimensional quantum spin systems in the operator algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics. We associate a braided $C^*$-tensor category to each state satisfying a mixed-state version of the approximate Haag duality. We study how this category behaves under decoherence: suppose the state is acted by a finite depth quantum channel. We prove that the braided $C^*$-tensor category of the final state is a braided $C^*$-tensor subcategory of the initial state.</description>

      <title>On the Klein-Gordon scalar field oscillators in a spacetime with spiral-like dislocations in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of two types of spiral dislocation (the distortion of the radial line, labeled as spiral dislocation I, and the distortion of a circle, labeled as spiral dislocation II) on the relativistic dynamics of the Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillator fields, both in the presence and absence of external magnetic fields. In this context, our investigations show that while spiral dislocation I affects the energies of the KG oscillators (with or without the magnetic field), spiral dislocation II has, interestingly, no effect on the KG oscillator's energies unless a magnetic field is applied. However, for both types of spiral dislocations, we observe that the corresponding wave functions incorporate the effects of the dislocation parameter. Our findings are based on the exact solvability and conditional exact solvability (associated with the biconfluent Heun polynomials) of the KG oscillators (with or without the magnetic field, respectively) for spiral dislocation I, and the exact solvability of the KG oscillators (with or without the magnetic field) for spiral dislocation II. The exact solvability of the latter suggests that the oscillator's frequency is solely determined by the magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Photonic Modes in Twisted Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of photonic modes in twisted graphene nanoribbons (TGNRs) using an analytical approach based on solving the fully covariant vector boson equation. We present a model that demonstrates how helical twisting in TGNRs significantly affects the evolution of photonic modes. Our analytical solutions yield detailed expressions for mode profiles, energy spectra, and decay characteristics. We find that increasing the twist parameter shortens the decay times (\(\tau_{ns}\)) for damped modes, indicating enhanced photonic coupling due to the twisted geometry. Conversely, longer nanoribbons (NRs) exhibit increased decay times, showing a length (\(L\))-dependent effect, where \(\tau_{ns} \propto L / c\), with \(c\) representing the speed of light. These findings may enhance the understanding of light control in nanostructures and suggest potential applications in tunable photonic devices, topological photonics, and quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate, in the framework of linearized quantum gravity, the quantum gravitational interaction between a gravitoelectrically polarizable object and a gravitomagnetically polarizable object. This interaction originates from the coupling between the instantaneous mass quadrupole moment and the mass-current quadrupole moment of the objects, induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields in a vacuum. Using leading-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit expression of the quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows a distance dependence of $r^{-8}$ in the near regime and $r^{-11}$ in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. Remarkably, this interaction energy is positive, indicating that the force is repulsive. Since interactions between objects polarizable in the same gravitoelectric or gravitomagnetic manner are inherently attractive, for objects which are both gravitoelectrically and gravitomagnetically polarizable, the overall quantum gravitational interaction potential is reduced when the repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction is taken into account. However, for two isotropically polarizable objects with identical gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic polarizabilities and energy level spacing, the repulsive quantum interaction cannot surpass the attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear Rice-Mele model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) constitutes a fundamental concept within the domain of topological physics, elucidating the profound interplay between the topological invariants that characterize the bulk states and the emergent edge states. A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing BEC under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.126601}{ T. Isobe {\it et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)}]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover BEC of eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a novel form of BEC based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous BEC of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous BEC defined herein provides a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of BEC.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms via velocity selection memory in a hot vapor cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study resonance redistribution mechanisms inside a hot vapor cell. This is achieved by pumping atoms on the first cesium resonance, 6S1/2--&gt;6P1/2, and subsequently probing the velocity distribution of the 6P1/2 population by a linear absorption experiment on the 6P1/2--&gt;16S1/2 or 6P1/2--&gt;15D3/2 transitions at 514 nm and 512 nm respectively. We demonstrate that despite the existence of thermalization processes, traces of the initial velocity selection, imposed by the pump, survive in both hyperfine levels of the intermediate (6P1/2) state. This observation, allows us to perform sub-Doppler resolution vapor cell spectroscopy on Rydberg states using a simple pump-probe setup. At high cesium densities, redistribution mechanisms dominate, and the velocity selection vanishes. However, spectral analysis provides information on the collisional shifts and broadenings of the probed Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Perspectivism vs Nietzschean Perspectivism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a work of hard physical philosophy, where Quantum Perspectivism is shown to function as both an interpretation of quantum mechanics and a physical model for understanding Nietzsche's perspectivism. This framework combines quantum logic, the principle of complementarity, and contextuality to examine how perspectives construct reality. In this model, measurements correspond to Perspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and Hilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert lattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological reality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a given system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding meta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality.
  Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single measurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed properties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis of multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete understanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and contextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of classical objectivity in the quantum domain. Advocating for a perspectival view of both the world and truth, Quantum Perspectivism unites quantum mechanics and Nietzschean philosophy into a cohesive framework for exploring the interplay between consciousness, observation, and reality.</description>

      <title>Floquet geometric squeezing in fast-rotating condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing and manipulating quantum states in fast-rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) has long stood as a significant challenge as the rotating speed approaching the critical velocity. Although the recent experiment [Science, 372, 1318 (2021)] has realized the geometrically squeezed state of the guiding-center mode, the remaining degree of freedom, the cyclotron mode, remains unsqueezed due to the large energy gap of Landau levels. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a Floquet-based state-preparation protocol by periodically driving an anisotropic potential. This protocol not only facilitates the single cyclotron-mode squeezing, but also enables a two-mode squeezing. Such two-mode squeezing offers a richer set of dynamics compared to single-mode squeezing and can achieve wavepacket width well below the lowest Landau level limit. Our work provides a highly controllable knob for realizing diverse geometrically squeezed states in ultracold quantum gases within the quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <title>Image-charge detection of electrons on helium in an on-chip trapping device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of superfluid helium have been thought of as a useful resource for quantum computing. Such electrons show long coherence of their surface-bound (Rydberg) states combined with their easy electrostatic manipulation. Recent proposals explored the possibility of coupling the spin state of an electron and the state of its quantized motion with a promise of a highly scalable 2D architecture for a quantum computer. However, despite recent progress in the detection of quantized lateral motion of electrons using a circuit-QED setup, the manipulation of a small number of electrons and their quantum state detection remains a challenging problem. Here, we report on the detection of the Rydberg transition of electrons on superfluid helium in an on-chip microchannel device in which electrons are moved and trapped by a set of electrostatic gates. A highly sensitive image-charge detection system allows us not only to resolve the transition spectra of such electrons, but also to perform the device characterization. The demonstrated sensitivity shows the feasibility of detecting the Rydberg transition of a single electron, which can open a new pathway for a non-destructive spin-state readout.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided receiver for multi-target detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Furthermore, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum estimation of signal parameters by designing a rotational invariance based technique termed as RAQ-ESPRIT relying on our model. The proposed algorithm solves the sensor gain mismatch problem, which is due to the presence of the RF local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA and cannot be well addressed by using the conventional ESPRIT. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic disorder-induced topological phases and their intricate multifractal nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, following a significant improvement in their control fidelities over recent years. Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fanouts. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. By changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV we tune the exchange energy $J$ from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in a Quantum Point Contact Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free fermion systems is sufficient to "thermalize" a small subsystem in that the subsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of the combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any interactions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only minimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion system) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two 2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC) is examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system is in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the linear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and small subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy $S_A \sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by each additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite size/temperature conformal scaling: $\Delta S_A = \alpha \log{(1/E)\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small number of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical, ergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might affect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties themselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Impact of cut-off frequency effect on resonance energy transfer and Casimir-Polder interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Green's function approach, we investigate the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between two parallel, identical two-level atoms in the presence of three types of cylindrical system: a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), a perfectly reflecting wall (PRW), and a two-layer silicon fiber. Our analysis, incorporating the cut-off frequency condition, reveals significant suppression of the RET rate for atoms positioned along the axis of the cylinder with the PRW. In contrast, for atoms located within the DBR, the RET rate is enhanced in the far zone. Additionally, we find that for atoms oriented radially are placed inside or near the surface of the silicon fiber, the RET rate is entirely inhibited. We also investigate the Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction between a cut-off-frequency DBR and an excited atom, discovering a fully attractive potential towards the surface for the atom within the waveguide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic temporal crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of PTCs that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic temporal crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.</description>

      <title>Tunable absorption spectrum splitting in a pulse-driven three-level system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a two-level system is driven on resonance by a strong incident field, its emission spectrum is characterized by the well-known Mollow triplet. If the absorption from the excited state, in this continuously driven two-level system, to a third, higher energy level, is probed by a weak field, the resulting absorption spectrum features the Autler-Townes doublet with two peaks separated by the Rabi frequency of the strong driving field. It has been shown that when the two-level system is instead driven by a periodic pulse sequence, the emission spectrum obtained has similarities with the Mollow triplet even though the system is only driven during the short application time of the pulses and is allowed to evolve freely between pulses. Here, we evaluate the absorption spectrum of the three-level system in the ladder/cascade configuration when the bottom two levels are driven by a periodic pulse sequence while the transition between the middle and the highest level is probed by a weak field. The absorption spectrum displays similarities with the Autler-Townes doublet with frequency separation between the main peaks defined by the inter-pulse delay. In addition, this spectrum shows little dependence on the pulse carrier frequency. These results demonstrate the capacity to modulate the absorption spectrum of a three-level system with experimentally achievable pulse protocols.</description>

      <title>The membership problem for constant-sized quantum correlations is undecidable</title>

Abstract: When two spatially separated parties make measurements on an unknown entangled quantum state, what correlations can they achieve? How difficult is it to determine whether a given correlation is a quantum correlation? These questions are central to problems in quantum communication and computation. Previous work has shown that the general membership problem for quantum correlations is computationally undecidable. In the current work we show something stronger: there is a family of constant-sized correlations -- that is, correlations for which the number of measurements and number of measurement outcomes are fixed -- such that solving the quantum membership problem for this family is computationally impossible. Thus, the undecidability that arises in understanding Bell experiments is not dependent on varying the number of measurements in the experiment. This places strong constraints on the types of descriptions that can be given for quantum correlation sets. Our proof is based on a combination of techniques from quantum self-testing and from undecidability results of the third author for linear system nonlocal games.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Landau-Zener tunneling in the crossover regime from weak to strong environment coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landau-Zener tunneling, which describes the transition in a two-level system during a sweep through an anti-crossing, is a model applicable to a wide range of physical phenomena. Realistic quantum systems are affected by dissipation due to coupling to their environments. An important aspect of understanding such open quantum systems is the relative energy scales of the system itself and the system-environment coupling, which distinguishes the weak- and strong-coupling regimes. Using a tunable superconducting flux qubit, we observe the crossover from weak to strong coupling to the environment in Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results confirm previous theoretical studies of dissipative Landau-Zener tunneling in the weak and strong coupling limits. We devise a spin bath model that effectively captures the crossover regime. This work is relevant for understanding the role of dissipation in quantum annealing, where the system is expected to go through a cascade of Landau-Zener transitions before reaching the target state.</description>

      <title>Single-qubit loss-tolerant quantum position verification protocol secure against entangled attackers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protocols for quantum position verification (QPV) which combine classical and quantum information are insecure in the presence of loss. We study the exact loss-tolerance of the most popular protocol for QPV, which is based on BB84 states, and generalizations of this protocol. By bounding the winning probabilities of a variant of the monogamy-of-entanglement game using semidefinite programming (SDP), we find tight bounds for the relation between loss and error for these extended non-local games.
  These new bounds enable the usage of QPV protocols using more-realistic experimental parameters. We show how these results transfer to the variant protocol which combines $n$ bits of classical information with a single qubit, thereby exhibiting a protocol secure against a linear amount of entanglement (in the classical information $n$) even in the presence of a moderate amount of photon loss. Moreover, this protocol stays secure even if the photon encoding the qubit travels arbitrarily slow in an optical fiber. We also extend this analysis to the case of more than two bases, showing even stronger loss-tolerance for that case.
  Finally, since our semi-definite program bounds a monogamy-of-entanglement game, we describe how they can also be applied to improve the analysis of one-sided device-independent QKD protocols.</description>

      <title>A graph-state based synthesis framework for Clifford isometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of Clifford isometry compilation, i.e, how to synthesize a Clifford isometry into an executable quantum circuit. We propose a simple framework for synthesis that only exploits the elementary properties of the Clifford group and one equation of the symplectic group. We highlight the versatility of our framework by showing that several normal forms of the literature are natural corollaries. We recover the state of the art two-qubit gate depth necessary for the execution of a Clifford circuit on an LNN architecture, concomitantly with another work. We also propose practical synthesis algorithms for Clifford isometries with a focus on Clifford operators, graph states and codiagonalization of Pauli rotations. Benchmarks show that in all three cases we improve the 2-qubit gate count and depth of random instances compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We also improve the execution of practical quantum chemistry experiments.</description>

      <title>Certification of unbounded randomness with arbitrary noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random number generators play an essential role in cryptography and key distribution. It is thus important to verify whether the random numbers generated from these devices are genuine and unpredictable by any adversary. Recently, quantum nonlocality has been identified as a resource that can be utilised to certify randomness. Although these schemes are device-independent and thus highly secure, the observation of quantum nonlocality is extremely difficult from a practical perspective. In this work, we provide a scheme to certify unbounded randomness in a semi-device-independent way based on the maximal violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities. Interestingly, the scheme is independent of the choice of the quantum state, and consequently even classical noise like a thermal state or even microwave background radiation could be utilized to self-test quantum measurements and generate unbounded randomness making the scheme highly efficient for practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Convergence Rates for the Quantum Central Limit Theorem</title>

Abstract: The quantum central limit theorem for bosonic quantum systems states that the sequence of states $\rho^{\boxplus n}$ obtained from the $n$-fold convolution of a centered quantum state $\rho$ converges to a quantum Gaussian state $\rho_G$ that has the same first and second moments as $\rho$. In this paper, we contribute to the problem of finding the optimal rate of convergence for this quantum central limit theorem. We first show that if an $m$-mode quantum state has a finite moment of order $\max\{3, 2m\}$, then we have $\|\rho^{\boxplus n} - \rho_G\|_1=\mathcal O(n^{-1/2})$. We also introduce a notion of Poincar\'e inequality for quantum states and show that if $\rho$ satisfies this Poincar\'e inequality, then $D(\rho^{\boxplus n}\| \rho_G)= \mathcal O(n^{-1})$. By giving an explicit example, we verify that both these convergence rates are optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum communications technologies require a network of quantum processors connected with low loss and low noise communication channels capable of distributing entangled states. Superconducting microwave qubits operating in cryogenic environments have emerged as promising candidates for quantum processor nodes. However, scaling these systems is challenging because they require bulky microwave components with high thermal loads that can quickly overwhelm the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator. Telecommunication frequency optical signals, meanwhile, can be fabricated in significantly smaller form factors while avoiding challenges due to high signal loss, noise sensitivity, and thermal loads due to their high carrier frequency and propagation in silica optical fibers. Transduction of information via coherent links between optical and microwave frequencies is therefore critical to leverage the advantages of optics for superconducting microwave qubits, while also enabling superconducting processors to be linked with low-loss optical interconnects. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical control of a superconducting qubit. We achieve this by developing a microwave-optical quantum transducer that operates with up to 1.18% conversion efficiency with low added microwave noise, and demonstrate optically-driven Rabi oscillations in a superconducting qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise an autonomous quantum thermal machine consisting of three pairwise-interacting qubits, two of which are locally coupled to thermal reservoirs. The machine operates autonomously, as it requires no time-coherent control, external driving or quantum bath engineering, and is instead propelled by a chemical potential bias. Under ideal conditions, we show that this out-of-equilibrium system can deterministically generate a maximally entangled steady-state between two of the qubits, or any desired pure two-qubit entangled state, emerging as a dark state of the system. We study the robustness of entanglement production with respect to several relevant parameters, obtaining nearly-maximally-entangled states well-away from the ideal regime of operation. Furthermore, we show that our machine architecture can be generalised to a configuration with $2n-1$ qubits, in which only a potential bias and two-body interactions are sufficient to generate genuine multipartite maximally entangled steady states in the form of a W state of $n$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Complexity Classification of Product State Problems for Local Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Product states, unentangled tensor products of single qubits, are a ubiquitous ansatz in quantum computation, including for state-of-the-art Hamiltonian approximation algorithms. A natural question is whether we should expect to efficiently solve product state problems on any interesting families of Hamiltonians.
  We completely classify the complexity of finding minimum-energy product states for Hamiltonians defined by any fixed set of allowed 2-qubit interactions. Our results follow a line of work classifying the complexity of solving Hamiltonian problems and classical constraint satisfaction problems based on the allowed constraints. We prove that estimating the minimum energy of a product state is in P if and only if all allowed interactions are 1-local, and NP-complete otherwise. Equivalently, any family of non-trivial two-body interactions generates Hamiltonians with NP-complete product-state problems. Our hardness constructions only require coupling strengths of constant magnitude.
  A crucial component of our proofs is a collection of hardness results for a new variant of the Vector Max-Cut problem, which should be of independent interest. Our definition involves sums of distances rather than squared distances and allows linear stretches.
  We similarly give a proof that the original Vector Max-Cut problem is NP-complete in 3 dimensions. This implies that optimizing over product states for Quantum Max-Cut (the quantum Heisenberg model) is NP-complete, even when every term is guaranteed to have positive unit weight.</description>

      <title>Observing Quantum Coherent Oscillations in a Three-Level Atoms via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency by Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has high spectral resolution and is a useful tool for studying atom dynamics. In this paper, we show a smallest unit of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for 2DES, that is, a three-level system. It is found that the original main peak is split into four small ones due to the introduction of the EIT. It suggests that the homogeneous broadening of 2DES can be effectively reduced by the EIT. Moreover, in sharp contrast to a constant height, the height of the peaks will manifest a damped oscillation with respect to the population time. It seems that the quantum-beat phenomenon appears. These findings may help us obtain more information about the dynamics of excited states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers process information with the laws of quantum mechanics. Current quantum hardware is noisy, can only store information for a short time, and is limited to a few quantum bits, i.e., qubits, typically arranged in a planar connectivity. However, many applications of quantum computing require more connectivity than the planar lattice offered by the hardware on more qubits than is available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU). Here we overcome these limitations with error mitigated dynamic circuits and circuit-cutting to create quantum states requiring a periodic connectivity employing up to 142 qubits spanning multiple QPUs connected in real-time with a classical link. In a dynamic circuit, quantum gates can be classically controlled by the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements within run-time, i.e., within a fraction of the coherence time of the qubits. Our real-time classical link allows us to apply a quantum gate on one QPU conditioned on the outcome of a measurement on another QPU which enables a modular scaling of quantum hardware. Furthermore, the error mitigated control-flow enhances qubit connectivity and the instruction set of the hardware thus increasing the versatility of our quantum computers. Dynamic circuits and quantum modularity are thus key to scale quantum computers and make them useful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the generation and optimization of entanglement between atoms chirally coupled to finite 1D spin chains, functioning as {\it spin cavities}. By diagonalizing the spin cavity Hamiltonian, we identify a parity effect that influences entanglement, with small even-sized cavities chirally coupled to atoms expediting entanglement generation by approximately $50\%$ faster than non-chiral coupling. Applying a classical driving field to the atoms reveals oscillations in concurrence, with resonant dips at specific driving strengths due to the resonances between the driven atom and the spin cavity. Extending our study to systems with energetic disorder, we find that high concurrence can be achieved regardless of disorder strength when the inverse participation ratio of the resulting eigenstates is favorable. Finally, we demonstrate that controlled disorder within the cavity significantly enhances and expedites entanglement generation, achieving higher concurrences up to four times faster than those attained in ordered systems.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of logical quantum processors marks a pivotal transition from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. These devices have the potential to address classically challenging problems with polynomial computational time using quantum properties. However, they remain susceptible to noise, necessitating noise resilient algorithms. We introduce Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo (QZMC), a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm that demonstrates resilience to device noise and Trotter errors while showing polynomial computational cost for a gapped system. QZMC computes static and dynamic properties without requiring initial state overlap or variational parameters, offering reduced quantum circuit depth.</description>

      <title>An Operational Framework for Nonclassicality in Quantum Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resources such as entanglement and quantum communication offer significant advantages in distributed information processing. We develop an operational framework for realizing these enhancements in resource-constrained quantum networks. We first compute linear constraints on the input/output probabilities that arise in classical networks with limited communication and globally shared randomness. We then maximize the violation of these classical bounds by applying variational quantum optimization to a parameterized quantum network ansatz that encodes a fixed set of quantum communication resources. A violation of the classical bounds indicates nonclassicality, which means that an explicit communication advantage is realized because extra classical communication is required to simulate the behavior of the quantum network. We demonstrate nonclassicality in many basic point-to-point and multi-point communication networks. In all cases, we find that entanglement-assisted communication, both classical and quantum, leads to nonclassicality. Moreover, networks having multiple senders can exhibit nonclassicality using quantum communication without entanglement-assistance. Finally, we discuss how our approaches can be implemented on quantum networking hardware and used to automatically certify quantum resources and realize communication advantages in noisy quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of many-body open quantum systems is key to solving numerous outstanding problems in physics, chemistry, material science, and in the development of quantum technologies. Near-term quantum computers may bring considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational Ans\"atze are proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model. The results underscore the algorithm's efficiency in simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems in the low-rank regime with limited quantum resources on a near-term quantum device.</description>

Contrary to a previous proposal, there is no need to use an external qubit as the input state to be teleported to one of the qubits within the system. Here, we use a pair of nearest neighbor spins from an infinite spin-1/2 chain in equilibrium with a heat bath as the entangled resource of the quantum teleportation protocol and a third adjacent qubit within the chain itself as the input state to be teleported. For several spin chain models subjected to an external magnetic field, we show that the efficiency of the teleportation protocol is severely affected as we cross the quantum critical points associated with those spin chains. This abrupt change in efficiency gives us a clear indication of a quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Chiral Virasoro algebra from a single wavefunction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Genuine $k$-partite correlations and entanglement in the ground state of the Dicke model for interacting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we calculate and study correlations of the Dicke model in the presence of qubit-qubit interaction. Whereas the analysis of correlations among its subsystems is essential for the understanding of corresponding critical phenomena and for performing quantum information tasks, the majority of correlation measures are restricted to bipartitions due to the inherent challenges associated with handling multiple partitions. To circunvent this we employ the calculation of Genuine Multipartite Correlations (GMC) based on the invariance of our model under particle permutation. We then quantify the correlations within each subpart of the system, as well as the percentage contribution of each GMC of order $k$, highlighting the many-body behaviors for different regimes of parameters. Additionally, we show that GMC signal both first- and second-order quantum phase transitions present in the model. Furthermore, as GMC encompasses both classical and quantum correlations, we employ Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to detect genuine multipartite entanglement. Ultimately, we map the Dicke model with interacting qubits to spin in solids interacting with a quantum field of magnons, thus demonstrating a potential experimental realization of this model.</description>

      <title>A quantum implementation of high-order power method for estimating geometric entanglement of pure states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is one of the fundamental properties of a quantum state and is a crucial differentiator between classical and quantum computation. There are many ways to define entanglement and its measure, depending on the problem or application under consideration. Each of these measures may be computed or approximated by multiple methods. However, hardly any of these methods can be run on near-term quantum hardware. This work presents a quantum adaptation of the iterative higher-order power method for estimating the geometric measure of entanglement of multi-qubit pure states using rank-1 tensor approximation. This method is executable on current (hybrid) quantum hardware and does not depend on quantum memory. We study the effect of noise on the algorithm using a simple theoretical model based on the standard depolarising channel. This model allows us to post hoc mitigate the effects of noise on the results of the computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tunneling is a quantum phenomenon in which a microscopic object crosses through a potential barrier even if its energy cannot overcome the barrier. A general belief is that tunneling occurs only when the barrier width is comparable to, or smaller than the de Broglie's wavelength of the object. Here, we study the tunneling of an ultracold atom among $N$ far-separated trapping potentials in a state-selective optical lattice and present a mechanism to realize long-range tunneling. We find that, mediated by the propagating matter wave emitted from the atom, coherent tunneling of the atom to the remote lattices occurs as long as bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the system formed by the atom and its matter wave. Going beyond the Markovian approximation, and breaking through the conventional distance constraint, our result opens another avenue to realizing tunneling and gives a guideline to developing tunneling devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</description>

      <title>Multi-field quantum conferencing overcomes the network capacity limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum conferencing enables multiple nodes within a quantum network to share a secure group key for private message broadcasting. The key rate, however, is limited by the repeaterless capacity to distribute multiparticle entangled states across the network. Currently, in the finite-size regime, no feasible schemes utilizing existing experimental techniques can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of quantum conferencing in quantum networks without repeaters. Here, we propose a practical, multi-field scheme that breaks this limit, involving virtually establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through post-measurement coincidence matching. This proposal features a measurement-device-independent characteristic and can directly scale to support any number of users. Simulations show that the fundamental limitation on the group key rate can be overcome in a reasonable running time of sending $10^{14}$ pulses. We predict that it offers an efficient design for long-distance broadcast communication in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest to develop a general framework for thermodynamics in the regime of strong coupling and correlations between subsystems of an autonomous quantum "universe" has entailed diverging definitions for basic quantities, including internal energy. While most approaches focus solely on the system of interest, we propose that a universal notion of internal energy should also account for the environment in order to keep consistency with the closed-system energy of the universe. We introduce an abstract framework to describe all effective Hamiltonian-based approaches and address a rigorous definition of energy additivity in this context, in both a weak and a strong forms, discussing the underlying subtleties. As an illustration, we study a particular two-qubit universe model, obtaining the exact master equations for both parties and calculating their effective Hamiltonians and internal energies as given by the recently devised minimal dissipation approach. In this case, we show that internal energies are not additive, which leads to unphysical features.</description>

      <title>Optimization of conveyance of quantum particles by moving potential well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical control of the position of a particle by using a trapping potential well is an important problem for the manipulation of a quantum particle. We study the probability of successful conveyance of a particle trapping in a potential well, i.e., survival probability in the process carrying of the particle for a given length within a given fixed time. For the actual motion of conveyance, we need to accelerate the particle to move and then decelerate it to stop at the destination. First, the relaxation of the survival probability in a constant acceleration rate is studied in detail by direct numerical calculation, the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method, and a method of the resonance states. The survival probability was found to show an exponential decay in a long time, which is analyzed from a viewpoint of eigenvalue problem. An important source of dropoff comes from a non-analytic change of velocity at the starting point. When the rested particle begins to move, the ground state of the rest frame is redistributed to eigenstates of the moving frame, and then each eigenstate of the moving frame evolves in time. The dephasing of wave functions of the distributed populations reduces the probability of successful conveyance. In general, a smooth start gives a small initial disturbance but requires a large acceleration during the process to reach the destination in the fixed time which causes a larger dropoff in the process. Considering these conflicting facts, we study the survival probability in concrete conveyance schemes. We observe the time evolution of the trapped probability and the population distribution during the conveyance process. In cases that the potential well has several bound states, we propose a method to select the particle trapped at the ground state by making use of the difference of survival probabilities of bound states.</description>

      <title>Curvature of Quantum Evolutions for Qubits in Time-Dependent Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the geometry of quantum-mechanical processes, the time-varying curvature coefficient of a quantum evolution is specified by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector to the state vector. In particular, the curvature coefficient measures the bending of the quantum curve traced out by a parallel-transported pure quantum state that evolves in a unitary fashion under a nonstationary Hamiltonian that specifies the Schrodinger evolution equation. In this paper, we present an exact analytical expression of the curvature of a quantum evolution for a two-level quantum system immersed in a time-dependent magnetic field. Specifically, we study the dynamics generated by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. The two parameters specify the constant temporal rates of change of the polar and azimuthal angles used in the Bloch sphere representation of the evolving pure state. To better grasp the physical significance of the curvature coefficient, showing that the quantum curve is nongeodesic since the geodesic efficiency of the quantum evolution is strictly less than one and tuning the two Hamiltonian parameters, we compare the temporal behavior of the curvature coefficient with that of the speed and the acceleration of the evolution of the system in projective Hilbert space. Furthermore, we compare the temporal profile of the curvature coefficient with that of the square of the ratio between the parallel and transverse magnetic field intensities. Finally, we discuss the challenges in finding exact analytical solutions when extending our geometric approach to higher-dimensional quantum systems that evolve unitarily under an arbitrary time-dependent Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We explore how III-V semiconductor microring resonators can efficiently generate photon pairs and squeezed vacuum states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion by utilizing their built-in quasi phase matching and modal dispersion. We present an analytic expression for the biphoton wave function of photon pairs generated by weak pump pulses, and characterize the squeezed states that result under stronger pumping conditions. Our model includes loss, and captures the statistics of the scattered photons. A detailed sample calculation shows that for low pump powers conversion efficiencies of 10$^{-5}$, corresponding to a rate of 39 MHz for a pump power of 1 $\mu$W, are attainable for rudimentary structures such as a simple microring coupled to a waveguide, in both the continuous wave and pulsed excitation regimes. Our results suggest that high levels of squeezing and pump depletion are attainable, possibly leading to the deterministic generation of non-Gaussian states</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key concept of quantum information theory is that accessing information encoded in a quantum system requires us to discriminate between several possible states the system could be in. A natural generalization of this problem, namely, quantum sequence discrimination, appears in various quantum information processing tasks, the objective being to determine the state of a finite sequence of quantum states. Since such a sequence is a composite quantum system, the fundamental question is whether an optimal measurement is local, i.e., comprising measurements on the individual members, or collective, i.e. requiring joint measurement(s). In some known instances of this problem, the optimal measurement is local, whereas in others, it is collective. But, so far, a definite prescription based solely on the problem description has been lacking. In this paper, we prove that if the members of a given sequence are drawn secretly and independently from an ensemble or even from different ensembles, the optimum success probability is achievable by fixed local measurements on the individual members of the sequence, and no collective measurement is necessary. This holds for both minimum-error and unambiguous state discrimination paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of wave packets in a parabolic optical lattice formed by combining an optical lattice with a global parabolic trap. Our study examines the phase space representation of the system's eigenstates by comparing them to the classical phase space of a pendulum, to which the system effectively maps. The analysis reveals that quantum states can exhibit mixed dynamics by straddling the separatrix. A key finding is that the dynamics around the separatrix enables the controlled creation of highly non-classical states, distinguishing them from the classical oscillatory or rotational dynamics of the pendulum. By considering a finite momentum of the initial wave packet, we demonstrate various dynamical regimes. Furthermore, a slight energy mismatch between nearly-degenerate states localized at opposite turning points of the trap potential results in controlled long-range dynamical tunneling. These results can be interpreted as quantum beating between a clockwise rotating and a counterclockwise rotating pendulum.</description>

Abstract: Fully revealing the mathmatical structure of quantum contextuality is a significant task, while some known contextuality theories are only applicable for rank-1 projectors. That is because they adopt the observable-based definitions. This paper overcomes the challenges faced by some known contextuality theories by establishing an event-based contextuality theory with exclusive partial Boolean algebra, which is used to describe the contextual systems with local consistency and exclusivity principle. Our theory provides a precise mathematical framework for quantum contextuality, which can handle the scenarios composed of general projectors, and introduces a more complete contextuality hierarchy. We prove that the Kochen-Specker contextuality is equivalent to the state-independent and strong contextuality. Therefore, when considering both the strength and proportion of contextual quantum states, Kochen-Specker contextuality is the strongest.</description>

      <title>Designing Majorana Quasiparticles in InAsP Quantum Dots in InP Nanowires with Variational Quantum Eigenvalue Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases, these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). Surprisingly, in some cases, as we increase $p_{min}$ the filtered mutual information tends to plateaus at values very close to $S^{vN}_A$ over some range of $p_{min}$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with the QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Lean classical-quantum hybrid neural network model for image classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of algorithms from quantum information with neural networks has enabled unprecedented advancements in various domains. Nonetheless, the application of quantum machine learning algorithms for image classiffcation predominantly relies on traditional architectures such as variational quantum circuits. The performance of these models is closely tied to the scale of their parameters, with the substantial demand for parameters potentially leading to limitations in computational resources and a signiffcant increase in computation time. In this paper, we introduce a Lean Classical-Quantum Hybrid Neural Network (LCQHNN), which achieves efffcient classiffcation performance with only four layers of variational circuits, thereby substantially reducing computational costs. We apply the LCQHNN to image classiffcation tasks on public datasets and achieve a classiffcation accuracy of 99.02% on the dataset, marking a 5.07% improvement over traditional deep learning methods. Under the same parameter conditions, this method shows a 75% and 70.59% improvement in training convergence speed on two datasets. Furthermore, through visualization studies, it is found that the model effectively captures key data features during training and establishes a clear association between these features and their corresponding categories. This study conffrms that the employment of quantum algorithms enhances the model's ability to handle complex classiffcation problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implementation of quantum engines and quantum heat pumps where the quantum adiabatic transformations are replaced by quantum Zeno strokes. During these strokes, frequent measurements are selectively performed on the external state of the system avoiding transition between different levels. This effectively delivers almost ideal isentropic transformations. We concentrate on the characterization of the performance of a quantum Zeno heat pump implemented with a quantum harmonic oscillator, showing that optimal performance can be achieved faster than with shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques.</description>

      <title>Harvesting stabilizer entropy and non-locality from a quantum field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed {\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) \cite{Leone_2022_SRE}. In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field, using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is a fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field even when one can harvest the necessary resources for it.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Preserving Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing quantum computers can only operate with hundreds of qubits in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) state, while quantum distributed computing (QDC) is regarded as a reliable way to address this limitation, allowing quantum computers to achieve their full computational potential. However, similar to classical distributed computing, QDC also faces the problem of privacy leakage. Existing research has introduced quantum differential privacy (QDP) for privacy protection in central quantum computing, but there is no dedicated privacy protection mechanisms for QDC. To fill this research gap, our paper introduces a novel concept called quantum R\'enyi differential privacy (QRDP), which incorporates the advantages of classical R\'enyi DP and is applicable in the QDC domain. Based on the new quantum R\'enyi divergence, QRDP provides delicate and flexible privacy protection by introducing parameter $\alpha$. In particular, the QRDP composition is well suited for QDC, since it allows for more precise control of the total privacy budget in scenarios requiring multiple quantum operations. We analyze a variety of noise mechanisms that can implement QRDP, and derive the lowest privacy budget provided by these mechanisms. Finally, we investigate the impact of different quantum parameters on QRDP. Through our simulations, we also find that adding noise will make the data less usable, but increase the level of privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction Without Encoding via the Circulant Structure of Pauli Noise and the Fast Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for correcting the output distribution of a quantum computer that does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more physical qubits. Thus, it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum error correction codes. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel (we can bias the noise with twirling), the ideal output distribution and noisy distribution in the standard basis are related by a stochastic matrix. We prove that this matrix has a circulant block structure. Thus, the ideal distribution can be retrieved from the noisy output distribution by applying the Fast Fourier Transform. Moreover, due to its circulant structure, characterization of this matrix can be achieved by sampling a single circuit. The results are corroborated with quantum hardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, 5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum phase estimation, and 10-qubit and 20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits. The correction process dramatically improves the accuracies of the output distributions. For 30-qubit GHZ state preparation, a corrected distribution fidelity of 97.7% is achieved from an initial raw fidelity of 23.2%.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Characterization of Quantum Many-Body Scars using Commutant Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic $\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we discuss its implications to dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantum Communication Complexity of Classical Auctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental, classical mechanism design problem of single-buyer multi-item Bayesian revenue-maximizing auctions under the lens of communication complexity between the buyer and the seller. Specifically, we ask whether using quantum communication can be more efficient than classical communication. We have two sets of results, revealing a surprisingly rich landscape - which looks quite different from both quantum communication in non-strategic parties, and classical communication in mechanism design.
  We first study the expected communication complexity of approximately optimal auctions. We give quantum auction protocols for buyers with unit-demand or combinatorial valuations that obtain an arbitrarily good approximation of the optimal revenue while running in exponentially more efficient communication compared to classical approximately optimal auctions. However, these auctions come with the caveat that they may require the seller to charge exponentially large payments from a deviating buyer. We show that this caveat is necessary - we give an exponential lower bound on the product of the expected quantum communication and the maximum payment.
  We then study the worst-case communication complexity of exactly optimal auctions in an extremely simple setting: additive buyer's valuations over two items. We show the following separations:
  1. There exists a prior where the optimal classical auction protocol requires infinitely many bits, but a one-way message of 1 qubit and 2 classical bits suffices.
  2. There exists a prior where no finite one-way quantum auction protocol can obtain the optimal revenue. However, there is a barely-interactive revenue-optimal quantum auction protocol.
  3. There exists a prior where no multi-round quantum auction protocol with a finite bound on communication complexity can obtain the optimal revenue.</description>

      <title>Restart uncertainty relation for monitored quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive topological phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. However, connection between such intrinsic non-Hermitian topology and Hermitian topology has remained largely elusive. Here, considering the bulk and boundary as an environment and system, respectively, we demonstrate that anomalous boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators exhibit non-Hermitian topology. We study the self-energy capturing the particle exchange between the bulk and boundary, and show that it detects Hermitian topology in the bulk and induces non-Hermitian topology at the boundary. As an illustrative example, we reveal non-Hermitian topology and concomitant skin effect inherently embedded within chiral edge states of Chern insulators. We also identify the emergence of hinge states within effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians at surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators. Furthermore, we comprehensively classify our correspondence across all the tenfold symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors.

Abstract: An observer at rest with the expanding universe experiences some extra noise in the quantum vacuum, and so does an accelerated observer in a vacuum at rest (in Minkowski space). The literature mainly focuses on the ideal cases of exponential expansion (de-Sitter space) or uniform acceleration (Rindler trajectories) or both, but the real cosmic expansion is non-exponential and real accelerations are non-uniform. Here we use the frequency-time Wigner function of vacuum correlations to define time-dependent spectra. We found excellent Planck spectra for a class of realistic cosmological models, but also strongly non-Planckian, negative Wigner functions for a standard scenario testable with laboratory analogues.</description>

      <title>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Producing entangled photon pairs and quantum squeezed states in plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma is capable of mediating the conversion of two pump photons into two different photons through a relativistic four-wave mixing nonlinearity. Spontaneously created photon pairs are emitted at symmetric angles with respect to the colinear pump direction, and the emission rate is largest if they have identical frequency. Thus, two orthogonally polarized pumps can produce polarization-entangled photon pairs through a mm-long homogeneous plasma. The noise from Raman scattering can be avoided if the pump detuning differs from twice the plasma frequency. On the other hand, pump detuning exactly equal to twice the plasma frequency can significantly enhance the interaction rate, which allows for the production of strong two-mode squeezed states. Remarkably, the amplified noise from Raman scattering are correlated and hence can be suppressed in one of the output quadratures, thereby maintaining the squeezing magnitude.</description>

      <title>Electronic interferometry with ultrashort plasmonic pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. Although their coherence time is limited, flying electrons in the form of picosecond plasmonic pulses could be competitive in terms of the number of achievable coherent operations. The key challenge in achieving this critical milestone is the development of a new technology capable of injecting 'on-demand' single-electron wavepackets into quantum devices, with temporal durations comparable to or shorter than the device dimensions. Here, we take a significant step towards achieving this regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single-electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our results establish that quantum coherence is robust under the on-demand injection of ultrashort plasmonic pulses, as evidenced by the observation of coherent oscillations in the single-electron regime. Building on this, our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a new "non-adiabatic" regime that is prominent at high frequencies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localised qubit architectures, offering advantages such as a reduced hardware footprint, enhanced connectivity, and scalability for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Many-body tunneling in a double-well potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering an alternative perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena such as superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Thermomajorization Mpemba Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive physical phenomenon where a hot system cools faster than a warm one. In recent years, theoretical analyses of the Mpemba effect have been developed for microscopic systems and experimentally verified. However, the conventional theory relies on a specific choice of distance measure to quantify relaxation speed, leading to several theoretical ambiguities. In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels.</description>

      <title>Coupling quantum-like cognition with the neuronal networks within generalized probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum theory methodologies and quantum-like modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena such as order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach. In this paper, we develop a quantum-like representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on generalized probability theory (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework. Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments a critical aspect of this model. This GPT based approach successfully reproduces key quantum-like effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects (commonly associated with decision interference). Moreover, this framework supports quantum-like modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions such as depression and epilepsy. While this paper focuses primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a wide range of biological and social networks.</description>

Abstract: We carefully review the hierarchical construction by Bouch [Bouch2015] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ denotes the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. (As discussed in Section IV.A of [ParkerCaoAvdoshkinScaffidiAltman2019] and Appendix A.3 of [ShiraishiTasaki2024], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.)</description>

      <title>Flat Bands and Compact Localised States: A Carrollian roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>
