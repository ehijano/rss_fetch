      <title>Motivic homotopy theory with ramification filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to connect two important and apparently unrelated theories: motivic homotopy theory and ramification theory. We construct motivic homotopy categories over a qcqs base scheme $S$, in which cohomology theories with ramification filtrations are representable. Every such cohomology theory enjoys basic properties such as the Nisnevich descent, the cube-invariance, the blow-up invariance, the smooth blow-up excision, the Gysin sequence, the projective bundle formula and the Thom isomorphism. In case $S$ is the spectrum of a perfect field, the cohomology of every reciprocity sheaf is upgraded to a cohomology theory with a ramification filtration represented in our categories. We also address relations of our theory with other non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic homotopy theories such as the logarithmic motivic homotopy theory of Binda, Park, and {\O}stv{\ae}r and the theory of motivic spectra of Annala-Iwasa.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic $A$-hypergeometric series ${\textrm I}\! {\textrm I}\! {\textrm I}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the third in a series exploring Frobenius's method for $A$-hypergeometric systems. Frobenius's method is a classical technique for constructing logarithmic series solutions of differential equations by perturbing exponents of generic series solutions. We show that all $A$-hypergeometric series solutions can be obtained via this method.
  Building upon our prior studies, we develop a duality framework between formal power series and differential operators, introduce minimal vectors with respect to a generic weight, and establish key results on logarithmic coefficients of $A$-hypergeometric series. We extend Frobenius's method and prove its sufficiency in constructing all $A$-hypergeometric series solutions. Furthermore, we explore conditions under which the Frobenius method developed in our previous studies suffices and we pose an open question on the necessity of the extended one.</description>

      <title>Equality of tropical rank and dimension for tropical linear series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tropical rank of a semimodule of rational functions on a metric graph mirrors the concept of rank in linear algebra. Defined in terms of the maximal number of tropically independent elements within the semimodule, this quantity has remained elusive due to the challenges of computing it in practice. In this note, we establish that the tropical rank is, in fact, precisely equal to the topological dimension of the semimodule, one more than the dimension of the associated linear system of divisors. Moreover, we show that the equality of divisorial and tropical ranks in the definition of tropical linear series is equivalent to the pure dimensionality of the corresponding linear system. We conclude with complementary results and questions on combinatorial and topological properties of the tropical rank.</description>

      <title>On the topology of real algebraic stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by questions arising in the theory of moduli spaces in real algebraic geometry, we develop a range of methods to study the topology of the real locus of a Deligne-Mumford stack over the real numbers. As an application, we verify in several cases the Smith-Thom type inequality for stacks that we conjectured in an earlier work. This requires combining techniques from group theory, algebraic geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>On deformations of Azumaya algebras with quadratic pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a tangent-obstruction theory for Azumaya algebras equipped with a quadratic pair. Under the assumption that either 2 is a global unit or the algebra is of degree 2, we show how the deformation theory of these objects reduces to the deformation theory of the underlying Azumaya algebra. Namely, if the underlying Azumaya algebra has unobstructed deformations then so does the quadratic pair.
  On the other hand, in the purely characteristic 2 setting, we construct an Azumaya algebra with unobstructed deformations which can be equipped with a quadratic pair such that the associated triple has obstructed deformations. Our example is a biquaternion Azumaya algebra on an Igusa surface.
  Independently from the above results, we also introduce a new obstruction for quadratic pairs, existing only in characteristic 2, which is intermediate to both the strong and weak obstructions that were recently introduced by Gille, Neher, and the second named author. This intermediate obstruction characterizes when a canonical extension of the Lie algebra sheaf of the automorphism group scheme of some quadratic triple is split.</description>

      <title>Topological groupoids with involution and real algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a topological groupoid endowed with an involution, we associate a topological groupoid of fixed points, generalizing the fixed-point subspace of a topological space with involution. We prove that when the topological groupoid with involution arises from a Deligne-Mumford stack over $\mathbb{R}$, this fixed locus coincides with the real locus of the stack. This provides a topological framework to study real algebraic stacks, and in particular real moduli spaces. Finally, we propose a Smith-Thom type conjecture in this setting, generalizing the Smith-Thom inequality for topological spaces endowed with an involution.</description>

In this article we provide a complete and explicit description of the locus formed by the compact Riemann surfaces of genus $2(p-1)$ that are endowed with a group of automorphisms of order $4p$. In addition, we provide isogeny decompositions of the corresponding Jacobian varieties and study if the most symmetric ones admit complex and real multiplication.</description>

      <title>Regularity and bounded $t$-structures for algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work shows (the expected) cohomological characterization for regularity of (Noetherian) algebraic stacks; such a stack is regular if and only if all complexes with bounded and coherent cohomology are perfect. This naturally enables us to extend various statements known for schemes to algebraic stacks. In particular, the conjectures by Antieau--Gepner--Heller and Bondal--Van den Bergh, both resolved for schemes by Neeman, are proven for suitable algebraic stacks.</description>

Abstract: Finiteness and duality of cohomology of families of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules were proved by Kedlaya-Pottharst-Xiao. In this paper, we study solid locally analytic representations introduced by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'iguez Camargo in terms of analytic stacks and 6-functor formalisms, which are developed by Clausen-Scholze, Heyer-Mann, respectively. By using this, we will provide a generalization of the result of Kedlaya-Pottharst-Xiao, giving a new proof for cases already proved there.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the Riemann hierarchy and the geometry of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann hierarchy is the simplest example of rank one, ($1$+$1$)-dimensional integrable system of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs. It corresponds to the dispersionless limit of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy. In the language of formal variational calculus, we address the classification problem for deformations of the Riemann hierarchy satisfiying different extra requirements (general deformations, defomations as systems of conservation laws, Hamiltonian deformations, and tau-symmetric deformations), under the natural group of coordinate transformations preserving each of those requirements. We present several results linking previous conjectures of Dubrovin--Liu--Yang--Zhang (for the tau-symmetric case) and of Arsie--Lorenzoni--Moro (for systems of conservation laws) to the double ramification hierarchy construction of integrable hierarchies from partial CohFTs and F-CohFTs. We prove that, if the conjectures are true, DR hierarchies of rank one are universal objects in the space of deformations of the Riemann hierarchy. We also prove a weaker version of the DLYZ conjecture and that the ALM conjecture implies (the main part of) the DLYZ conjecture. Finally we characterize those rank one F-CohFTs which give rise to Hamiltonian deformations of the Riemann hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We extend Berthelot's theory of arithmetic D-modules to a class of morphisms that are not necessarily of finite type. As an application we give a new construction of the category of convergent isocrystals on a separated scheme of finite type over a field, and show that the pullback by Frobenius is an auto-equivalence. This extends results of Berthelot that were proven in the smooth case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two $\mathbb{P}$-objects in some algebraic triangulated category, we investigate the possible relations among the associated $\mathbb{P}$-twists. The main result is that, under certain technical assumptions, the $\mathbb{P}$-twists commute if and only if the $\mathbb{P}$-objects are orthogonal. Otherwise, there are no relations at all. In particular, this applies to most of the known pairs of $\mathbb{P}$-objects on hyperk\"ahler varieties. In order to show this, we relate $\mathbb{P}$-twists to spherical twists and apply known results about the absence of relations between pairs of spherical twists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using pagoda flop transitions between smooth projective threefolds, a relation is derived between the Euler numbers of moduli spaces of stable pairs which are scheme-theoretically supported on a fixed singular space curve and Euler numbers of Flag Hilbert schemes associated to a plane curve singularity. When the space curve singularity is locally complete intersection, one obtains a relation between the latter and Euler numbers of Hilbert schemes of the space curve singularity. It is also shown that this relation yields explicit results for a class of torus-invariant locally complete intersection singularities.</description>

Abstract: We show that much of local class theory can be deduced from the Dieudonn\'e-Manin structure theory for $F$-isocrystals on an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. As a consequence we get a new proof of a formula of Dwork for the norm residue symbol, as well as a "constructive" proof of the local Shafarevich-Weil theorem. This last answers a question of Morava.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the possible ways of gluing twisted products of circles with asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau manifolds to produce manifolds with holonomy G_2, thus generalising the twisted connected sum construction of Kovalev and Corti, Haskins, Nordstr\"om, Pacini. We then express the extended nu-invariant of Crowley, Goette, and Nordstr\"om arXiv:1505.02734 in terms of fixpoint and gluing contributions, which include different types of (generalised) Dedekind sums. Surprisingly, the calculations involve some non-trivial number-theoretical arguments connected with special values of the Dedekind eta-function and the theory of complex multiplication. One consequence of our computations is that there exist compact G_2-manifolds that are not G_2-nullbordant.</description>

      <title>Loop group methods for the non-abelian Hodge correspondence on a 4-punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-abelian Hodge correspondence is a real analytic map between the moduli space of stable Higgs bundles and the deRham moduli space of irreducible flat connections mediated by solutions to the self-duality equations. In this paper we construct self-duality solutions for strongly parabolic $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb C)$ Higgs fields on a $4$-punctured sphere with parabolic weights $t \sim 0$ using complex analytic methods. We identify the rescaled limit hyper-K\"ahler moduli space $\mathcal M_t$ at $t=0$ to be the completion of the nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb C)$ modulo a $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$ action, equipped with the Eguchi-Hanson metric. Our methods and computations are based on the twistor approach to the self-duality equations using Deligne and Simpson's $\lambda$-connections interpretation. By construction we can compute the Taylor expansions of the holomorphic symplectic form $\varpi_t$ on $\mathcal M_t$ at $t=0$ which turn out to have closed form expressions in terms of multiple polylogarithms (MPLs). The geometric properties of $\mathcal M_t$ lead to some identities of certain MPLs which we believe deserve further investigations.</description>

      <title>Mittag-Leffler modules and variants on intersection flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study the intersection flatness and Ohm-Rush properties for modules over a commutative ring, drawing inspiration from the work of Ohm and Rush and of Hochster and Jeffries. We establish new structural results for modules that are intersection flat/Ohm-Rush by exhibiting intimate connections between these notions and the seminal work of Raynaud and Gruson on Mittag-Leffler modules. In particular, we develop a theory of Ohm-Rush modules that is parallel to the theory of Mittag-Leffler modules. We also obtain descent and local-to-global results for intersection flat/Ohm-Rush modules. Our investigations reveal a particularly pleasing picture for flat modules over a complete local ring, in which case many otherwise distinct properties coincide.</description>

      <title>Gaitsgory's central functor and the Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov equivalence in mixed characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the nearby cycles functor for the $p$-adic Hecke stack at parahoric level is perverse t-exact, by developing a theory of Wakimoto filtrations at Iwahori level, and that it lifts to the $\mathbb{E}_1$-center. We apply these tools to construct the Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov functor for $p$-adic affine flag varieties at Iwahori level, and prove that it is an equivalence for all classical groups and also exceptional groups of type $E_6$ and $E_7$.</description>

      <title>Duality and kernels in microlocal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dualizability of sheaves on manifolds with isotropic singular supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda(M)$ and microsheaves with isotropic supports $\operatorname{\mu sh}_\Lambda(\Lambda)$ and obtain a classification result of colimit-preserving functors by convolutions of sheaf kernels. Moreover, for sheaves with isotropic singular supports and compact supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^b(M)_0$, the standard categorical duality and Verdier duality are related by the wrap-once functor, which is the inverse Serre functor in proper objects, and we thus show that the Verdier duality extends naturally to all compact objects $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^c(M)_0$ when the wrap-once functor is an equivalence, for instance, when $\Lambda$ is a full Legendrian stop or a swappable Legendrian stop.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and cofiniteness of fine Selmer groups over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06938v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the dual fine Selmer group of an abelian variety over the unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extension of a function field is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This is a function field version of a conjecture of Coates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite (respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety is finite (respectively zero). These results are then generalized to certain ramified $p$-adic Lie extensions.</description>

      <title>$(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over relatively discrete algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will consider $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over rings which are "combinations of discrete algebras and affinoid $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras", and prove basic results such as the existence of a fully faithful functor from the category of Galois representations, the deperfection of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over perfect period rings, and the dualizability of the cohomology of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. This work is motivated by the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for locally analytic representations, as proposed by Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, and the $GL_1$ case, as formulated and proved by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'iguez Camargo.</description>
