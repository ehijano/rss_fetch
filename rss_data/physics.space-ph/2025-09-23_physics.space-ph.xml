      <title>The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located &gt;=90 degrees from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging for the Debris Disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the inner debris disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani using simulated observations with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C). Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we generate synthetic scattered-light images and spectral energy distributions for three disk models that differ in inclination and radial extent, and compare these results with the anticipated performance of CPI-C. CPI-C can resolve disk structures down to $\sim$3 au, offering substantially finer spatial resolution than existing HST/STIS and Spitzer/IRS observations. Recovered inclinations and radial extents closely match the input models, constraining the disk geometry and informing potential planet-disk interactions in the $\epsilon$ Eri system. Although the cold Jupiter-like planet $\epsilon$ Eri b is not detected in our simulations, polarimetric methods may enable detection of its reflected light. These results highlight the capability of next-generation coronagraphs to probe cold dust in nearby planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux ropes within reconnection exhausts close to the centers of heliospheric current sheets near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between magnetic flux ropes and magnetic reconnection is fundamental to both space and astrophysical plasma studies. In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are &lt;20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by &lt;10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Solar-Terrestrial Plasma and Magnetic Field on the Detection of Space-borne Gravitational Wave Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detections raise new questions for heliophysics: how the Sun-Terrestrial space environment affect gravitational wave detection, and to what extent? Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft Measurements of the Evolving Geometry of the Solar Alfv\'en Surface Over Half a Solar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of a star's Alfv\'en surface determines stellar angular momentum loss, separates a causally distinct 'corona' and stellar wind, and potentially affects exoplanetary habitability. The solar Alfv\'en surface is the only such structure that is directly measurable and since 2021, has been routinely measured in situ by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker). We use these unique measurements in concert with Solar Orbiter and L1 in situ data spanning the first half of the Solar Cycle 25 in time and from 0.045 - 1 au in heliocentric distance to develop a radial scaling technique to estimate the morphology of the Alfv\'en surface from measurements of the solar wind speed and local Alfv\'en speed. We show that accounting for solar wind acceleration and mass flux is necessary to achieve reasonable agreement between the scaled location of the Alfv\'en surface and the locations of direct crossings measured by Parker. We produce continuous 2D equatorial cuts of the Alfv\'en surface over half a Solar Cycle (ascending phase and maximum). Parker's earliest crossings clipped outward extrusions, many of which are likely transient related, while more recently Parker has unambiguously sampled deep sub-Alfv\'enic flows. We analyze the average altitude, departure from spherical symmetry, and surface roughness, finding that all are positively correlated to solar activity. For the current modest Solar Cycle, the height varies up to 30\% which corresponds to a near-doubling in angular momentum loss per unit mass loss.</description>

      <title>BepiColombo at Mercury: Three flybys, three magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the first three BepiColombo Mercury flybys Using data from the Miniature Ion Precipitation Analyzer (MIPA), an ion mass analyzer in the Search for Exospheric Refilling and Natural Abundances (SERENA) package on the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) designed to study magnetospheric dynamics. These flybys all passed from dusk to dawn through the nightside equatorial region but were noticeably different from each other. In the first flyby, we observe a low latitude boundary layer and $\sim$1 keV ions near closest approach. For flybys 2 and 3 we see ions up to 14 keV in the same location, including freshly injected precipitating ions inside the loss cone. High time resolution data from flyby 3 show variations consistent with bursty bulk flows 10s long and occurring over $\sim30$s periods, the first such observation in this region. MIPA data demonstrate that high-energy injection processes are an important source of precipitation ions at Mercury.</description>
