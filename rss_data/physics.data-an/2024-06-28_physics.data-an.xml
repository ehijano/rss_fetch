      <title>ViPErLEED package I: Calculation of $I(V)$ curves and structural optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a widely used technique in surface-science. Yet, it is rarely used to its full potential. The quantitative information about the surface structure, contained in the modulation of the intensities of the diffracted beams as a function of incident electron energy, LEED I(V), is underutilized. To acquire these data, minor adjustments would be required in most experimental setups, but existing analysis software is cumbersome to use. ViPErLEED (Vienna package for Erlangen LEED) lowers these barriers, introducing a combined solution for data acquisition, extraction, and computational analysis. These parts are discussed in three separate publications. Here, the focus is on the computational part of ViPErLEED, which performs automated LEED-I(V) calculations and structural optimization. Minimal user input is required, and the functionality is significantly enhanced compared to existing solutions. Computation is performed by embedding the Erlangen tensor-LEED package (TensErLEED). ViPErLEED manages parallelization, monitors convergence, and processes input and output. This makes LEED I(V) more accessible to new users while minimizing the potential for errors and the manual labor. Added functionality includes structure-dependent defaults, automatic detection of bulk and surface symmetries and their relationship, automated symmetry-preserving search procedures, adjustments to the TensErLEED code to handle larger systems, as well as parallelization and optimization. Modern file formats are used as input and output, and there is a direct interface to the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package. The software is implemented primarily in Python (version &gt;=3.7) and provided as an open-source package (GNU GPLv3 or later). A structure determination of the $\alpha$-Fe2O3(1-102)-(1x1) surface is presented as an example for the application of the software.</description>

      <title>Refinable modeling for unbinned SMEFT analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present techniques for estimating the effects of systematic uncertainties in unbinned data analyses at the LHC. Our primary focus is constraining the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT), but the methodology applies to broader parametric models of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). We elevate the well-established procedures for binned Poisson counting experiments to the unbinned case by utilizing machine-learned surrogates of the likelihood ratio. This approach can be applied to various theoretical, modeling, and experimental uncertainties. By establishing a common statistical framework for BSM and systematic effects, we lay the groundwork for future unbinned analyses at the LHC. Additionally, we introduce a novel tree-boosting algorithm capable of learning highly accurate parameterizations of systematic effects. This algorithm extends the existing toolkit with a versatile and robust alternative. We demonstrate our approach using the example of an SMEFT interpretation of highly energetic top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian identification of nonseparable Hamiltonians with multiplicative noise using deep learning and reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a structure-preserving Bayesian approach for learning nonseparable Hamiltonian systems using stochastic dynamic models allowing for statistically-dependent, vector-valued additive and multiplicative measurement noise. The approach is comprised of three main facets. First, we derive a Gaussian filter for a statistically-dependent, vector-valued, additive and multiplicative noise model that is needed to evaluate the likelihood within the Bayesian posterior. Second, we develop a novel algorithm for cost-effective application of Bayesian system identification to high-dimensional systems. Third, we demonstrate how structure-preserving methods can be incorporated into the proposed framework, using nonseparable Hamiltonians as an illustrative system class. We assess the method's performance based on the forecasting accuracy of a model estimated from-single trajectory data. We compare the Bayesian method to a state-of-the-art machine learning method on a canonical nonseparable Hamiltonian model and a chaotic double pendulum model with small, noisy training datasets. The results show that using the Bayesian posterior as a training objective can yield upwards of 724 times improvement in Hamiltonian mean squared error using training data with up to 10% multiplicative noise compared to a standard training objective. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of the novel algorithm for parameter estimation of a 64-dimensional model of the spatially-discretized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with data corrupted by up to 20% multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Impact of recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters on the effective Majorana neutrino mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>

      <title>Improvement of system identification of stochastic systems via Koopman generator and locally weighted expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of equations from data is of interest in physics. One of the famous methods is the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which utilizes sparse estimation techniques to estimate equations from data. Recently, a method based on the Koopman operator has been developed; the generator extended dynamic mode decomposition (gEDMD) estimates a time evolution generator of dynamical and stochastic systems. However, a naive application of the gEDMD algorithm cannot work well for stochastic differential equations because of the noise effects in the data. Hence, the estimation based on conditional expectation values, in which we approximate the first and second derivatives on each coordinate, is practical. A naive approach is the usage of locally weighted expectations. We show that the naive locally weighted expectation is insufficient because of the nonlinear behavior of the underlying system. For improvement, we apply the clustering method in two ways; one is to reduce the effective number of data, and the other is to capture local information more accurately. We demonstrate the improvement of the proposed method for the double-well potential system with state-dependent noise.</description>
