      <title>A physics-enhanced multi-modal fused neural network for predicting contamination length interval in pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the operation of a multi-product pipeline, an accurate and effective prediction of contamination length interval is the central key to guiding the cutting plan formulation and improving the economic effect. However, the existing methods focus on extracting implicit principles and insufficient feature correlations in a data-driven pattern but overlook the potential knowledge in the scientific theory of contamination development, may cause practically useless results. Consequently, in this study, the holistic feature correlations and physical knowledge are extracted and integrated into the neural network to propose a physics-enhanced adaptive multi-modal fused neural network (PE-AMFNN) for contamination length interval prediction. In PE-AMFNN, a multi-modal adaptive feature fusion module is created to establish a comprehensive feature space with quantified feature importance, thus capturing sufficient feature correlations. Subsequently, a mechanism-coupled customized neural network is designed to incorporate the explicit scientific principle into the forward and backward propagation. Besides, a physics-embedded loss function, which introduces interval differences and interval correlation constraints, is established to unearth the latent physical knowledge in contamination development and force the model to draw physically unreasonable results. Validation on the real-world cases implies that the proposed model outperforms the start-of-art techniques and latest achievements, with Root Mean Squared Relative Errors reduced by 31% and 36% in lower and upper limit prediction. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of model modules suggests that both the multi-modal feature fusion and the physical principle are crucial for model improvements</description>

      <title>Investigation on domain adaptation of additive manufacturing monitoring systems to enhance digital twin reusability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powder bed fusion (PBF) is an emerging metal additive manufacturing (AM) technology that enables rapid fabrication of complex geometries. However, defects such as pores and balling may occur and lead to structural unconformities, thus compromising the mechanical performance of the part. This has become a critical challenge for quality assurance as the nature of some defects is stochastic during the process and invisible from the exterior. To address this issue, digital twin (DT) using machine learning (ML)-based modeling can be deployed for AM process monitoring and control. Melt pool is one of the most commonly observed physical phenomena for process monitoring, usually by high-speed cameras. Once labeled and preprocessed, the melt pool images are used to train ML-based models for DT applications such as process anomaly detection and print quality evaluation. Nonetheless, the reusability of DTs is restricted due to the wide variability of AM settings, including AM machines and monitoring instruments. The performance of the ML models trained using the dataset collected from one setting is usually compromised when applied to other settings. This paper proposes a knowledge transfer pipeline between different AM settings to enhance the reusability of AM DTs. The source and target datasets are collected from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Cheng Kung University with different cameras, materials, AM machines, and process parameters. The proposed pipeline consists of four steps: data preprocessing, data augmentation, domain alignment, and decision alignment. Compared with the model trained only using the source dataset, this pipeline increased the melt pool anomaly detection accuracy by 31% without any labeled training data from the target dataset.</description>

      <title>Data-driven surrogate model for etch rate profiles using sensor data from a reactive ion etcher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable predictions of the etch rate profile are desirable in semiconductor manufacturing to prevent etch rate target misses and yield rate excursions. Conventional methods for analyzing etch rate require extensive metrology, which adds considerable costs to manufacturing. We demonstrate a data-driven method to predict the etch rate profiles of a capacitively-coupled plasma RIE etcher from the tool's sensor data. The model employs a hybrid autoencoder-multiquadric interpolation-based approach, with the autoencoder being used to encode the features of the wafers' etch rate profiles into a latent space representation. The tool's sensor data is then used to construct interpolation maps for the latent space variables using multiquadric radial basis functions, which are then used to generate synthetic wafer etch rate profiles using the decoder. The accuracy of the model is determined using experimental data, and the errors are analyzed in interpolation and extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Ethical Artificial Intelligence Principles and Guidelines for the Governance and Utilization of Highly Advanced Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the success of ChatGPT, LaMDA and other large language models (LLMs), there has been an increase in development and usage of LLMs within the technology sector and other sectors. While the level in which LLMs has not reached a level where it has surpassed human intelligence, there will be a time when it will. Such LLMs can be referred to as advanced LLMs. Currently, there are limited usage of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) principles and guidelines addressing advanced LLMs due to the fact that we have not reached that point yet. However, this is a problem as once we do reach that point, we will not be adequately prepared to deal with the aftermath of it in an ethical and optimal way, which will lead to undesired and unexpected consequences. This paper addresses this issue by discussing what ethical AI principles and guidelines can be used to address highly advanced LLMs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Tensor Networks for Laminate Design: A Novel Approach to Stacking Sequence Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.</description>

      <title>FiSTECH: Financial Style Transfer to Enhance Creativity without Hallucinations in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial report generation using general purpose large language models (LLMs) pose two major challenges namely, the lack of compound sentences and hallucinations. Advanced prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques are limited in scope for curing these writing style discrepancies. In this work we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning (FT) process wherein public domain financial reports are processed into prompt-completions and augmented using simple LLM prompts to then enable sectional financial report generation using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs. The proposed fine-tuning process exploits the self-learning capability of LLMs by allowing hallucinations in the first stage and showing the corrections in the second stage. Our proposed fine-tuning framework results doubles the number of correct questions answers and reduces hallucinations by over 50%. Additionally, the two-stage FT model has lower perplexity, improved ROUGE, TER and BLEU scores, higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy. Thus, the proposed framework can be generalized to domain specific fine-tuning tasks at minimized tuning costs.</description>
