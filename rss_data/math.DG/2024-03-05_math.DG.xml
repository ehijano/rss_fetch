      <title>An eternal hypersurface flow arising in centro-affine geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the existence and uniqueness for a specific centro-affine invariant hypersurface flow in $R^{n+1}$ are studied, and the corresponding evolutionary processes in both centro-affine and Euclidean settings are explored. It turns out that the flow exhibits similar properties as the standard heat flow. In addition, the long time existence of the flow is investigated, which asserts that the hypersurface governed by the flow converges asymptotically toward an ellipsoid via systematically investigating evolutions of the centro-affine invariants. Furthermore, the classification of the eternal solutions for the flow is provided.</description>

      <title>The rigidity of minimal Legendrian submanifolds in the Euclidean spheres via eigenvalues of fundamental matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rigidity problem for compact minimal Legendrian submanifolds in the unit Euclidean spheres via eigenvalues of fundamental matrices, which measure the squared norms of the second fundamental form on all normal directions. By using Lu's inequality on the upper bound of the squared norm of Lie brackets of symmetric matrices, we establish an optimal pinching theorem for such submanifolds of all dimensions, giving a new characterization for the Calabi tori. This pinching condition can also be described by the eigenvalues of the Ricci curvature tensor. Moreover, when the third large eigenvalue of the fundamental matrix vanishes everywhere, we get an optimal rigidity theorem under a weaker pinching condition.</description>

Abstract: We characterize geodesic flows, admitting two commuting quadratic integrals with common principal directions, in terms of the geodesic 4-webs such that the tangents to the web leaves are common zero directions of the integrals. We prove that, under some natural geometric hypothesis, the metric is of St\"ackel type.</description>

      <title>A new characterization for Clifford hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a closed minimal immersed hypersurface $M$ in $\mathbb S^{n+1}$ with second fundamental form $A$, and each integer $k\ge 2$, define a constant $\sigma_k=\dfrac{\int_M (|A|^2)^k}{|M|}$. We show that $\sigma_k \ge 2^k$ provided $n=2$ and $M$ is not totally geodesic. When $n=4$ and $M$ has two distinct principal curvatures, we show $\sigma_2 \ge 16$. When $n\ge 3$ and $M$ has two distinct principal curvatures, for each integer $k\ge 2$, there exists a positive constant $\delta_k(n)&lt;n$, if $|A|^2\ge \delta_k(n)$, we have $\sigma_k\ge n^k$. All the equality holds iff $M$ is isometric to a Clifford hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Almost Ricci solitons on Finsler spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, (gradient) almost Ricci solitons on Finsler measure spaces $(M, F, m)$ are introduced and investigated. We prove that $(M, F, m)$ is a gradient almost Ricci soliton if and only if the infinity-Ricci curvature Ric$_\infty$ is a scalar function on $M$ when $M$ is compact. Moreover, we give an equivalent characterization of (gradient) almost Ricci solitons for Randers metrics $F=\alpha+\beta$, which implies that every Randers (gradient) almost Ricci soliton is of isotropic S$_{BH}$-curvature. Based on this and the navigation technique, we further classify Randers almost Ricci solitons (resp. gradient almost Ricci solitons) up to classifications of Randers Einstein metrics $F$ (resp. Riemannian gradient almost Ricci solitons) and the homothetic vector fields of $F$ (resp. solutions of the equation which the weight function $f$ of $m$ satisfies) when $F$ has isotropic S$_{BH}$-curvature. As applications, we obtain some rigidity results for compact Randers (gradient) Ricci solitons and construct several Randers gradient Ricci solitons, which are the first nontrivial examples of gradient Ricci solitons in Finsler geometry.</description>

      <title>The ultimate upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit conjugate points on the Stiefel manifold endowed with any member of the family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021). This family contains the well-known canonical and Euclidean metrics. An upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold in the considered metric is then obtained as the minimum between the length of the geodesic along which the points are conjugate and the length of certain geodesic loops. Numerical experiments support the conjecture that the obtained upper bound is in fact equal to the injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Finitary estimates for the distribution of lattice orbits in homogeneous spaces I: Riemannian metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H &lt; G$ both be noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic groups and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a lattice. Building on the work of Gorodnik-Weiss, we refine their techniques and obtain effective results. More precisely, we prove effective convergence of the distribution of dense $\Gamma$-orbits in $G/H$ to some limiting density on $G/H$ assuming effective equidistribution of regions of maximal horospherical orbits under one-parameter diagonal flows inside a dense $H$-orbit in $\Gamma \backslash G$. The significance of the effectivized argument is due to the recent effective equidistribution results of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang for $\Delta(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ and $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ and arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$, and future generalizations in that direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new notion of curvature on the edges of a graph that is defined in terms of effective resistances. We call this the Ricci--Foster curvature. We study the Ricci flow resulting from this curvature. We prove the existence of solutions to Ricci flow on short time intervals, and prove that Ricci flow preserves graphs with nonnegative (resp. positive) curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by conjectures in Mirror Symmetry, we continue the study of the real Monge--Amp\`ere operator on the boundary of a simplex. This can be formulated in terms of optimal transport, and we consider, more generally, the problem of optimal transport between symmetric probability measures on the boundary of a simplex and of the dual simplex. For suitably regular measures, we obtain regularity properties of the transport map, and of its convex potential. To do so, we exploit boundary regularity results for optimal transport maps by Caffarelli, together with the symmetries of the simplex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a compact symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$ with a Hamiltionan circle action. Then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. Recent works study the case when the fixed point set consists of precisely $n+1$ isolated points. Motivated by these works, this paper studies a Hamiltonian $S^1$ action on a $10$-dimensional compact symplectic manifold with exactly 6 isolated fixed points. Under a condition, we study the relations of the following data: the first Chern class of the manifold,the largest weight of the action, all the weights of the action,the total Chern class of the manifold, and the integral cohomology ring of the manifold. We show that if one of these data is identical with that of a coadjoint orbit of the exceptional Lie group $G_2$, equipped with a Hamiltonian action of a subcircle of the maximal torus, then the other data are identical with this coadjoint orbit of $G_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systole $\text{sys}(\alpha)$ of a contact form $\alpha$ is defined as the shortest period of closed Reeb orbits of $\alpha$. Given a non-trivial $\mathbb S^1$-principal bundle over $\mathbb S^2$ with total space $M$, we prove that the inequality $\text{sys}(\alpha)^2 \leq \text{vol}(M, \alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}\alpha)$ holds true for any tight contact form $\alpha$ invariant under the corresponding circle action. Moreover, equality holds exactly for Zoll contact forms, namely, contact forms whose Reeb orbits are all closed and have the same minimal period. This implies a sharp systolic inequality for rotationally symmetric Finsler metrics on $\mathbb S^2$, and a particular case of a conjecture by Viterbo.</description>

Abstract: With a f-left-invariant Riemannian metric on a Lie group $G$, we mean a Riemannian metric which is conformally equivalent to a left-invariant Riemannian metric, with the conformal factor $f$. In this article, we study the geometry of such metrics and give a necessary and sufficient condition for an f-left-invariant Riemannian metric to be a Ricci soliton. Using this result, for any expansion constant $\lambda$, we obtain a flat gradient Ricci soliton on some two and three-dimensional non-abelian Lie groups. We give an example of a non-flat steady gradient Ricci soliton and construct some examples of non-flat shrinking, steady, and expanding non-gradient Ricci solitons on the non-abelian Lie group $\Bbb{R}\rtimes\Bbb{R}^{+}$. Finally, we study f-left-invariant Riemannian metrics on the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Extremals on Lie groups with asymmetric polyhedral Finsler structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study extremals on Lie groups $G$ endowed with a left invariant polyhedral Finsler structure. We use the Pontryagin's Maximal Principle (PMP) to find curves on the cotangent bundle of the group, such that its projections on $G$ are extremals. Let $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak g^\ast$ be the Lie algebra of $G$ and its dual space respectively. We represent this problem as a control system $\mathfrak a^\prime (t)= -\mathrm{ad}^\ast(u(t))(\mathfrak a(t))$ of Euler-Arnold type equation, where $u(t)$ is a measurable control in the unit sphere of $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak a(t)$ is an absolutely continuous curve in $\mathfrak g^\ast$. A solution $(u(t), \mathfrak a(t))$ of this control system is a Pontryagin extremal and $\mathfrak a(t)$ is its vertical part. In this work we show that for a fixed vertical part of the Pontryagin extremal $\mathfrak a(t)$, the uniqueness of $u(t)$ such that $(u(t),\mathfrak a(t))$ is a Pontryagin extremal can be studied through an asymptotic curvature of $\mathfrak a(t)$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the rigidity of rectifiable boundaries with constant distributional mean curvature in the Brendle class of warped product manifolds (which includes important models in General Relativity, like the deSitter--Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstrom manifolds). As a corollary we characterize limits of rectifiable boundaries whose mean curvatures converge, as distributions, to a constant. The latter result is new, and requires the full strength of distributional CMC-rigidity, even when one considers smooth boundaries whose mean curvature oscillations vanish in arbitrarily strong $C^k$-norms.</description>

      <title>Vertex algebras from the Hull-Strominger system</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the programme on mirror symmetry for non-K\"ahler manifolds, we construct representations of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra associated to solutions of the Hull-Strominger system. The construction is via embeddings of the $N=2$ superconformal vertex algebra in the chiral de Rham complex of a string Courant algebroid. Our results require that the connection $\nabla$, one of the unknowns of the system, is Hermitian-Yang-Mills. Our main theorem proves that any solution of the Hull-Strominger system satisfying this condition has an associated $N=2$ embedding.</description>

      <title>Einstein-type metrics and generalized Ricci solitons on weak $f$-K-contact manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A weak metric $f$-structure $(f,Q,\xi_i,\eta^i,g)\ (i=1,\ldots,s)$, generalizes the metric $f$-structure on a smooth manifold, i.e., the complex structure on the contact distribution is replaced with a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor. We study geometry of a weak $f$-K-contact structure, which is a weak $f$-contact structure, whose characteristic vector fields are Killing. We show that $\ker f$ of a weak $f$-contact manifold defines a $\mathfrak{g}$-foliation with an abelian Lie algebra. Then we characterize weak $f$-K-contact manifolds among all weak metric $f$-manifolds by the property known for $f$-K-contact manifolds, and find when a Riemannian manifold endowed with a set of orthonormal Killing vector fields is a weak $f$-K-contact manifold. We show that for $s&gt;1$, an Einstein weak $f$-K-contact manifold is Ricci flat, then find sufficient conditions for a weak $f$-K-contact manifold with parallel Ricci tensor or with a generalized gradient Ricci soliton structure to be Ricci flat or a quasi Einstein manifold. We prove positive definiteness of the Jacobi operators in the characteristic directions and use this to deform a weak $f$-K-contact structure to an $f$-K-contact structure. We define an $\eta$-Ricci soliton and $\eta$-Einstein structures on a weak metric $f$-manifold (which for $s=1$, give the well-known structures on contact metric manifolds) and find sufficient conditions for a compact weak $f$-K-contact manifold with an $\eta$-Ricci soliton structure of constant scalar curvature to be $\eta$-Einstein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that both local and non-local formulations of the Degasperis-Procesi equation possess a pseudospherical nature. As a result, solutions determined by Cauchy problems with non-trivial initial data and a minimal specific regularity define an orthonormal coframe for a pseudospherical metric within a designated strip. While the region is entirely described by the initial condition, the one-forms are determined by the corresponding solutions. Moreover, we establish that any non-trivial initial condition yields a second fundamental form, which is locally determined within the strip. The surface may collapse within a finite-height strip when the initial condition leads to wave breaking. We determine conditions for the coframe to be defined on the upper plane. We investigate possible integrability structures related to the triad of fundamental one-forms.</description>

      <title>On Arnold's Transversality Conjecture for the Laplace-Beltrami Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the structure of the set of Riemannian metrics on a connected manifold such that the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator has an eigenvalue of a given multiplicity. We introduce a simple geometric condition on metrics and show it is equivalent to the strong Arnold hypothesis, which essentially posits that multiple Laplace eigenvalues split up under perturbation like those of symmetric matrices. We prove our condition is satisfied except on a set of infinite codimension, and use this to obtain non-crossing rules for Laplace eigenvalues. Furthermore, we show that our condition is satisfied on all metrics admitting eigenvalues of multiplicity at most seven, and exhibit examples of metrics violating it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sets related to positively curved invariant Riemannian metrics on generalized Wallach spaces are considered. The problem arises in studying of the evolution of such metrics under the normalized Ricci flow equation. For Riemannian metrics of the Wallach spaces $\operatorname{SU}(3)/T_{\max}$, $\operatorname{Sp(3)}/ \left(\operatorname{Sp(1)}\right)^3$ and $F_4/\operatorname{Spin(8)}$ which admit positive sectional curvature and belong to a given invariant surface $\Sigma$ of the normalized Ricci flow we established that they form a set bounded by three connected and pairwise disjoint regular space curves such that each of them approaches two others asymptotically at infinity. Analogously, for all generalized Wallach spaces the set of Riemannian metrics which belong to $\Sigma$ and admit positive Ricci curvature is bounded by three curves each consisting of two connected components as regular curves. Intersections and asymptotical behaviors of these components were studied as well.</description>

      <title>Node-Opening Construction of Maxfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The node-opening technique developed by Traizet has been very useful in constructing minimal surfaces. In this paper, we use the technique to construct families of maximal immersions in Lorentz space that are embedded outside a compact set. Each family depends on a real parameter $t$. The surfaces look like spacelike planes connected by small necks that shrink to singular points as $t \to 0$. The limit positions of the necks must satisfy a balance condition, which turns out to be exactly the same for maxfaces and for minimal surfaces. By simply comparing notes, we obtain a rich variety of new maxfaces with high genus and arbitrarily many space-like ends, including the Lorentzian Costa--Hoffman--Meeks surfaces, thereby remove the scarcity of examples of maxfaces. Moreover, a main task of this paper is to analyse the singularities, an interesting feature that distinguishes maxfaces from minimal surfaces. For sufficiently small non-zero $t$, the singular set consists of curves in the waist of every neck. In generic and some symmetric cases, we are able to prove that all but finitely many singularities are cuspidal edges, and the non-cuspidal singularities are swallowtails.</description>

Abstract: For the distance function from any closed subset of any complete Finsler manifold, we prove that the singular set is equal to a countable union of delta-convex hypersurfaces up to an exceptional set of codimension two. In addition, in dimension two, the whole singular set is equal to a countable union of delta-convex Jordan arcs up to isolated points. These results are new even in the standard Euclidean space and shown to be optimal in view of regularity.</description>

Abstract: Given a holomorphic Lagrangian fibration of a compact hyperkahler manifold, we use the differential geometry of the special Kahler metric that exists on the base away from the discriminant locus, and show that the pullback of the tangent bundle of the base to the total space of a family of minimal rational curves admits a parallel splitting. The splitting is nontrivial when the base is not half-dimensional projective space. Combining this with results of Voisin, Hwang and Bakker-Schnell, we deduce that the base must be projective space, a result first proved by Hwang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds $M$ with volume less than a constant $V$, we prove an inequality regarding the geometric $L^2$-norm and the topological Thurston norm, which is qualitatively sharp and verifies a conjecture of Brock and Dunfield in this case. Generically, we show that the $L^2$-norm is less than a constant $c(V)$ times the Thurston norm by showing that any least area closed surface is disjoint from the thin part.
  We then study the connection between the Thurston norm, best Lipschitz circle-valued maps, and maximal stretch laminations, building on the recent work of Daskalopoulos and Uhlenbeck, and Farre, Landesberg and Minsky. We show that the distance between a level set and its translation is the reciprocal of the Lipschitz constant, bounded by the topological entropy of the pseudo-Anosov monodromy if $M$ fibers. For infinitely many examples constructed by Rudd, we show the entropy is bounded from below by one-third the length of the circumference.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on the height of K-semistable Fano varieties II, the log case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous work we conjectured - inspired by an algebro-geometric result of Fujita - that the height of an arithmetic Fano variety X of relative dimension $n$ is maximal when X is the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}}$ over the integers, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, if the corresponding complex Fano variety is K-semistable. In this work the conjecture is settled for diagonal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}_{\mathbb{Z}}$. The proof is based on a logarithmic extension of our previous conjecture, of independent interest, which is established for toric log Fano varieties of relative dimension at most three, hyperplane arrangements on $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}}$, as well as for general arithmetic orbifold Fano surfaces.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and the Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and we prove the equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$.</description>
