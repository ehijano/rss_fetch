      <title>Forming planetary systems that contain only minor planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimates of the frequency of planetary systems in the Milky Way are observationally limited by the low-mass planet regime. Nevertheless, substantial evidence for systems with undetectably low planetary masses now exist in the form of main-sequence stars which host debris discs, as well as metal-polluted white dwarfs. Further, low-mass sections of star formation regions impose upper bounds on protoplanetary disc masses, limiting the capacity for terrestrial or larger planets to form. Here, we use planetary population synthesis calculations to investigate the conditions that allow planetary systems to form only minor planets and smaller detritus. We simulate the accretional, collisional and migratory growth of $10^{17}$ kg embryonic seeds and then quantify which configurations with *entirely* sub-Earth-mass bodies ($\lesssim 10^{24}$ kg) survive. We find that substantial regions of the initial parameter space allow for sub-terrestrial configurations to form, with the success rate most closely tied to the initial dust mass. Total dust mass budgets of up to $10^2 M_{\oplus}$ within 10 au can be insufficiently high to form terrestrial or giant planets, resulting in systems with only minor planets. Consequently, the prevalence of planetary systems throughout the Milky Way might be higher than what is typically assumed, and minor planet-only systems may help inform the currently uncertain correspondence between planet-hosting white dwarfs and metal-polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Featherweight Giant: Unraveling the Atmosphere of a 17 Myr Planet with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of young planets (&lt; 300 Myr) is pivotal for understanding planet formation and evolution. We present the 3-5$\mu$m transmission spectrum of the 17 Myr, Jupiter-size ($R$ $\sim$10$R_{\oplus}$) planet, HIP 67522 b, observed with JWST/NIRSpec/G395H. To check for spot contamination, we obtain a simultaneous $g$-band transit with SOAR. The spectrum exhibits absorption features 30-50% deeper than the overall depth, far larger than expected from an equivalent mature planet, and suggests that HIP 67522 b's mass is $&lt;$20 $M_{\oplus}$ irrespective of cloud cover and stellar contamination. A Bayesian retrieval analysis returns a mass constraint of $13.8\pm1.0M_{\oplus}$. This challenges the previous classification of HIP 67522 b as a hot Jupiter and instead, positions it as a precursor to the more common sub-Neptunes. With a density of $&lt;$0.10g/cm$^{3}$, HIP 67522 b is one of the lowest density planets known. We find strong absorption from H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ ($\ge7\sigma$), a modest detection of CO (3.5$\sigma$), and weak detections of H$_2$S and SO$_2$ ($\simeq2\sigma$). Comparisons with radiative-convective equilibrium models suggest supersolar atmospheric metallicities and solar-to-subsolar C/O ratios, with photochemistry further constraining the inferred atmospheric metallicity to 3$\times$10 Solar due to the amplitude of the SO$_2$ feature. These results point to the formation of HIP 67522 b beyond the water snowline, where its envelope was polluted by icy pebbles and planetesimals. The planet is likely experiencing substantial mass loss (0.01-0.03 M$_{\oplus}$ Myr$^{-1}$), sufficient for envelope destruction within a Gyr. This highlights the dramatic evolution occurring within the first 100 Myr of its existence.</description>

      <title>Tidally Heated Sub-Neptunes, Refined Planetary Compositions, and Confirmation of a Third Planet in the TOI-1266 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-1266 is a benchmark system of two temperate ($&lt;$ 450 K) sub-Neptune-sized planets orbiting a nearby M dwarf exhibiting a rare inverted architecture with a larger interior planet. In this study, we characterize transit timing variations (TTVs) in the TOI-1266 system using high-precision ground-based follow-up and new TESS data. We confirm the presence of a third exterior non-transiting planet, TOI-1266 d (P = 32.5 d, $M_d$ = 3.68$^{+1.05}_{-1.11} M_{\oplus}$), and combine the TTVs with archival radial velocity (RV) measurements to improve our knowledge of the planetary masses and radii. We find that, consistent with previous studies, TOI-1266 b ($R_b$ = 2.52 $\pm$ 0.08 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_b$ = 4.46 $\pm$ 0.69 $M_{\oplus}$) has a low bulk density requiring the presence of a hydrogen-rich envelope, while TOI-1266 c ($R_c$ = 1.98 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_c$ = 3.17 $\pm$ 0.76 $M_{\oplus}$) has a higher bulk density that can be matched by either a hydrogen-rich or water-rich envelope. Our new dynamical model reveals that this system is arranged in a rare configuration with the inner and outer planets located near the 3:1 period ratio with a non-resonant planet in between them. Our dynamical fits indicate that the inner and outer planet have significantly nonzero eccentricities ($e_b + e_d = 0.076^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$), suggesting that TOI-1266 b may have an inflated envelope due to tidal heating. Finally, we explore the corresponding implications for the formation and long-term evolution of the system, which contains two of the most favorable cool ($&lt;$ 500 K) sub-Neptunes for atmospheric characterization with JWST.</description>

      <title>A PyTorch Benchmark for High-Contrast Imaging Post Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task that involves distinguishing faint planetary signals from the overpowering glare of their host stars, often obscured by time-varying stellar noise known as "speckles". The predominant algorithms for speckle noise subtraction employ principal-based point spread function (PSF) fitting techniques to discern planetary signals from stellar speckle noise. We introduce torchKLIP, a benchmark package developed within the machine learning (ML) framework PyTorch. This work enables ML techniques to utilize extensive PSF libraries to enhance direct imaging post-processing. Such advancements promise to improve the post-processing of high-contrast images from leading-edge astronomical instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope and extreme adaptive optics systems.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey III: Confirmation of 13CO in YSES 1 b and Atmospheric Detection of YSES 1 c with CRIRES+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopic characterization of young super-Jovian planets enables precise constraints on elemental and isotopic abundances of their atmospheres. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we present high-resolution spectral observations of two wide-orbit super-Jupiters in YSES 1 (or TYC 8998-760-1) using the upgraded VLT/CRIRES+ (R~100,000) in K-band. We carry out free atmospheric retrieval analyses to constrain chemical and isotopic abundances, temperature structures, rotation velocities, and radial velocities. We confirm the previous detection of 13CO in YSES 1 b at a higher significance of 12.6{\sigma}, but point to a higher 12CO/13CO ratio of 88+/-13 (1{\sigma} confidence interval), consistent with the primary's isotope ratio 66+/-5. We retrieve a solar-like composition in YSES 1 b with a C/O=0.57+/-0.01, indicating a formation via gravitational instability or core accretion beyond the CO iceline. Additionally, the observations lead to detections of H2O and CO in the outer planet YSES 1 c at 7.3{\sigma} and 5.7{\sigma}, respectively. We constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio of YSES 1 c to be either solar or subsolar (C/O=0.36+/-0.15), indicating the accretion of oxygen-rich solids. The two companions have distinct vsini, 5.34+/-0.14 km/s for YSES 1 b and 11.3+/-2.1 km/s for YSES 1 c, despite their similar natal environments. This may indicate different spin axis inclinations or effective magnetic braking by the long-lived circumplanetary disk around YSES 1 b. YSES 1 represents an intriguing system for comparative studies of super-Jovian companions and linking present atmospheres to formation histories.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: TOI-6383Ab, a giant planet transiting an M3-dwarf star in a binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of a transiting giant planet around the 3500 K M3-dwarf star TOI-6383A located 172 pc from Earth. It was detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and confirmed by a combination of ground-based follow-up photometry and precise radial velocity measurements. This planet has an orbital period of $\sim$1.791 days, mass of 1.040$\pm$0.094 $M_J$ and a radius of 1d.008$^{+0.036}_{-0.033} ~R_J$, resulting in a mean bulk density of 1.26$^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$ g cm$^{-3}$. TOI-6383A has an M-dwarf companion star, TOI-6383B, which has a stellar effective temperature $T_{eff}$ $\sim$ 3100 K and a projected orbital separation of 3100 AU. TOI-6383A is a low-mass dwarf star hosting a giant planet and is an intriguing object for planetary evolution studies due to its high planet-to-star mass ratio. This discovery is part of the \textit{Searching for Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS)} Survey, intending to provide robust and accurate estimates of the occurrence of GEMS and the statistics on their physical and orbital parameters. This paper presents an interesting addition to the small number of confirmed GEMS, particularly notable since its formation necessitates massive, ust-rich protoplanetary discs and high accretion efficiency ($&gt;$ 10\%).</description>

      <title>The trans- and post-capture orbital evolution of Triton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triton is a unique moon in our Solar System, being the only large moon to orbit on a retrograde and highly inclined orbit. As a result, it is thought that it did not form around Neptune, but rather was captured from heliocentric orbit. The resulting tidal heating is likely to have been sufficient to melt Triton's mantle several times over. Previous work on the topic has required simplifying assumptions or application of mathematical methods outside of the domain in which they are well-behaved. In this work, we revisit the description of this period of Triton's history, by developing methods that allow us to simulate high-eccentricity spin-orbit evolution for an arbitrary rheological model. Our aim is to provide a framework on which future work can build with more detailed planetological models, while still capturing the full intricacies of high-eccentricity tidal evolution. We forego simplifications used in past work and rather determine the convergence properties of each infinite sum in the Darwin-Kaula expansion, truncating them appropriately. We achieve this with a new conservative empirical upper bound on the expansion into eccentricity functions of part of the tidal potential, and with a novel, fast-converging power series expansion for these eccentricity functions borrowed from artificial satellite theory. Consequently, we examine the case of Triton. We find that the use of the constant time lag model fails to match the capture into spin-orbit resonances we expect from a sufficiently viscous icy body at non-zero eccentricities. Additionally, we find that Triton can have experienced tidal heating rates orders of magnitude greater even than present-day Io, and so likely possessed a massive Titan-like atmosphere throughout its tidal evolution, with a surface or thin-shell ocean. Whether this would significantly extend the epoch of tidal heating will be the subject of future work.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. I. Introducing the GaiaPMEX tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia mission is expected to yield the detection of several thousands of exoplanets, perhaps at least doubling the number of known exoplanets. Although the harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be published with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database to search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized multiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3 astrometric solution of bright sources (G&lt;16). We have the proper motion anomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of residuals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric signatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source seen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We found that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions with a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that is able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a photocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis (sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos, GaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma. The constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed, coupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of solutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be most frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of Earth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup are more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction, if not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the future using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. II. A catalog of 9,698 planet candidate solar-type hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It characterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma) of a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value of RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly (PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume of sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a new input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future follow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of powerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint stars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used the mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of RUWE to select a sample of bright (G&lt;16) Gaia sources whose companions could be planetary, with a mass &lt;13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698 planet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass &lt;13.5 MJup in the range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the Nasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma, initially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we found 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict the existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources observed with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the identification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42 883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in this 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and stellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this large catalog will be the subject of future studies.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRISS and HST: Exploring the improved ability to characterise exoplanet atmospheres in the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble Space Telescope has been a pioneering instrument for studying the atmospheres of exoplanets, specifically its WFC3 and STIS instruments. With the launch of JWST, we are able to observe larger spectral ranges at higher precision. NIRISS/SOSS covers the range 0.6--2.8 microns, and thus can serve as a direct comparison to WFC3 (0.8--1.7 microns). We perform atmospheric retrievals of WFC3 and NIRISS transmission spectra of WASP-39 b in order to compare their constraining power. We find that NIRISS is able to retrieve precise H2O abundances that do not suffer a degeneracy with the continuum level, due to the coverage of multiple spectral features. We also combine these datasets with spectra from STIS, and find that challenges associated with fitting the steep optical slope can bias the retrieval results. In an effort to diagnose the differences between the WFC3 and NIRISS retrievals, we perform the analysis again on the NIRISS data cut to the same wavelength range as WFC3. We find that the water abundance is in strong disagreement with both the WFC3 and full NIRISS retrievals, highlighting the importance of wide wavelength coverage. Finally, we carry out mock retrievals on the different instruments, which shows further evidence of the challenges in constraining water abundance from the WFC3 data alone. Our study demonstrates the vast information gain of JWST's NIRISS instrument over WFC3, highlighting the insights to be obtained from our new era of space-based instruments.</description>

Abstract: The vertical mixing in hot Jupiter atmospheres plays a critical role in the formation and spacial distribution of cloud particles in their atmospheres. This affects the observed spectra of a planet through cloud opacity, which can be influenced by the degree of cold trapping of refractory species in the deep atmosphere. We aim to isolate the effects of the internal temperature on the mixing efficiency in the atmospheres of Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJ) and the spacial distribution of cloud particles across the globe. We couple a simplified tracer based cloud model, picket fence radiative-transfer scheme and mixing length theory to the Exo-FMS general circulation model. We run the model for five different internal temperatures at typical UHJ atmosphere system parameters. Our results show the convective eddy diffusion coefficient remains low throughout the vast majority of the atmosphere, with mixing dominated by advective flows. However, some regions can show convective mixing in the upper atmosphere for colder interior temperatures. The vertical extent of the clouds is reduced as the internal temperature is increased. Additionally, a global cloud layer gets formed below the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) in the cooler cases. Convection is generally strongly inhibited in UHJ atmospheres above the RCB due to their strong irradiation. Convective mixing plays a minor role compared to advective mixing in keeping cloud particles aloft in ultra hot Jupiters with warm interiors. Higher vertical turbulent heat fluxes and the advection of potential temperature inhibit convection in warmer interiors. Our results suggest isolated upper atmosphere regions above cold interiors may exhibit strong convective mixing in isolated regions around Rossby gyres, allowing aerosols to be better retained in these areas.</description>

Abstract: Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large Program "AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks". The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: $^{12}$CO(J=2-1), $^{13}$CO(J=2-1), C$^{18}$O(J=2-1), and H$_2$CO(J=3$_{(3,0)}$-2$_{(2,0)}$). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of $\sim 150$ mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at $0.57 ^{\prime \prime}$ (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24$^{\prime \prime}$ (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to $3\sigma$) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of $\sim 2.7-12.9$ Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several $^{12}$CO channel maps (angular resolution $\sim$ 200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of $\sim 0.875^{\prime \prime}$ (115.6 au). After modeling the $^{12}$CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dust accumulation of the PDS 70 disk revealed by ALMA Band 3 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PDS 70 system, hosting two planets within its disk, is an ideal target for examining the effect of planets on dust accumulation, growth, and ongoing planet formation. Here, we present high-resolution ($0.''07 = 8 \ \mathrm{au}$) dust continuum observations of the PDS 70 disk in ALMA Band 3 (3.0 mm). While previous Band 7 observations showed a dust ring with slight asymmetry, our Band 3 observations reveal a more prominent asymmetric peak in the northwest direction, where the intensity is 2.5 times higher than in other directions and the spectral index is at the local minimum with $\alpha_{\mathrm{SED}} \sim 2.2$. This indicates that a substantial amount of dust is accumulated both radially and azimuthally in the peak. We also detect point-source emission around the stellar position in the Band 3 image, which is likely to be free-free emission. We constrain the eccentricity of the outer ring to be $e&lt;0.04$ from the position of the central star and the outer ring. From the comparison with numerical simulations, we constrain the mass of PDS 70c to be less than 4.9 Jupiter masses if the gas turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}} = 10^{-3}$. Then, we discuss the formation mechanism of the disk structures and further planet formation scenarios in the disk.</description>

      <title>A synchronous moon as a possible cause of Mars' initial triaxiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14725v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses the possibility of a young Mars having had a massive moon, which synchronised the rotation of Mars, and gave Mars an initial asymmetric triaxiality to be later boosted by geological processes. It turns out that a moon of less than a third of the lunar mass was capable of producing a sufficient initial triaxiality. The asymmetry of the initial tidal shape of the equator depends on timing: the initial asymmetry is much stronger if the synchronous moon shows up already at the magma-ocean stage. From the moment of synchronisation of Mars' rotation with the moon's orbital motion, and until the moon was eliminated (as one possibility, by an impact in the beginning of the LHB), the moon was sustaining an early value of Mars' rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Photoemission of spin-polarized electrons from aligned grains and chiral symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unique biosignature of life on Earth is the homochirality of organic compounds such as amino acids, proteins, and sugars. High-energy spin-polarized (spin-up or spin-down) electrons (SPEs) from the $\beta$ decay of radioactive nuclei were proposed as a source of symmetry breaking, leading to homochirality; however, their exact role is much debated. Here we propose magnetically aligned dust grains as a new source of SPEs due to photoemission of electrons having aligned spins by the Barnett effect. For the interstellar UV radiation field of strength $G_{\rm UV}$, we found that the SPE emission rate is $\Gamma_{\rm pe}^{\rm SPE}\sim 10^{-14}G_{\rm UV}$ electrons per second per H, the fraction of spin-polarized to total photoelectrons is $\sim 10\%$, and the SPE yield (photoelectron number per UV photon) can reach $\sim 1\%$, using the modern theory of grain alignment. SPEs emitted from aligned grains could play an important role in chiral-induced spin selectivity-driven reduction chemistry in the icy grain mantles, producing an enantiomer excess of chiral molecules formed on the grain mantle. Finally, we suggest magnetically aligned grains could directly impact the enantioselectivity through the chiral-induced spin-selective adsorption effect and exchange interaction. We estimated the disalignment of electron spins and depolarization by elastic scattering using the Mott theory and found that these effects are negligible for low-energy SPEs, so that the spins of SPEs remain well aligned during their jurney through dust grains and the gas. Our proposed mechanism might explain the chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules detected in numerous comets, asteroids, and meteorites.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Legacy survey of Class 0/I disks in Corona australis, Aquila, chaMaeleon, oPhiuchus north, Ophiuchus, Serpens (CAMPOS). I. Evolution of Protostellar disk radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I &amp; II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3mm observations with a resolution of 0.1$"$. This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14-18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all evolutionary classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 60\,au decreases as the protostar evolves from Class 0 to Class I. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio ($R_{\rm gas,Kep}/R_{\rm mm}$) with increasing bolometric temperature (${\rm T}_{\rm bol}$). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. However, in the Class 0 stage, the dust and gas disk sizes are similar, which allows a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>
