      <title>What should we understand by the four-momentum of physical system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that in curved spacetime none of the known definitions of four-momentum correspond to the definition, in which all the system particles and fields, including fields outside matter, make an explicit contribution to the four-momentum. This drawback can be eliminated under the assumption that the primary representation of four-momentum is the sum of two nonlocal four-vectors of the integral type with covariant indices. The first of these four-vectors is the generalized four-momentum, found with the help of Lagrangian density. The second four-vector is the four-momentum of fields themselves, and its time component is related to the energy given by tensor invariants. The standard approach makes it possible to find the four-momentum in covariant form only for a free point particle. In contrast, the obtained formulas for calculating the four-momentum components are applied to a stationary and moving relativistic uniform system, consisting of many particles. In this case, the main fields of the system under consideration are taken into account, including the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the acceleration field and the pressure field. The formalism used includes the principle of least action, charged and neutral four-currents, corresponding four-potentials and field tensors, which ensures unification and the possibility of combining fields into a single interaction. The calculation of the integral vector components shows that the so-called integral vector is not equal to four-momentum and is not a four-vector at all, although it is conserved in a closed system. Thus, the four-momentum cannot be found with the help of an integral vector and components of the system stress-energy tensor, in contrast to how it is assumed in the general theory of relativity.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Hilbert Envelopes on Motion Waveforms Detected in Vibrating Systems: An Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an axiomatic approach in the theory of energy dissipation in Hilbert envelopes on waveforms emanating from various vibrating systems. A Hilbert envelope is a curve tangent to peak points on a motion waveform. The basic approach is to compare non-modulated vs. modulated waveforms in measuring energy loss during the vibratory motion $m(t)$ at time $t$ of moving object such as a walker, runner or biker recorded in a video. Modulation of $m(t)$ is achieved by using Mersenne primes to adjust the frequency $\omega$ of the Euler exponential in $m(t)e^{\pm j2\pi \omega t}{\rm d}t$. Expediture of energy $E_{m(t)}$ by a system is measured in terms of the area bounded by the motion $m(t)$ waveform at time $t$.</description>
