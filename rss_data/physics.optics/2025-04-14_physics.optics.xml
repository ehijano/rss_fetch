      <title>Hybridization of edge modes with substrate phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.</description>

      <title>All Optical Echo State Network Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an innovative design for an all-optical Echo State Network (ESN), an advanced type of reservoir computer known for its universal computational capabilities. Our design enables fully optical implementation of arbitrary ESNs, featuring complete flexibility in optical matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation. Leveraging the nonlinear characteristics of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), the architecture efficiently realizes measurement-free operations crucial for reservoir computing. The approach significantly reduces computational overhead and energy consumption compared to traditional software-based methods. Comprehensive simulations validate the system's memory capacity, nonlinear processing strength, and polynomial algebra capabilities, showcasing performance comparable to software ESNs across key benchmark tasks. Our design establishes a feasible, scalable, and universally applicable framework for optical reservoir computing, suitable for diverse machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>High-brightness multimode fiber laser amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber lasers are widely used in various fields owing to their high efficiency, flexible transmission and excellent beam quality. In applications such as industrial manufacturing and defense systems, a higher output power is always desired. Nevertheless, the power scaling in fiber lasers is limited by nonlinear effects and transverse mode instability in conventional high-power fiber laser systems, where the laser is amplified within the fundamental fiber mode. A promising strategy to overcome these limitations is to utilize multimode fibers, which exhibit higher thresholds for both nonlinear effects and transverse mode instability, combined with wavefront shaping techniques to convert the output speckle pattern into a single concentrated spot. In this study, a high-power multimode fiber laser amplifier based on wavefront shaping is constructed and investigated, achieving a focused beam profile with a 168 W output power. The effects of objective function and the linewidth of seed laser on the system performance are also studied. Additionally, an all-fiber version of high-brightness multimode fiber laser amplifier is proposed. This work opens up new avenues for leveraging multimode fibers to achieve higher brightness in fiber lasers and may inspire other research based on wavefront shaping.</description>

      <title>Determination of the irreducible representations at high symmetry points of two-dimensional square lattice plasmonic crystals by far-field radiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the knowledge of the eigenmode symmetries at high symmetry points (HSPs) in the Brillouin zone is essential in studying the topological properties of electronic and electromagnetic systems, how one can acquire it precisely has become a subject of interest. Here, we employ temporal coupled mode theory (CMT) to determine the irreducible representations of the energy bands at the HSPs in 2D square lattice photonic systems. Our CMT on plasmonic nanohole arrays formulates how Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interact not only with each other and but also with the continuum, revealing the importance of mode coupling in defining the field symmetries as well as their radiative and nonradiative characteristics. Such formulation facilitates the assignments of the band representations. From the representations, we find, unlike the conventional 2D tight-binding model, several band inversions occur at the {\Gamma}and X points as hole size increases, leading to changes in band topology in a subtle manner. In addition, the radiations arising from the coupled SPPs that carry different field symmetries are strongly polarization- and phase-dependent. We then conduct angle- and polarization-resolved diffraction spectroscopy on plasmonic arrays to verify the theory. Our study paves a simple way toward the probing of the band topology of non-Hermitian systems via far-field.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Lineshape Analysis for Arbitrary Inhomogeneity in Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative lineshape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for the excitonic resonance in a GaAs quantum well with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative lineshape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Fano resonances induced by symmetry protected bound states in the continuum in dielectric metasurfaces: line-shape prediction by machine learning method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider resonances induced by symmetry protected bound states in the continuum in dielectric gratings with in-plane mirror symmetry. It is shown that the shape of the resonance in transmittance is controlled by two parameters in a generic formula which can be derived in the framework of the coupled mode theory. It is numerically demonstrated that the formula encompasses various line-shapes including asymmetric Fano, Lorentzian, and anti-Lorentzian resonances. It is confirmed that the transmittance zeros are always present even in the absence up-down symmetry. At the same time reflectance zeros are not generally present in the single mode approximation. It is found that the line-shapes of Fano resonances can be predicted to a good accuracy by the random forest machine learning method which outperforms the standard least square methods approximation in error by an order of magnitude in error with the training dataset size $N\approx 10^4$.</description>

      <title>Active stabilization for ultralong acquisitions in an attosecond pump-probe beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond time-resolution experiments using noncollinear interferometers require precise and active control of the optical delay to prevent instabilities - including both slow drifts and rapid vibrations - that can obscure the time evolution of the physical system under investigation. In this work, we present the design and results of stability measurements for a double interferometer setup for extreme ultraviolet-infrared pump-probe spectroscopy. The attosecond pump-probe setup is driven by a high-average-power, high-repetition-rate laser system and offers sub-optical-cycle (+/-81 as) stability with a fast feedback rate over extended periods (up to several days). Due to the noncollinear arrangement, the setup enables independent control of both amplitude and phase in the two arms even across significantly different spectral regions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate attosecond beating in angle-resolved photoemission during two-photon, two-color photoionization, highlighting the broad potential of the system for kinematically and dynamically complete studies of atomic-scale light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Detection with Nanopillar Photonic Crystal Biosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of drugs able to mitigate neurodegenerative diseases has created an urgent need for novel diagnostics. Although biomarker detection directly in patients' blood is now possible, low-cost point-of-care tests remain a challenge, because relevant biomarkers, especially amyloid-\beta (A$\beta$) peptides, are small, they occur at very low concentrations, and detecting a single marker is insufficient. Here, we introduce an optical biosensor based on a nanopillar structure that employs a gold nanoparticle amplification strategy. The sensor is able to detect 20 pg/ml of A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 in undiluted serum, which is the clinically required level. We also show the detection of the A$\beta$42/A$\beta$40 ratio in the same channel, which is highly relevant for assessing disease progress and opens a route towards multiplexing. Alongside their simplicity and portability, these nanotechnology innovations make a major contribution to the ability to detect and monitor the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Refractive Indices and Birefringence of Undoped and MgO-Doped Lithium Niobate Crystals at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lithium niobate single crystal is a well-known optical material that has been employed in a wide range of photonic applications. To realize further applications of the crystal, the birefringence properties need to be determined over a large range of temperatures. We report refractive indices and birefringence properties of undoped and MgO-doped lithium niobate crystals with high accuracy using spectroscopic ellipsometry in the spectral range from 450 to 1700 nm and a temperature range from ambient temperature to 1000 {\deg}C. The birefringence results indicate a transition temperature, where the crystal transforms from an anisotropic to isotropic property, and the advance of MgO doping in the crystal, which is related to the optical damage threshold of the materials. In addition, the lattice dynamics of the crystals have been analyzed by revisiting the Raman spectroscopy. The results establish the foundation of optical properties of lithium niobate crystals, providing pathways for their photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency-bin interferometry for reconstructing electric fields with low intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast single-photon pulses with tailored time-frequency properties are highly attractive for quantum information science, offering high-dimensional encoding and compatibility with integrated optics platforms. However, accurate characterization of such pulses, including spectral coherence, remains challenging because current methods require substantial experimental resources and complex reconstruction algorithms. Here, we introduce frequency-bin interferometry for reconstructing electric fields with low intensity (FIREFLY), a technique that directly provides spectral amplitude, phase, and coherence profiles of single-photon pulses without requiring intensive reconstruction algorithms. Our approach measures the two-point spectral correlation function of the pulse by interfering its different frequency components using a quantum pulse gate (QPG) driven by a reference pump pulse. We demonstrate its compatibility with quantum light by characterizing partially coherent pulses generated by a type-0 parametric down-conversion process. We also overcome this requirement of a known pump pulse by introducing spectral shear into our interferometric scheme using a multi-output QPG (mQPG). This enables simultaneous characterization of a single-photon-level input pulse alongside an unknown pump pulse. Notably, our method achieves theory-experiment similarity above 95\% across all retrieved profiles, which demonstrates the reliability of this scheme for quantum information applications based on time-frequency encodings.</description>

      <title>Optical vortex trajectories as probes for wavefront aberrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase singularities, due to their high sensitivity to phase disturbances, are a promising tool for wavefront retrieval. Several methods have been proposed to exploit this property, one of which analyzes their trajectories (paths that singular points follow when shifted off-axis). Nevertheless, the relations between primary aberrations and trajectories remain unexploited. In this work, we aimed to address this gap by investigating how distinct aberrations influence vortex trajectory behavior. We performed numerical simulations of vortex trajectories under manually introduced aberrations and proposed metrics to describe their relationship. Our results show that defocus, coma, and astigmatism each produce a unique trajectory response, allowing differentiation between aberration types present in the beam. We proposed and experimentally validated an autofocusing algorithm that leverages the trajectory shape to identify the back focal plane of the optical system. This work presents a comprehensive study of optical vortex trajectories to further advance wavefront sensing based on phase singularities.</description>

      <title>Ising machine by dimensional collapse of nonlinear polarization oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines show promise as ultrafast hardware for optimizations encoded in Ising Hamiltonians but fall short in terms of success rate and performance scaling. Here, we propose a novel Ising machine that exploits the three-dimensional nature of nonlinear polarization oscillators to counteract these limitations. Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in third-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising ground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the Poincar\'e sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed points mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of polarization-modulated pulses in a $\chi^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative feedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads to an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential improvement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines. The proposed polarization Ising machine paves the way for a new class of Ising solvers with enhanced computing capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method for More Precise Pulse-Height Fitting in Sparsely Sampled Data Using Pulse-Shape-Archetype Information, Especially Suited to Ultra-Short-Laser Pulsetrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pulse-reconstruction method well suited to sparsely sampled repetitive data, such as commonly arise from trains of ultrashort laser-pulses. Typically waveforms in such traces are fully instrument-limited by the detecting systems, for instance, the combination of detector and oscilloscope, and only the energy of each waveform is sought. The method applies whenever shape of the waveform is the same for every pulse and can be well-characterized, with only amplitude and relative peak-timing changing. Under such conditions this information, known in advance, can be used as a basis - an archetype - for very accurate pulse fitting. Our characterizations show that the method very accurately extracts pulse heights and relative pulse timing, even when sampling routinely misses the pulse peak, and entirely misses the rising or falling edge. We show this method to be adaptable in different detection systems, showing significant improvement in accuracy of measurement, in this class of problem.</description>

Abstract: In ultrafast experiments with gas phase molecules, the alignment of the molecular axis relative to the polarization of the interacting laser pulses plays a crucial role in determining the dynamics following this light-matter interaction. The molecular axis distribution is influenced by the interacting pulses and is intrinsically linked to the electronic coherences of the excited molecules. However, in typical theoretical calculations of such interactions, the signal is either calculated for a single molecule in the molecular frame or averaged over all possible molecular orientations to compare with the experiment. This averaging leads to the loss of information about anisotropy in the molecular-axis distribution, which could significantly affect the measured experimental signal. Here, we calculate the laboratory frame transient electronic first-order polarization ($P^{(1)}$) spectra in terms of separated molecular frame and laboratory frame quantities. The laboratory frame polarizations are compared with orientation-averaged Quantum Master Equation (QME) calculations, demonstrating that orientation-averaging captures only the isotropic contributions. We show that our formalism allows us to also evaluate the anisotropic contributions to the spectrum. Finally, we discuss the application of this approach to achieve ultrafast quantum state tomography using transient absorption spectroscopy and field observables in nonlinear spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Oblique diffraction geometry for the observation of several non-coplanar Bragg reflections under identical illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to determine the strain tensor and local lattice rotation with Dark Field X-ray Microscopy. Using a set of at least 3 non-coplanar, symmetry-equivalent Bragg reflections, the illuminated volume of the sample can be kept constant for all reflections, facilitating easy registration of the measured lattice variations. This requires an oblique diffraction geometry, i.e.~the diffraction plane is neither horizontal nor vertical. We derive a closed, analytical expression that allows determination of the strain and lattice rotation from the deviation of experimental observables (e.g.~goniometer angles) from their nominal position for an unstrained lattice.</description>

      <title>Coherent Nonlinear Optical Response for High-Intensity Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculation of the coherent nonlinear response of a system is essential to correctly interpret results from advanced techniques such as two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS). Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a $\delta$-function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. Additionally, we present simulation results that replicate previously-reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signal, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Casimir Force Softening Originated from Quantum Surface Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</description>

      <title>End-to-end design of multicolor scintillators for enhanced energy resolution in X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scintillators have been widely used in X-ray imaging due to their ability to convert high-energy radiation into visible light, making them essential for applications such as medical imaging and high-energy physics. Recent advances in the artificial structuring of scintillators offer new opportunities for improving the energy resolution of scintillator-based X-ray detectors. Here, we present a three-bin energy-resolved X-ray imaging framework based on a three-layer multicolor scintillator used in conjunction with a physics-aware image postprocessing algorithm. The multicolor scintillator is able to preserve X-ray energy information through the combination of emission wavelength multiplexing and energy-dependent isolation of X-ray absorption in specific layers. The dominant emission color and the radius of the spot measured by the detector are used to infer the incident X-ray energy based on prior knowledge of the energy-dependent absorption profiles of the scintillator stack. Through ab initio Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our approach can achieve an energy reconstruction accuracy of 49.7%, which is only 2% below the maximum accuracy achievable with realistic scintillators. We apply our framework to medical phantom imaging simulations where we demonstrate that it can effectively differentiate iodine and gadolinium-based contrast agents from bone, muscle, and soft tissue.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Reverberant Shear Waves for Assessing Tissue Dispersion in Optical Coherence Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity. Accurate characterization of viscoelastic properties requires estimating shear wave speed (SWS) across multiple frequencies, as dispersion induces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This study introduces a novel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance viscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave dynamics over multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and validation of MFR-OCE through simulations and experiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine cornea, and ex vivo bovine liver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS with errors below 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that MFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates, with differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion coefficients extracted from biological tissues and phantoms align with the theoretical viscoelastic power law model. The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low viscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power law fit of SWS, while the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic behavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant frequency dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings demonstrate that MFR-OCE enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue mechanics and holds the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.</description>
