      <title>Metric complexity is a Bryant--Tupper diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric complexity (sometimes called Leinster--Cobbold maximum diversity) of a compact metric space is a recently introduced isometry-invariant of compact metric spaces which generalizes the notion of cardinality, and can be thought of as a metric-sensitive analogue of maximum entropy. On the other hand, the notion of diversity introduced by Bryant and Tupper is an assignment of a real number to every finite subset of a fixed set, which generalizes the notion of a metric. We establish a connection between these concepts by showing that the former quantity naturally produces an example of the latter. Moreover, in contrast to several examples in the literature, the diversity that arises from metric complexity is Minkowski-superlinear for compact subsets of the real line.</description>

      <title>The Maximum of the Volume of a Cevian Simplex and its Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the area of the cevian triangle for an interior point $M$ of a triangle $\gamma$ is at most $\frac{1}{4}$ of the area of the triangle $\gamma$. This can be generalized for $n$-dimensional simplex $A_1A_2\ldots A_{n+1}$ using the concept of barycentric coordinates. The method also helps with the solution of a new optimization problem for the volume of the simplex $MN_1\ldots N_{n}$, where $N_1,\ldots ,N_{n}$ are the intersection points of the lines $A_iM$ with the opposite hyperplanes of the simplex $A_1A_2\ldots A_{n+1}$. This generalizes the recently considered special cases $n=2$ and $n=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-term relations of the form AB+CD=EF arise in multiple mathematical contexts, including the Ptolemy equation for a cyclic quadrilateral, Casey's theorem on bitangents, Penner's relation for lambda lengths, and Pl\"ucker's identity for the maximal minors of a 2x4-matrix. In this note, we explain how these different occurrences of the 3-term relation can be directly obtained from each other.</description>

      <title>On integer points inside a randomly shifted polyhedron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a convex body $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Let $X$ be a random point with uniform distribution in $[0,1]^d$. Define $X_C$ as the number of lattice points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ inside the translated body $C + X$. It is well known that $\mathbb{E} X_C = \mathrm{vol}(C)$. A natural question arises: What can be said about the distribution of $X_C$ in general? In this work, we study this question when $C$ is a polyhedron with vertices at integer points.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of real algebraic maps into curves with prescribed Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. %This can be contribut\ed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters: The Analysis Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a matrix that encodes pairwise distances in a finite metric space (or, more generally, the edge weight matrix of a network) under the barycentric coding model (BCM) with respect to the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance function. We frame this task as estimating the unknown barycentric coordinates with respect to the GW distance, assuming that the target matrix (or kernel) belongs to the set of GW barycenters of a finite collection of known templates. In the language of harmonic analysis, if computing GW barycenters can be viewed as a synthesis problem, this paper aims to solve the corresponding analysis problem. We propose two methods: one utilizing fixed-point iteration for computing GW barycenters, and another employing a differentiation-based approach to the GW structure using a blow-up technique. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed GW analysis approach in a series of numerical experiments and applications to machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a smooth connected manifold, we consider all possible locally elliptic and locally bounded measurable coefficient Riemannian metrics called rough Riemannian metrics. We equip this set with an extended metric which is connected if and only if the manifold is compact. We prove that this is a complete length extended metric space and the components on which the distance is finite are path-connected. Moreover, we identify the closure of smooth metrics in this space to be continuous metrics.</description>

      <title>Deltahedral Domes over Equiangular Polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polyiamond is a polygon composed of unit equilateral triangles, and a generalized deltahedron is a convex polyhedron whose every face is a convex polyiamond. We study a variant where one face may be an exception. For a convex polygon P, if there is a convex polyhedron that has P as one face and all the other faces are convex polyiamonds, then we say that P can be domed. Our main result is a complete characterization of which equiangular n-gons can be domed: only if n is in {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12}, and only with some conditions on the integer edge lengths.</description>

      <title>The Kneser--Poulsen phenomena for entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow. An inequality that unifies Costa's result on the concavity of entropy power with the entropic Kneser--Poulsen theorem is also presented.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the decay of the Laplace-Polya integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laplace--P\'olya integral, defined by $J_n(r) = \frac1\pi\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}^n t \cos(rt) \mathrm{d} \, t$, appears in several areas of mathematics. We study this quantity by combinatorial methods; accordingly, our investigation focuses on the values at integer $r$'s. Our main result establishes a lower bound for the ratio $\frac{J_n(r+2)}{J_n(r)}$ which extends and generalises the previous estimates of Lesieur and Nicolas, and provides a natural counterpart to the upper estimate established in our previous work. We derive the statement by purely combinatorial, elementary arguments. As a corollary, we deduce that no subdiagonal central sections of the unit cube are extremal, apart from the minimal, maximal, and the main diagonal sections. We also prove several consequences for Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For uniformly dicrete metric spaces without bounded geometry we suggest a modified version of property A based on metrics of bounded geometry greater than the given metric. We show that this version still implies coarse embeddability in Hilbert spaces, and that some examples of non-property A spaces of unbounded geometry satisfy this version. We also relate this version of property A to our version of uniform Roe algebras for spaces without bounded geometry and introduce an appropriate equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>The Weighted $L^p$ Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem in convex geometry concerns showing a given Borel measure on the unit sphere is, up to perhaps a constant, some type of surface area measure of a convex body. Two types of Minkowski problems in particular are an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak and (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by Livshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary investigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work, we consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework going beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures, mirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for rotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for all $p \in \mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also have uniqueness for $p \geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain results in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as instigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for the Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Dimension for Autonomous Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a curvature-dimension condition for autonomous Lagrangians on weighted manifolds, which depends on the Euler-Lagrange dynamics on a single energy level. By generalizing Klartag's needle decomposition technique to the Lagrangian setting, we prove that this curvature-dimension condition is equivalent to displacement convexity of entropy along cost-minimizing interpolations in an $L^1$ sense, and that it implies various consequences of lower Ricci curvature bounds, as in the metric setting. As examples we consider classical and isotropic Lagrangians on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we generalize the horocyclic Brunn-Minkowski inequality to complex hyperbolic space of arbitrary dimension, and present a new Brunn-Minkowski inequality for contact magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres.</description>

Abstract: The Hausdorff dimension of a set can be detected using the Riesz energy. Here, we consider situations where a sequence of points, $\{x_n\}$, ``fills in'' a set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in an appropriate sense and investigate the degree to which the discrete analog to the Riesz energy of these sets can be used to bound the Hausdorff dimension of $E$. We also discuss applications to data science and Erd\H{o}s/Falconer type problems.</description>
