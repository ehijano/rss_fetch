      <title>Particle Identification with the ePIC detector at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ePIC detector is being designed as a general-purpose detector to deliver the full physics program of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) in BNL USA. Particle Identification (PID) plays a crucial role in the EIC physics program. Over a wide phase-space the PID systems provide excellent hadron identification required for the EIC physics program. Additionally, the PID systems have to provide low momentum electron-pion separation to support the calorimeter performance. The ePIC experiment employs different advanced PID technologies to reach the physics goals. The compact set-up the collider and the presence of high magnetic field of the experimental solenoid impose numerous technical challenges. In this article we will describe the PID subsystems of the ePIC detector, with a specific emphasis on high momentum PID system using RICH technology. The article will report about the studies performed with SiPMs as the photo-sensor candidate for forward RICH detector. Also, studies made with novel LAPPD detectors and standard MCP- PMTs chosen as baseline photo-sensor candidates for the backward RICH and barrel DIRC system respectively. This article will include a discussion on the simulation studies made with stand-alone Geant4 simulations and official ePIC software framework.</description>

      <title>Neural rendering enables dynamic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interrupted X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) has been the common way to observe the deformation of materials during an experiment. While this approach is effective for quasi-static experiments, it has never been possible to reconstruct a full 3d tomography during a dynamic experiment which cannot be interrupted. In this work, we propose that neural rendering tools can be used to drive the paradigm shift to enable 3d reconstruction during dynamic events. First, we derive theoretical results to support the selection of projections angles. Via a combination of synthetic and experimental data, we demonstrate that neural radiance fields can reconstruct data modalities of interest more efficiently than conventional reconstruction methods. Finally, we develop a spatio-temporal model with spline-based deformation field and demonstrate that such model can reconstruct the spatio-temporal deformation of lattice samples in real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the S1 triplet component in the DarkSide-50 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DarkSide-50 (DS-50) experiment aims at the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles. It is a dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr TPC) where Dark Matter (DM), which constitutes five sixths of all matter in the universe, is expected to interact with an argon nucleus resulting in a nuclear recoil. A scintillation signal (S1) is produced as a result of the ionising events from the DM-Ar interaction. The impurities in LAr, such as $\text{O}_2, \text{N}_2, \text{H}_2\text{O}$, etc., at the ppm level, quench the scintillation photons, leading to a reduction in the observed lifetime of the triplet state. In this contribution, the effect of impurities on the triplet lifetime is analyzed for individual events using DS-50 data, with a primary focus on nitrogen, one of the candidates for the impurities in LAr hypothesized to cause a suppression of triplet lifetime. This is done by determining the lifetime of the triplet component with a known purity, which can be used as a reference for the purity level of argon used in current and future dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Detection of $^{135}$Cs &amp; $^{137}$Cs in environmental samples by AMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of low abundances of $^{135}$Cs in environmental samples is of significant interest in different fields of environmental sciences, especially in combination with its shorter-lived sister isotope $^{137}$Cs. The method of Ion-Laser InterAction Mass Spectrometry (ILIAMS) for barium separation at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) was investigated and further improved for low abundance cesium detection. The difluorides BaF$_2^-$ and CsF$_2^-$ differ in their electron detachment energies and make isobar suppression with ILIAMS by more than 7 orders of magnitude possible. By this method, samples with ratios down to the order of $^{135,137}$Cs/$^{133}$Cs $\approx 10^{-11}$ are measurable and the $^{135}$Cs/$^{137}$Cs ratios of first environmental samples were determined by AMS.</description>

      <title>Large-area photonic circuits for terahertz detection and beam profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deployment of terahertz communication and spectroscopy systems relies on the availability of low-noise and fast detectors, with plug-and-play capabilities. However, most currently available technologies are stand-alone, discrete components, either slow or susceptible to temperature drifts. Moreover, phase-sensitive schemes are mainly based on bulk crystals and require tight beam focusing. Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic architecture in thin-film lithium niobate that addresses these challenges by exploiting the electro-optic modulation induced by a terahertz signal onto an optical beam at telecom frequencies. Leveraging on the low optical losses provided by this platform, we integrate a double array of up to 18 terahertz antennas within a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, considerably extending the device collection area and boosting the interaction efficiency between the terahertz signal and the optical beam. We show that the double array coherently builds up the probe modulation through a mechanism of quasi-phase-matching, driven by a periodic terahertz near-field pattern, without physical inversion of the crystallographic domains. The array periodicity controls the detection bandwidth and its central frequency, while the large detection area ensures correct operation with diverse terahertz beam settings. Furthermore, we show that the antennas act as pixels that allow reconstruction of the terahertz beam profile impinging on the detector area. Our on-chip design in thin-film lithium niobate overcomes the detrimental effects of two-photon absorption and fixed phase-matching conditions, which have plagued previously explored electro-optic detection systems, especially in the telecom band, paving the way for more advanced on-chip terahertz systems.</description>

      <title>Architectural Solutions for High-Speed Data Processing Demands of CERN LHC Detectors with FPGA and High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planned high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will bring much higher data rates that are far above the capabilities of currently installed software-based data processing systems. Therefore, new methods must be used to facilitate on-the-fly extraction of scientifically significant information from the immense flow of data produced by LHC particle detectors. This paper focuses on implementation of a tau lepton triggering algorithm in FPGA. Due to the algorithm's complexity and strict technical requirements, its implementation in FPGA fabric becomes a particularly challenging task. The paper presents a study of algorithm development with the help of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) technique that can generate hardware description from C++ code. Various architectural solutions and optimizations that were tried out during the design architecture exploration process are also discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Lossless photon flux sensing methodology for EUV and Soft X-ray metrology systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple, lossless method for monitoring photon flux in short-wavelength metrology systems, with a particular focus on applications using high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources. In HHG-based metrology, where photon scarcity often limits precision and efficiency, the ability to monitor flux without sacrificing photons is critical. This demonstrated approach measures a photon-induced current in a metallic EUV filter, generated by primary and secondary electrons released via the photoelectric effect during exposure to high-energy photons. By integrating this current over a set exposure period, we obtain a build-up charge directly correlated with the incident photon flux. This measurement provides a reliable, real-time indicator of photon flux, allowing for precise normalization in metrology experiments without introducing additional optical losses. The method leverages any conductive component that are typically present in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) metrology setups, making it a cost-effective and straightforward addition to existing systems.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the response function of the PIENU NaI(T$\ell$) and CsI crystal calorimeter using a monochromatic 70 MeV/c positron beam at various incidence angles are described. The experimental setup and relevant physical processes involved were simulated using Geant4 to reproduce positron energy spectra. Monte Carlo simulations were compared with experimental data across ten calorimeter-beam angles and showed good agreement. This allowed the validation of simulation parameters that were essential for precise measurements of pion decays.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Reliability Characterizing Systematic Errors in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing utilize quantum effects, such as entanglement and coherence, to measure physical signals. The performance of a sensing process is characterized by error which requires comparison to a true value. However, in practice, such a true value might be inaccessible. In this study, we utilize quantum reliability as a metric to evaluate quantum sensor's performance based solely on the apparatus itself, without any prior knowledge of true value. We derive a general relationship among reliability, sensitivity, and systematic error, and demonstrate this relationship using a typical quantum sensing process. That is to measure magnetic fields (as a signal) by a spin-$1/2$ particle and using the Stern-Gerlach apparatus to read out the signal information. Our findings illustrate the application of quantum reliability in quantum sensing, opening new perspectives for reliability analysis in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Calculation of Pulse Shape Discrimination Based on Photoelectron Quantity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) is a widely used technique in many experimental analysis. In this study, we specifically aimed to assess the effectiveness of PSD in accurately measuring decay time. We measured the decay times of a 0.1 wt% Gd-loaded liquid scintillator (Gd-LS) with 5 vol% Ultimagold-F added when irradiated with neutrons and gamma rays, which were emitted from a Cf-252 radiation source, using a two-exponential decay model. We distinguished between gamma-like events and neutron-like events using the time-of-flight difference. Based on the measured decay times, we developed a simulation to model the waveforms. In the sim-ulation, we adjusted the number of photoelectrons (NPE) and generated waveforms for NPE ranging from 10 to 1000 photoelectrons. We investigated the pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance as a function of NPE photoelectrons (PE) and determined that at least 49 PE is required for a neutron-like events rejection efficiency of 90%, while keeping gamma-like events 97.8%.</description>

      <title>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic separation of pump and signal tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of $\sim2000$, we measured a peak signal gain of $15\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst achieving pump separation of $12\,\mathrm{dB}$. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be $0.15\,\mathrm{dB}$ over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at $3.2\,\mathrm{K}$ and achieved a peak signal gain of $11\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst having a pump separation factor of $10.5\,\mathrm{dB}$. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider is preparing for an upgrade after 2027-2028 to handle higher luminosity and increased background rates. A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) has been identified as a potential candidate for a common front-end upgrade for subsystems requiring high-speed waveform digitization. The RFSoC's ADC and DAC channels were tested across various magnetic field strengths and a few different field orientations. Power consumption and boot memory functionality were also assessed. Results indicate stable operation with negligible performance degradation, suggesting the RFSoC's viability for high-speed digitization tasks in high magnetic field environments.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurement of the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ at future Higgs factories, including ILC, is of crucial importance for the cross-section measurements, and in particular for the line-shape measurements at the Z-pole. Since there is no up-to-date estimate of the integrated luminosity uncertainties arising from metrology effects at ILC, here we review the metrology requirements for the targeted precision of $\mathcal{L}$ at foreseen ILC center-of-mass energies: 91.2 GeV, 250 GeV, 500 GeV and 1 TeV, using small-angle Bhabha scattering.</description>

      <title>Digital stabilization of an IQ modulator in the carrier suppressed single side-band (CS-SSB) mode for atom interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>
