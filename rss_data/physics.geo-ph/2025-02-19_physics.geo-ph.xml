      <title>Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Geophysical Insights for Earthquake Forecasting: A Cross-Disciplinary Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake forecasting remains a significant scientific challenge, with current methods falling short of achieving the performance necessary for meaningful societal benefits. Traditional models, primarily based on past seismicity and geomechanical data, struggle to capture the complexity of seismic patterns and often overlook valuable non-seismic precursors such as geophysical, geochemical, and atmospheric anomalies. The integration of such diverse data sources into forecasting models, combined with advancements in AI technologies, offers a promising path forward. AI methods, particularly deep learning, excel at processing complex, large-scale datasets, identifying subtle patterns, and handling multidimensional relationships, making them well-suited for overcoming the limitations of conventional approaches.
  This review highlights the importance of combining AI with geophysical knowledge to create robust, physics-informed forecasting models. It explores current AI methods, input data types, loss functions, and practical considerations for model development, offering guidance to both geophysicists and AI researchers. While many AI-based studies oversimplify earthquake prediction, neglecting critical features such as data imbalance and spatio-temporal clustering, the integration of specialized geophysical insights into AI models can address these shortcomings.
  We emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, urging geophysicists to experiment with AI architectures thoughtfully and encouraging AI experts to deepen their understanding of seismology. By bridging these disciplines, we can develop more accurate, reliable, and societally impactful earthquake forecasting tools.</description>

      <title>Seismological study of meta-instability of the Yangbi $M_S$ 6.4 earthquake in 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-instability is an irreversible precursor of earthquakes. To identify the meta-instability precursor of the Yangbi $M_S$ 6.4 earthquake ($99.87^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$, $25.67^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$)that occurred on May 21, 2021, we selected seismic data from the pre-earthquake period between 1 and 21 May. We then calculated the apparent wave velocity ratio and the apparent Poisson\text{'}s ratio within the region of $98.5^{\circ} \mathrm{E}-101^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$, $24.6^{\circ}\mathrm{N}-27.1^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ and interpolated these values. Our findings revealed that the trends of the fitted straight lines at the maximum and minimum points of the gradient divergences of the apparent wave velocity ratio and apparent Poisson\text{'}s ratio fields are consistent with the source mechanism solution for Sections 1 and 2, respectively. Similarly, the trend of the fitted straight lines at the minimum and maximum points of their values is also consistent with the source mechanism solution for Sections 1 and 2. Positive gradient divergence values indicate energy released, whereas negative values suggest energy absorption. The observed stress state matches the experimentally demonstrated meta-instable state. We propose that this method can be a reference for identifying the meta-instability of strike-slip strong earthquakes with a significant number of foreshocks. For seismically active regions, increasing the number of stations with rich data acquisition will facilitate more convenient stress field analysis.</description>

      <title>Extending the Width of Short Aperture Data by Data-Driven Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that it is infeasible to estimate the phase velocity of a surface wave with a recording aperture less than $\lambda/2$ in length, where $\lambda$ is the horizontal wavelength of the propagating wave. We show both theoretically and computationally that the width of the recording aperture can be extended using the recorded data at longer time intervals. This leads to more reliable estimates of apparent velocities for both body waves and surface waves. Here, we assume single-mode plane waves sweeping across the recording array with a linear moveout.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Thin Section Image Processing for Pore-Throat Characterization in Tight Clastic Rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of pore-throat structures in tight sandstones is crucial for understanding fluid flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs and groundwater systems. Both thin-section and Mercury Intrusion Capillary Pressure (MICP) offer insights rock petrophysical parameters. However, thin-section analysis is limited by its 2D nature and subjective interpretation, while MICP provides 3D pore-throat distributions, it lacks direct visualization of pore morphology. This study evaluates AI-assisted thin-section image analysis for pore-throat characterization by comparing its results to MICP-derived measurements. A machine learning-based workflow was developed using color thresholding, K-Means clustering, and medial axis transformation to segment pore structures in thin-section images. Throat width, porosity, and permeability were quantitatively assessed against MICP to determine the accuracy and reliability of the technique. The analysis of 26 sandstone samples outlined differences between the two methods. Thin-section analysis showed porosity values from 1.37% to 53.37%, with average pore-throat sizes between 5.63 micron and 30.09 micron, while permeability estimates ranged from 0.01 mD to 344.35 mD. Correlation analysis showed moderate agreement for throat size (r=0.62) and permeability (r=0.61), but weaker for porosity (r=0.32), highlighting the differences in how each method captures pore connectivity. Results demonstrate that the AI-assisted segmentation provides a scalable and reproducible approach but is constrained by thin-section imaging resolution. While MICP remains reliable for permeability evaluation, its comparison with AI-driven image analysis helps assess the reliability of the method. Future research should refine segmentation algorithms, incorporate pretrained data to validate AI-derived pore-throat attributes for improved reservoir quality assessment and predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Explaining Earthquake-Induced Liquefaction Potential through Multi-Modal Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents an explainable parallel transformer architecture for soil liquefaction prediction that integrates three distinct data streams: spectral seismic encoding, soil stratigraphy tokenization, and site-specific features. The architecture processes data from 165 case histories across 11 major earthquakes, employing Fast Fourier Transform for seismic waveform encoding and principles from large language models for soil layer tokenization. Interpretability is achieved through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which decompose predictions into individual contributions from seismic characteristics, soil properties, and site conditions. The model achieves 93.75% prediction accuracy on cross-regional validation sets and demonstrates robust performance through sensitivity analysis of ground motion intensity and soil resistance parameters. Notably, validation against previously unseen ground motion data from the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake confirms the model's generalization capabilities and practical utility. Implementation as a publicly accessible web application enables rapid assessment of multiple sites simultaneously. This approach establishes a new framework in geotechnical deep learning where sophisticated multi-modal analysis meets practical engineering requirements through quantitative interpretation and accessible deployment.</description>
