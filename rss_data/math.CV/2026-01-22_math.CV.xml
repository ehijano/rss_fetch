      <title>Value Distribution and Picard-type Theorems for Total Differential Polynomials in $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the value distribution and growth properties of linear total differential polynomials $\mathcal{L}_k[D]f$ for meromorphic functions in several complex variables $\mathbb{C}^n$. By extending the classical Milloux inequality to the framework of total derivatives, we derive a series of fundamental growth estimates for the Nevanlinna characteristic function $T(r, \mathcal{L}_k[D]f)$. We address the value-sharing problem for meromorphic functions $f$ and $g$ sharing values with their differential polynomials. Under the condition $2\delta(0,f)+(k+4)\Theta(\infty,f)&gt;k+5$, we establish that $\frac{\mathcal{L}_k[D]f-1}{\mathcal{L}_k[D]g-1}$ is a non-zero constant for non-transcendental meromorphic functions. Furthermore, we provide an affirmative answer to several Picard-type inquiries, proving that if an entire function $f$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ omits a value $a$ while its linear total differential polynomial $\mathcal{L}_k[D]f$ omits a non-zero value $b$, then $f$ must be constant. Our results generalize and extend several existing uniqueness and Picard-type theorems from the classical one-variable setting to the higher-dimensional complex space $\mathbb{C}^n$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-visual approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the foundations of the theory of quasi-visual approximations of bounded metric spaces. Roughly speaking, these are sequences of covers of a given space for which the diameters of the sets in the covers shrink to zero and for which relative metric quantities (such as ratios of diameters and distances) are uniformly controlled. This framework has applications to questions in quasiconformal geometry. In particular, quasi-visual approximations can be used to detect whether a given homeomorphism between two bounded metric spaces is a quasisymmetry.
  We also explore the connection to the theory of Gromov hyperbolic spaces via the tile graph associated with a quasi-visual approximation. As an application, we relate these ideas to the dynamics of semi-hyperbolic rational maps. More specifically, we show that the Julia set of a rational map admits a dynamical quasi-visual approximation if and only if the map is semi-hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Planar Harmonic Mappings on the Lebesgue Measure of Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of planar univalent harmonic mappings on the Lebesgue measure of measurable sets in the complex plane. Motivated by Problem 3.25 of Koh and Kovalev (HQM2010), we establish sharp quantitative area distortion inequalities for disks and for arbitrary measurable sets under sense-preserving harmonic self-maps of the unit disk. Using the area formula and the canonical decomposition of harmonic mappings, we derive bounds in terms of the Jacobian and the dilatation, and we identify rigidity phenomena characterizing equality. In particular, we prove global area contraction for disks, star-shaped sets, and sufficiently small sets, and we refine the results using Hardy space methods to obtain sharp bounds with equality only for conformal automorphisms. Extremal affine and non-affine examples illustrate the sharpness of our estimates. Our results provide a complete, rigorous, and strengthened solution to Problem 3.25 and highlight several natural conjectures on global area contraction, extremal distortion, and rigidity for harmonic mappings.</description>

      <title>On the Bergman metric of symmettric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bounded domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ whose Bergman metric is locally symmetric, i.e. its Riemannian curvature tensor is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. Following the strategy developed in \cite{UnifThm2}, we obtain two rigidity results. If the Bergman metric of $\Omega$ is complete, then $\Omega$ is (globally) symmetric. If instead $\Omega$ is pseudoconvex, then $\Omega$ is biholomorphic to $\widetilde\Omega\setminus E$, where $\widetilde\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ is a bounded symmetric domain and $E\subset\widetilde\Omega$ is relatively closed and pluripolar. The proofs combine the structure theory of Hermitian symmetric spaces with Calabi's theory of K\"ahler immersions into the infinite dimensional complex projective space (in particular, rigidity and the hereditary property of the diastasis), together with analytic and pluripotential tools based on extension properties of square-integrable holomorphic functions and the Bergman kernel.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Schur-class functions on the bidisk and Schur-class functions on the symmetrized bidisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present some thoughts on the relation between symmetric Schur-class functions on the bidisk and Schur-class functions on the symmetrized bidisk. Among other things, use of this relation leads to a finite dimensional realization result for rational matrix functions in the Schur-class on the symmetrized bidisk and also to a determinantal representation result for polynomials without zeros on the symmetrized bidisk.</description>

      <title>Random infinite ideal angled graphs and ideal hyperbolic polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to develop the uniformization and boundary theory of random infinite ideal hyperbolic polyhedra (abbr. IHP) and their dual 1-skeleton, i.e., ideal angled graphs (abbr. IAG) from multiple perspectives, including combinatorics, geometry, analysis and random walks. For unimodular random IAG, we establish an ICP analog of the dichotomy theorem of Angel-Hutchcroft-Nachmias-Ray [4,5]. Specifically, the character $T(\rho):=\sum_{e\ni\rho}\Theta_e$ of an IAG, introduced in [40], determines its ICP type: the graph is a.s. ICP-parabolic if and only if $\mathbb{E}[T(\rho)]=2\pi$. In the ICP-hyperbolic case, the simple random walk converges a.s. to $\partial\mathbb{D}$ with positive hyperbolic speed. Moreover, the geometric, Poisson, Martin, and Gromov boundaries coincide, extending the boundary theory of Angel-Barlow-Gurevich-Nachmias [3] and Hutchcroft-Peres [37] beyond triangulations to cellular decompositions. As a corollary of the aforementioned IHP/IAG duality, we obtain the systematic characterizations of the random IHP. To develop our theory, we strengthen and refine the Ring Lemma of Ge-Yu-Zhou [27] for ICP, which provides quantitative local control of the packing geometry. This key estimate makes it possible to extend the boundary theory beyond triangulations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the modulus of continuity of solutions to Dirichlet problems for complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations with $L^p$ densities on Stein spaces with isolated singularities. In particular, we prove such solutions are H\"older continuous outside singular points if the boundary data is H\"older continuous.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Deformations of Hyperbolicity Notions on Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate deformation properties of balanced hyperbolicity, with particular emphasis on degenerate balanced manifolds and their behavior under modifications.
  In this context, we introduce two new notions of hyperbolicity for compact non-K\"ahler manifolds $X$ of complex dimension $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}X=n$ in degree $1 \leq p \leq n-1$, inspired by the work of F. Haggui and S. Marouani on $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity. The first notion, called \emph{p-SKT hyperbolicity}, generalizes the notions of SKT hyperbolicity and Gauduchon hyperbolicity introduced by S. Marouani. The second notion, called \emph{p-HS hyperbolicity}, extends the notion of sG hyperbolicity defined by Y. Ma.
  We investigate the relationship between these notions of analytic nature and their geometric counterparts, namely Kobayashi hyperbolicity and \emph{p-cyclic hyperbolicity} for $2 \leq p \leq n-1$, and we examine the openness under holomorphic deformations of both $p$-HS hyperbolicity and $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Ray structures on Teichm\"uller Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there may be many Thurston metric geodesics between a pair of points in Teichm\"uller space, we find that by imposing an additional energy minimization constraint on the geodesics, thought of as limits of harmonic map rays, we select a unique Thurston geodesic through those points. Extending the target surface to the Thurston boundary yields, for each point $Y$ in Teichm\"uller space, an \enquote{exponential map} of rays from that point $Y$ onto Teichm\"uller space with visual boundary the Thurston boundary of Teichm\"uller space.
  We first depict harmonic map ray structures on Teichm\"uller space as a geometric transition between Teichm\"uller ray structures and Thurston geodesic ray structures. In particular, by appropriately degenerating the source of a harmonic map between hyperbolic surfaces (along \enquote{harmonic map dual rays}), the harmonic map rays through the target converge to a Thurston geodesic; by appropriately degenerating the target of the harmonic map, those harmonic map dual rays through the domain converge to Teichm\"uller geodesics. We then extend this transition to one from Teichm\"uller disks through Hopf differential disks to stretch-earthquake disks. These results apply to surfaces with boundary, resolving a question on stretch maps between such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Proof of geometric Borg's Theorem in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta+V$ be the discrete Schr\"odinger operator, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and potential $V:\mathbb{Z}^d\to \mathbb{C}$ is $\Gamma$-periodic with $\Gamma=q_1\mathbb{Z}\oplus q_2 \mathbb{Z}\oplus\cdots\oplus q_d\mathbb{Z}$. In this study, we establish a comprehensive characterization of complex-valued $\Gamma$-periodic functions such that the Bloch variety of $\Delta+V$ contains a graph of an entire function, in particular, we show that there are exactly $q_1q_2\cdots q_d$ such functions (up to Floquet isospectrality and translation). Moreover, by applying this understanding to real-valued functions $V$, we prove that $V$ is constant if and only if the Bloch variety of $\Delta+V$ contains a graph of an entire function, which confirms the conjecture concerning the geometric version of Borg's theorem in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Envelopes of the Thurston metric on Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the Thurston (asymmetric) metric on Teichm\"uller space, the defect from being uniquely geodesic is described by the envelope, defined as the union of geodesics from the initial point to the terminal point.
  Using the harmonic stretch lines we defined recently, we describe the shape of envelopes as a cone over a cone over a space, defined from a topological invariant of the initial and terminal points. In addition, we show that the envelope is always contractible. We prove that envelopes vary continuously with their endpoints. We also provide a parametrization of out-envelopes and in-envelopes in terms of straightened measured laminations complementary to the prescribed maximally stretched laminations.
  We extend most of these results to the metrically infinite envelopes which have a terminal point on the Thurston boundary, illustrating some of the nuances of these with examples, and describing the accumulation set. Finally, we develop a new characterization of harmonic stretch lines that avoids a limiting process.</description>
