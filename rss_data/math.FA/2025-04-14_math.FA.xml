      <title>Hyers-Ulam Stability of Quadratic Operators in Locally Convex Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability problem in Ulam's sense has recently been explored in locally convex cone environments, as shown in \cite{ MNF, NR1, NR2}. In continuation of this research direction, our work examines the stability properties of the quadratic functional equation \[ 2f\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right) + 2f\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right) = f(x) + f(y) \] in such structures. We present novel stability theorems that offer enhanced comprehension of operator behavior when subjected to perturbations. These results advance the theoretical framework of Hyers-Ulam stability within locally convex cones while elucidating distinctive characteristics of quadratic operators in this context. Our investigation both strengthens the mathematical underpinnings of stability theory and provides new perspectives on interactions between certain operators and locally convex spaces.</description>

      <title>Construction of Spaces with an Indefinite two-Metric and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the notion of a two-Krein space and show that, starting from any classical Krein space, it is possible to construct spaces endowed with an indefinite two-inner product (admitting both positive and negative values). We develop the theory of two-Krein spaces, extending the classical structure and providing new tools for analysis in spaces with an indefinite two-inner product. It is established that the fundamental decomposition of a Krein space transfers orthogonality to the space with an indefinite two-metric. Moreover, the properties of the fundamental symmetry of the classical Krein space are carried over to the standardized two-Krein space.
  It is shown that the sets of positive and negative vectors generate a space with a semi-definite positive and complete two-inner product. One of the most important results in the theory of spaces with an indefinite metric is the equivalence of norms; in this work, we extend this result to standardized spaces with an indefinite two-metric. Additionally, the notion of function strongly of bounded variation in two-Krein spaces is introduced and some of their properties are established. It is also shown that the classical definition of bounded variation in two-Hilbert spaces is a particular case of the one presented in this work. Furthermore, we present a technique to construct functions of bounded t-variation in standardized two-Krein spaces from functions of bounded variation in Krein spaces, and we guarantee that when the t-variation of a function is zero, the two-norm evaluated at the images of the function remains constant with respect to t. Finally, we show that the class of strongly bounded t-variation functions in a standardized two-Krein space can be endowed with the structure of a two-norm.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amenability of group actions on topological spaces generalizes amenability of groups and has applications in group theory, such as characterizing $C^{*}$--exact groups. We characterized it in terms of Banach algebras. For a topological group $G$ , group amenability can be characterized through the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if all derivations from $A$ to any dual--type $A$--$A$--Banach bimodules are inner. We extended this result to discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces, using a certain Banach algebra arising from the action and a weakened amenability condition of Banach algebras. We also proved a fixed point characterization of amenable actions, which improves the result by Dong and Wang (2015).</description>

      <title>Set-Valued Fractal Approximation for Countable Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal geometry deals mainly with irregularity and captures the complexity of a structure or phenomenon. In this article, we focus on the approximation of set-valued functions using modern machinery on the subject of fractal geometry. We first provide a construction of fractal functions for countable data sets and use these functions in the approximation and study of set-valued mappings. We also show the existence and uniqueness of an invariant Borel measure supported on the graph of a set-valued fractal function. In addition, we obtain some effective bounds on the dimensions of the constructed set-valued fractal functions.</description>

      <title>Periodic homogenization of convolution type operators with heavy tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with periodic homogenization of nonlocal symmetric convolution type operators in $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$,
  whose kernel is the product of a density that belongs to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law
  and a rapidly oscillating positive periodic function.
  Assuming that the local oscillation of the said density satisfies a proper upper bound at infinity, we prove homogenization result for the studied family of operators.</description>

      <title>Matrix concentration inequalities for dependent binary random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Bernstein-type matrix concentration inequalities for linear combinations with matrix coefficients of binary random variables satisfying certain $\ell_\infty$-independence assumptions, complementing recent results by Kaufman, Kyng and Solda. For random variables with the Stochastic Covering Property or Strong Rayleigh Property we prove estimates for general functions satisfying certain direction aware matrix bounded difference inequalities, generalizing and strengthening earlier estimates by the first-named author and Polaczyk.
  We also demonstrate a general decoupling inequality for a class of Banach-space valued quadratic forms in negatively associated random variables and combine it with the matrix Bernstein inequality to generalize results by Tropp, Chr\'etien and Darses, and Ruetz and Schnass, concerning the operator norm of a random submatrix of a deterministic matrix, drawn by uniform sampling without replacements or rejective sampling, to submatrices given by general Strong Rayleigh sampling schemes.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities: a review on stability and instability results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review recent results on stability and instability in logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, with a particular emphasis on strong norms. We consider several versions of these inequalities on the Euclidean space, for the Lebesgue and the Gaussian measures, and discuss their differences in terms of moments and stability. We give new and direct proofs, as well as examples. Although we do not cover all aspects of the topic, we hope to contribute to establishing the state of the art.</description>

      <title>The super Alternative Daugavet property for Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the super alternative Daugavet property (super ADP) which lies strictly between the Daugavet property and the Alternative Daugavet property as follows. A Banach space $X$ has the super ADP if for every element $x$ in the unit sphere and for every relatively weakly open subset $W$ of the unit ball intersecting the unit sphere, one can find an element $y\in W$ and a modulus one scalar $\theta$ such that $\|x+\theta y\|$ is almost two. It is known that spaces with the Daugavet property satisfy this condition, and that this condition implies the Alternative Daugavet property. We first provide examples of super ADP spaces which fail the Daugavet property. We show that the norm of a super ADP space is rough, hence the space cannot be Asplund, and we also prove that the space fails the point of continuity property (particularly, the Radon--Nikod\'ym property). In particular, we get examples of spaces with the Alternative Daugavet property that fail the super ADP. For a better understanding of the differences between the super ADP, the Daugavet property, and the Alternative Daugavet property, we will also consider the localizations of these three properties and prove that they behave rather differently. As a consequence, we provide characterizations of the super ADP for spaces of vector-valued continuous functions and of vector-valued integrable functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that (central) Cowling-Haagerup constant of discrete quantum groups is multiplicative, which extends the result of Freslon to general (not necesarilly unimodular) discrete quantum groups. The crucial feature of our approach is considering algebras $\mathrm{C}(\mathbb{G}), \operatorname{L}^{\infty}(\mathbb{G})$ as operator modules over $\operatorname{L}^1(\mathbb{G})$.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Moreau Envelopes of f-Divergences in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commonly used $f$-divergences of measures, e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence, are subject to limitations regarding the support of the involved measures. A remedy is regularizing the $f$-divergence by a squared maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) associated with a characteristic kernel $K$. We use the kernel mean embedding to show that this regularization can be rewritten as the Moreau envelope of some function on the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Then, we exploit well-known results on Moreau envelopes in Hilbert spaces to analyze the MMD-regularized $f$-divergences, particularly their gradients. Subsequently, we use our findings to analyze Wasserstein gradient flows of MMD-regularized $f$-divergences. We provide proof-of-the-concept numerical examples for flows starting from empirical measures. Here, we cover $f$-divergences with infinite and finite recession constants. Lastly, we extend our results to the tight variational formulation of $f$-divergences and numerically compare the resulting flows.</description>
