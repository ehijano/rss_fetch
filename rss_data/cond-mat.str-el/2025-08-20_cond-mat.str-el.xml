      <title>Engineering Hubbard models with gated two-dimensional moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moir\'e systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moir\'e potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moir\'e potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moir\'e potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moir\'e systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</description>

      <title>Charge Ordering and Magnetic Exchange in the Ladder-Type Compound NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-temperature electronic and magnetic properties of NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$, an isoelectronic analog of the spin-ladder compound $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$, are investigated using DFT+$U$ calculations. Two charge-ordering patterns - zigzag and linear chains of V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ ions - are considered. The zigzag configuration is found to be energetically preferred and exhibits insulating behavior with a band gap of 1.7 eV. In this state, magnetic V$^{4+}$ (d$^1$) ions form antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Calculated exchange interactions reveal strong diagonal (intrarung) and interladder couplings, indicating a complex spin-ladder network. These results suggest that NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$ retains essential spin-ladder characteristics while displaying new structural and magnetic features arising from the larger size and non-spherical geometry of the NH$_4^+$ ion compared to Na$^+$.</description>

      <title>Unified description of spin-lattice coupling: application to thermodynamic properties of the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended model to describe the spin-lattice coupling, incorporating individual vibrations of bonds and atomic sites alongside distance-dependent exchange interactions. The proposed spin Hamiltonian can be effectively considered as an interpolation between two well-established minimum models, the bond-phonon model and the site-phonon model. The extended model well reproduces successive field-induced phase transitions as well as the thermodynamic properties of a 3-up-1-down state in the pyrochlore-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, including negative thermal expansion, an enhanced magnetocaloric effect, and a sharp specific-heat peak. Our approach is broadly applicable to various spin models, providing a framework for identifying the primary phonon modes responsible for spin-lattice coupling and for understanding complex magnetic phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in a Cubic Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a theory for the energy dispersion of chiral phonons in a simplest cubic lattice. Among all the phonon modes, only the optical triplet modes exhibit the intrinsic characteristics of chiral phonons near k=0, and we examine their energy splitting in detail by analyzing the dynamical matrix. To first order in k, the splitting is described by a spin-1 Weyl Hamiltonian, and helicity becomes a good quantum number. It asymptotically coincides with the crystal angular momentum for k parallel &lt;111&gt; up to a global sign. The Hamiltonian incorporates a pseudoscalar coupling constant associated with electric toroidal monopoles, determined by the spatial configuration of the stiffness tensors.</description>

      <title>Unravelling disorder in kagome Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of phonon instabilities that leads to the formation of charge modulated states in kagome metals has allowed their classification based on the atomic displacements. Here, we use diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering, backed by Monte Carlo simulations to describe a type-I instability in the kagome metal Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$. We find that the in-plane distortion of Co in the kagome plane drives a structural transition with the appearance of new Bragg peaks at odd $L$, which are surrounded by a hexagonal diffuse signal. The anisotropic diffuse scattering, characteristic of a highly frustrated triangular lattice was simulated following a combination of Ising hamiltonian and Lennard-Jones potential, and demonstrate that the structural phase transition in Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$ is of an order-disorder transformation type. The inelastic spectra reveals no softening but an anomalous broadening of the $\Gamma-A$ low energy acoustic mode. Our results highlight the critical role of the geometric frustration in promoting ordering from disorder in kagome lattices and power of diffuse scattering to disentangle the internal atomic displacements and correlated disorder.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Frustration Modulation in $\kappa$-type Quantum Spin Liquid Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key parameter controlling electronic and magnetic properties of quantum spin liquid systems, yet remains challenging to tune. Here, we coherently drive molecular vibrations with midinfrared pulses in two organic quantum spin liquid candidates, the insulating $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ and the metallic $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$, and probe their electronic response through ultrafast reflectivity measurements. We observe a nonlinear coupling between local molecular vibrations and nonlocal phonons, which is expected to directly modulate the geometric frustration of their triangular lattice. Our findings establish a promising route to dynamically control frustration in nonbipartite quantum materials.</description>

      <title>When Does a Single Repulsive Dirac Cone Superconduct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in a single two-dimensional Dirac cone offers a natural route to topological superconductivity. While usually considered extrinsic -- arising from proximity to a conventional superconductor -- we investigate when a doped Dirac cone can spontaneously develop superconductivity from a short-range repulsive interaction $U$ via the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism. We show that an ideal, linear Dirac cone is immune to pairing at leading order in $U^2$. Superconductivity instead emerges only through higher-order in $k$ corrections to the dispersion, which are unavoidable in any lattice realization and crucially dictate the pairing symmetry. The form of the pairing thus reflects how the well-known obstruction to realizing a single Dirac cone on a lattice is circumvented. When a Dirac cone arises from broken time-reversal symmetry -- for instance, at a transition between Chern insulators or in a valley-polarized phase -- we find a topological $p - ip$ state whose chirality is opposite to that of the parent chiral metal above $T_c$. By contrast, for a surface Dirac cone of a 3D topological insulator, superconductivity is stabilized by anisotropies in the dispersion. For $C_{3v}$-symmetric warping, as in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}$, pairing is strongest when the Fermi surface becomes hexagonal, leading to order in the $(d \pm id)\times(p+ip)$ channel with accidental near-nodes. In the highly anisotropic limit $v_x \gg v_y$, relevant to side surfaces of layered materials, the Fermi surface splits into two branches, and nesting favors a pairing symmetry $\Delta \sim \mathrm{sgn}(k_x)\cos(k_y)$ reminiscent of organic superconductors.</description>

      <title>Real-time bubble nucleation and growth for false vacuum decay on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model, focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory of false vacuum decay in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we theoretically investigate the false vacuum decay process in a ferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 chain. We develop a many-body theory describing the nucleation and the coherent dynamics of true-vacuum bubbles that is analytically tractable and agrees with numerical matrix product state calculations in all parameter regimes up to intermediate times. This bosonic theory allows us to identify different regimes in the parameter space and unravel the underlying physical mechanisms. In particular, regimes that closely correspond to the cosmological false vacuum decay picture are highlighted and characterized in terms of observable quantities.</description>

      <title>Programmable Anyon Mobility through Higher Order Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling anyon mobility is critical for robust quantum memory and understanding symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases with subsystem symmetries (e.g., line-like, fractal, chaotic, or mixed supports). However, a unified framework for anyon mobility in SET phases with such diverse geometric patterns of symmetry supports has remained a major challenge. In this Letter, by introducing higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) -- a powerful computer science tool -- to SET physics, we establish a unified approach for complete characterization of anyon mobility induced by the complexity of subsystem symmetries. First, we design finite-depth HOCA-controlled unitary quantum circuits, yielding exactly solvable SET models with Abelian anyons and all possible locally generated subsystem symmetries. Then, we present a theorem that precisely programs all excitation mobilities (fractons, lineons, or fully mobile anyons) directly from the HOCA rule, representing the first complete characterization of anyon mobility in SET phases. As a corollary, this theorem yields symmetry-enriched fusion rules which govern mobility transmutation during fusion. Fusion rules with multiple channels are identified, exhibiting non-Abelian characteristics in Abelian anyon systems. Leveraging HOCA, this Letter opens new avenues for characterization of SET phases of matter and programmability of topological quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$ plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Exchange interactions in itinerant magnets: the effects of local particle-hole irreducible vertex corrections and SU(2) symmetry of Hund interaction</title>

Abstract: We study exchange interactions in iron and nickel within the DFT+DMFT approach with density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction. In particular, we analyze the representation of exchange interactions through the electron non-local Green's functions, connecting the local particle-hole (ph) irreducible interaction vertices. While the neglect of the local ph-irreducible vertex corrections, suggested previously within the dual fermion approach [E. A. Stepanov, et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 121}, 037204 (2018)], yields the result corresponding to the generalization of the magnetic force theorem approach, we argue that these vertex corrections are in fact less important for strong localized magnets, such as iron, but become more essential for weak itinerant magnets, such as nickel. At the same time, the overall account of the local vertex and self-energy corrections in the so-called renormalized magnetic force theorem approach is essential for iron, and less important for nickel. The difference of the results of density-density and SU(2) symmetric Coulomb interaction is found to be relatively small, in contrast to the Curie temperature and the value of the local magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Role of On-site and Inter-site Coulomb Interactions in KV$_3$Sb$_5$: A first-principles DFT+$U$+$V$ study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal Coulomb interactions. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$.

      <title>Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19580</link>

Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11560v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has generated significant interest in uncovering the underlying pairing mechanisms and correlated electronic states. While earlier theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of nonlocal Coulomb interactions, in the presence of onsite interactions, on both superconducting and density-wave instabilities using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. We find that the interlayer intraorbital repulsion suppresses the interlayer intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave (SDW) order, while promoting a transition to an interlayer interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state and a mirror-symmetry-breaking charge order. Remarkably, the critical scale of the interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, indicating that the former is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Moreover, the interlayer interorbital repulsion suppresses this $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing but enhances the $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing through strengthened interlayer charge fluctuations. In addition, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion favors an in-plane charge-density-wave (CDW) order with wave vector $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings reveal the profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and underscore the robustness of interlayer pairing rooted in the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, thereby advancing the understanding of the intricate correlation effects in bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Universal relations between thermoelectrics and noise in mesoscopic transport across a tunnel junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for currents and noise in transport experiments. Our findings uncover a set of universal transport relations between thermoelectric and noise properties of a system probed through a tunnel contact, with the Wiedemann-Franz law being just one example of such universality between charge and heat currents. We apply this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo, quantum Hall and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dots, and demonstrate that each of the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.</description>

      <title>Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</description>

      <title>Structural contribution to light-induced gap suppression in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.</description>
