      <title>Searching for additional structure and redshift evolution in the observed binary black hole population with a parametric time-dependent mass distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of the observed gravitational wave events encodes unique information on the formation and evolution of stellar-mass black holes, from the underlying astrophysical processes to the large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We use the ICAROGW analysis infrastructure to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on the gravitational wave signals from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run, O3. Searching for additional structure and redshift evolution in the primary mass distribution, we explore the dependence of the mass spectrum reconstruction on different parametrizations and prior choices. For the stationary case, we find strong evidence (Bayes factor $B \simeq 180$) that the results obtained using a power-law model with a peak (Powerlaw-Gaussian)--the model preferred so far in the literature--are sensitive to prior bounds, affecting the resolvability of the $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$ peak. This behaviour is reproduced by simulated data, indicating a bimodal structure in the likelihood. Models with three mass features simultaneously capture a sharp $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ peak, a $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$ overdensity, and support for a $\sim 20 M_{\odot}$ overdensity preceded by a dip. Among these, a model with three power-law peaks (Powerlaw-Powerlaw-Powerlaw) is equally favored, in terms of evidence, over the Powerlaw-Gaussian model with wide priors. We find no statistical support for redshift evolution in the current data and provide constraints on the parameters governing this evolution, showing consistency with stationarity. We highlight possible limitations of the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework in reconstructing evolving features outside the detector horizon. Our work lays the foundations for a robust characterization of time-dependent population distributions, with significant implications for black hole astrophysics and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>When resonances kick in: the cumulative effect of orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) have been proven to be a key feature for accurate gravitational-wave template modeling. Decades of research have led to schemes that can not only model the adiabatic inspiral of such a binary system, but also account for the effects of resonances on their evolution. In this work, we use an effective resonance model that includes analytically derived corrections to the radiation reaction fluxes, to study the combined effects of both dominant and sub-dominant resonances on EMRIs. We show that using single, universal shifts for all fluxes overestimates the resonance impact, and therefore individualized shifts for each resonance crossing are needed for accurate modeling. Our analysis reveals that the cumulative effects from multiple resonance crossings can significantly impact the orbital evolution of the EMRIs, especially for highly eccentric orbits. Our results provide further evidence that resonance effects have to be included in template production to extract detailed astrophysical parameters from EMRI signals.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal approach for linear and non-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this numerical work, we deal with two distinct problems concerning the propagation of waves in cosmological backgrounds. In both cases, we employ a spacetime foliation given in terms of compactified hyperboloidal slices. These slices intersect future null infinity, so our method is well-suited to study the long-time behaviour of waves. Moreover, our construction is adapted to the presence of the time--dependent scale factor that describes the underlying spacetime expansion. First, we investigate decay rates for solutions to the linear wave equation in a large class of expanding FLRW spacetimes, whose non--compact spatial sections have either zero or negative curvature. By means of a hyperboloidal foliation, we provide new numerical evidence for the sharpness of decay--in--time estimates for linear waves propagating in such spacetimes. Then, in the spatially-flat case, we present numerical results in support of small data global existence of solutions to semi-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes having a decelerated expansion, provided that a generalized null condition holds. In absence of this null condition and in the specific case of $ \square_g \phi = (\partial_t \phi)^2 $ (Fritz John's choice), the results we obtain suggest that, when the spacetime expansion is sufficiently slow, solutions diverge in finite time for every choice of initial data.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Gravity in Gravitational Wave Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms on the gravitational wave memory effect. In certain quantum gravity theories and semi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects) exhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger waveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the detector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features following the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect signatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black holes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform templates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In this work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory arising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar ${\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features is model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real interferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is estimated subsequently. We further compute the physical fluxes associated to the echo at both the black hole horizon and null infinity and identify novel distinguishing features of the underlying reflectivity models in measurement data.</description>

      <title>On the viability of higher order theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In physics, all dynamical equations that describe fundamental interactions are second order ordinary differential equations in the time derivatives. In the literature, this property is traced back to a result obtained by Ostrogradski in the mid 19th century, which is the technical basis of a 'no-go' theorem for higher order theories. In this work, we review the connection of symmetry properties with the order of dynamical equations, before reconsidering Ostrogradski's result. Then, we show how Ostrogradski's conclusion is reached by applying to higher order theories concepts and method that have been specifically developed for second order theories. We discuss a potential lack of consistency in this approach, to support the claim that Ostrogradski's result applies to a class of higher order theories that is nowhere representative of generic ones: we support this claim by giving an example of a higher-order Lagrangian that is asymptotically stable, but that would be unstable under Ostrogradski's criterion. We also conclude that, when considering higher order theories as fundamental, we may need to reconsider and extend the conceptual framework on which our standard treatment of second order theories is based.</description>

      <title>A MOND model applied to the rotation curve of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modified Newton dynamics (MOND) model to study the rotation curves of galaxies. The model is described by an arctangent interpolating function and it fits the rotation curves of several galaxies without invoking the presence of dark matter. We took from the literature the rotation curve data of fifteen spiral galaxies, and used it to constrain the model parameter, $a_0$, as around $5\times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. This parameter is also called the acceleration constant once it gives the acceleration scale where Newton's dynamics fails. The model can be further tested in different astrophysical scenarios, such as, the missing mass problem of galaxy clusters and the accelerated expansion of the Universe, thus leading to a more robust and well constrained model.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After studying properties of the Nariai solution, including its geodesics, in spherical and de Sitter coordinates, two kinds of accelerated motion are investigated in detail: either observers at rest with respect to the coordinates, or observers in radial motion. Next, massless scalar perturbations of Nariai spacetime in absence of sources are worked out, and an explicit example out of the black hole context of analytic self-force calculation is obtained. Last, self-force effects are studied as well, together with some variant of the type of Poynting-Robertson external force, and also building a test electromagnetic field and a test gravitational field in Nariai spacetime geometry</description>

      <title>Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string cusps with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array third data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). Since GWs are anticipated from cosmic strings, PTAs offer a viable approach to testing their existence. We present the results of the first Bayesian search for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string cusps (GWCS) using the third PPTA data release for 30 millisecond pulsars. In this data collection, we find no evidence for GWCS signals. We compare a model with a GWCS signal to one with only noise, including a common spatially uncorrelated red noise (CURN), and find that our data is more consistent with the noise-only model.We then establish upper limits on the strain amplitude of GWCS at the pulsar term, based on the analysis of 30 millisecond pulsars, after finding no compelling evidence. We find the addition of a CURN with different spectral indices into the noise model has a negligible impact on the upper limits. And the upper limit range of the amplitude of the pulsar-term GWCS is concentrated between 10^{-12} and 10^{-11}. Finally, we set upper limits on the amplitude of GWCS events, parametrized by width and event epoch, for a single pulsar PSR J1857+0943. Moreover, we derive upper limit on the cosmic string tension as a function of burst width and compare it with previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize basic features of quantum gravity states and processes, common to a number of related quantum gravity formalisms, and sharing a purely combinatorial and algebraic language, and a discrete geometric interpretation. We emphasize how, in this context, entanglement is a seed of topological and geometric properties, and how a pre-geometric, discrete notion of quantum causality can be implemented, as well as some recent results (based on random tensor network techniques) on the conditions for information transmission and holographic behaviour in quantum gravity states. Together, these features indicate that quantum information concepts and tools play a key role in defining the fundamental structure of quantum spacetime.</description>

      <title>Einstein's Equivalence Principle in Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a precise quantum formulation of Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) is developed within the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. By employing detailed analyses in both the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures, it is demonstrated that an observer in free fall in a uniform gravitational field is equivalent to an inertial observer in the absence of such a field. The transformations of the wave function are reexamined, and the conditions for the equality of inertial and gravitational mass are established -- thereby consistently deriving the gravitational redshift observed in neutron interferometry experiments. Additionally, relevant applications of the proposed formalism are explored in confined systems (such as particles in potential boxes and in linear potential barriers), elucidating quantum tunneling phenomena and their dependence on energy levels. The results reaffirm the validity of the Equivalence Principle in the nonrelativistic quantum regime and open new perspectives for integrating quantum mechanics and general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a novel realization of dark bubble cosmology in non-supersymmetric string theory. Among the simplest models in ten dimensions, the type 0'B orientifold is the unique option which yields a scale-separated construction. The resulting setting produces a logarithmically varying dynamical dark energy, reflecting its holographic counterpart in terms of running gauge couplings. We analyze in detail the phenomenological consequences of the model for particle physics, inflation and late-time cosmology. We find that, although particle physics may be consistently realized, neither early-time nor late-time are observationally viable.</description>

      <title>Void and Density Walls Inhomogeneous Cosmic Web Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An approach to cosmological modelling is presented that incorporates the inhomogeneous structure of the Cosmic Web, specifically focusing on the interplay between cosmic voids and density walls. We extend the standard homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model to account for the observed large-scale structure of the universe. By modifying the Friedmann equations to include inhomogeneity terms representing voids and walls, we develop a more realistic description of cosmic evolution. Our model demonstrates how the presence of these structures affects the overall expansion rate of the universe and the growth of perturbations. We find that accounting for this inhomogeneous distribution leads to significant deviations from the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the late-time universe. The Hubble and $\sigma_8$ structure growth tensions are addressed in the void-density wall model, leading to a resolution of these tensions. These results have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations when including the void and density wall Cosmic Web inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>Limits to the validity of quantum-optical models of the effects of gravitational redshift on photonic quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the domain of validity of a quantum optical model describing the effects of gravitational redshift on the quantum state of photons that propagate in curved spacetime. We find that the model is consistent for small redshift, but fails for larger redshifts. Surprisingly, the range of the redshift for which the model applies is conditional not only to the gravitational parameters, but also to those that define the photonic modes. We provide an analysis to characterize this aspect and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss implications for theoretical science as well as for the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of quantum void where the flow of time is deduced directly from quantum fluctuations and the consequent particle-antiparticle creations. Given a certain number of space-like separated pair creation events, assumed to happen all at the same initial time, we show that past and future can be foliated into a sequence of adapted manifolds based on how many events causally influence them. We also give an explicit construction for the simplest case of one space dimension.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Neural Networks approach to fuzzball geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Anisotropic Universe Through Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: A Case Study of The Bianchi Type-I Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe are the cardinal principles of modern cosmology built on the definition of metric through the prescription by Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW). From the aspects of geometry, the presence of anisotropy, inhomogeneity, or both are allowed in the metrics defined as the Bianchi type I and V metrics. In this letter, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism, and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on the global anisotropy offered in the Bianchi type I metrics, providing a new path to explore in the background of global anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum arrival times in free fall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a time measurement $T_x$ at position $x$ can be inferred from the probability distribution of a position measurement $X_t$ at time $t$ as given by the Born rule [Time-of-arrival distributions for continuous quantum systems and application to quantum backflow, Phys. Rev. A 110, 052217 (2024)]. In an application to free-fall, this finding has been used to predict the existence of a mass-dependent positive relative shift with respect to the classical time-of-arrival in the long time-of-flight regime for dropped quantum particles [M. Beau and L. Martellini, Quantum delay in the time of arrival of free-falling atoms, Phys. Rev. A 109, 012216 (2024).]. The present paper extends these results in two important directions. We first show that for a Gaussian quantum particle of mass $m$ dropped in a uniform gravitational field $g$, the uncertainties about time and position measurements are related by the relation $ \Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg} . $ This novel form of uncertainty relation suggests that choosing the initial state so as to obtain a lower uncertainty in the measured position leads to a higher uncertainty in the measured arrival time. Secondly, we examine the case of a free-falling particle starting from a non-Gaussian initial superposed state, for which we predict the presence of gravitationally induced interferences and oscillations in the mean time-of-arrival as a function of the detector's position that can be interpreted as the signature of a Zitterbewegung-like effect.</description>

Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Black hole merger simulations in wave dark matter environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of binary black hole mergers with their environments can be studied using numerical relativity simulations. These start only a short finite time before merger, at which point appropriate initial conditions must be imposed. A key task is therefore to identify the configuration that is appropriate for the binary and its environment at this stage of the evolution. In this work we study the behaviour of wave dark matter around equal mass black hole binaries, finding that there is a preferred, quasi-stationary profile that persists and grows over multiple orbits, in contrast to heavier mass dark matter where any overdensity tends to be dispersed by the binary motion. Whilst different initial configurations converge to the preferred quasi-stationary one after several orbits, unwanted transient oscillations are generated in the process, which may impact on the signal in short simulation runs. We also point out that naively superimposing the matter onto a circular binary results in artificially eccentric orbits due to the matter backreaction, which is an effect of the initial conditions and not a signature of dark matter. We discuss the further work required so that comparison of waveforms obtained with environments to vacuum cases can be done in a meaningful way.</description>

      <title>Revisiting van Citter-Zernike correlations in the presence of primordial gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a quantum field theory framework to describe the interaction between a gravitational wave (GW) background and an electromagnetic (EM) field emitted from a distant celestial source, such as a star. We demonstrate that a background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), as predicted by the inflationary scenario, induces a loss of spatial coherence in the EM field as it propagates over cosmological distances. This effect leads to the degradation of van Cittert-Zernike correlations, ultimately rendering them unobservable - a phenomenon referred to as blurring. Since spatial coherence is observed in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) measurements of distant quasars, this places constraints on the amplitude of the PGW background. We quantitatively evaluate the blurring effect caused by PGWs in a two-mode squeezed state, which represents the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest inflationary models. However, due to the weak coupling between GWs and the EM field, we find that the induced incoherence is too small to be detected in current VLBI observations.</description>

      <title>Identifying thermal effects in neutron star merger remnants with model-agnostic waveform reconstructions and third-generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the intrinsic differences in simulated gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, arising from varying approaches to incorporating thermal effects in numerical-relativity modeling. We consider a hybrid approach in which the equation of state (EOS) comprises a cold, zero-temperature, piecewise-polytropic part and a thermal part described by an ideal gas, and a {\it tabulated} approach based on self-consistent, microphysical, finite-temperature EOS. We use time-domain waveforms corresponding to BNS merger simulations with four different EOSs. Those are injected into Gaussian noise given by the sensitivity of the third-generation detector Einstein Telescope and reconstructed using BayesWave, a Bayesian data-analysis algorithm that recovers the signals through a model-agnostic approach. The two representations of thermal effects result in different dominant peak frequencies in the spectra of the postmerger signals, for both the quadrupole fundamental mode and the late-time inertial modes. For some of the EOSs investigated those differences are large enough to be told apart, especially in the early postmerger phase when the signal amplitude is the loudest. Our results suggest that a self-consistent treatment of thermal effects in BNS postmerger modeling is essential to prevent significant parameter biases in upcoming gravitational-wave detections.</description>

Abstract: A new exact magnetized solution describing a Kiselev black hole immersed in a magnetic field is used for studying the dynamics of charged particles. Different types of trajectories are discussed. In the particular case of a weak magnetic field, we employ a first-order perturbative approach to analyze the perturbed circular orbits near the minimum of the effective potential. We obtain an approximate solution for the bounded equatorial trajectory subjected to small radial and latitudinal oscillations. The shape of the trajectory localized near the stable circular orbit depends on the relation between the attractive gravitational force and the repulsive quintessence contribution.</description>

      <title>On a reconstruction procedure for special spherically symmetric metrics in the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model: the Schwarzschild metric test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 4D gravitational model with a real scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms is considered. The action contains the potential $U(\varphi)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$. For a special static spherically symmetric metric $ds^2 = (A(u))^{-1} du^2 - A(u) dt^2 + u^2 d\Omega^2$, with $A(u) &gt; 0$ ($u &gt; 0$ is a radial coordinate), we verify the so-called reconstruction procedure suggested by Nojiri and Nashed. This procedure presents certain implicit relations for $U(\varphi)$ and $f(\varphi)$ which lead to exact solutions to the equations of motion for a given metric governed by $A(u)$. We confirm that all relations in the approach of Nojiri and Nashed for $f(\varphi(u))$ and $\varphi(u)$ are correct, but the relation for $U(\varphi(u))$ contains a typo which is eliminated in this paper. Here we apply the procedure to the (external) Schwarzschild metric with the gravitational radius $2 \mu $ and $u &gt; 2 \mu$. Using the ``no-ghost'' restriction (i.e., reality of $\varphi(u)$), we find two families of $(U(\varphi), f(\varphi))$. The first one gives us the Schwarzschild metric defined for $u &gt; 3 \mu$, while the second one describes the Schwarzschild metric defined for $2 \mu &lt; u &lt; 3 \mu$ ($3 \mu$ is the radius of the photon sphere). In both cases the potential $U(\varphi)$ is negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogue Hawking radiation from acoustic horizons is now a well-established phenomenon, both theoretically and experimentally. Its persistence, despite the modified dispersion relations characterising analogue models, has been crucial in advancing our understanding of the robustness of this phenomenon against ultraviolet modifications of our spacetime description. However, previous theoretical approaches, such as the Bogoliubov transformation relating asymptotic states, have somewhat lacked a straightforward physical intuition regarding the origin of this robustness and its limits of applicability. To address this, we revisit analogue Hawking radiation using the tunneling method. We present a unified treatment that allows us to consider flows with and without acoustic horizons and with superluminal or subluminal dispersion relations. This approach clarifies the fundamental mechanism behind the resilience of Hawking radiation in these settings and explains the puzzling occurrence of excitations even in subcritical (supercritical) flows with subluminal (superluminal) dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild black-hole immersed in an electric or magnetic background in Entangled Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the solution for a Schwarzschild black-hole immersed in an electric or magnetic background field \`a la Melvin within the framework of Entangled Relativity. Previous solutions in Entangled Relativity required black-holes to be charged for the matter field to be defined everywhere. This is because the theory precludes the existence of vacuum solutions, thereby satisfying Einstein's definition of Mach's Principle. The current black-hole solutions represent the first exact and neutral black-hole solutions of Entangled Relativity discovered to date. The Schwarzschild black-hole of General Relativity emerges as a limit of these solutions when the background field approaches zero, whereas the Melvin solution of General Relativity does not emerge as a limit when the black hole's size approaches zero. This finding suggests that astrophysical black-holes in Entangled Relativity are indistinguishable from those in General Relativity, given the generally weak interstellar density of matter fields.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight bosons. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we focus on the superradiance of a scalar boson, and perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modeled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

Abstract: The efforts to probe the horizon-scale structure of black holes, such as Event Horizon Telescope and GRAVITY interferometer, might provide valuable insights into the strong-field regime of Einstein's theory of gravity. In the near field region of a black hole, the observational signatures of moving hotspots might potentially reveal the mechanism causing the flares, or reflect the spacetime geometries. This paper develops a ray tracing scenario to study higher-order images of moving hotspots in a thin disk around a spherical black hole. Our ray-tracing scenario establishes a one-to-one mapping between emission locations and observer's sky. It enables us to perform infinite-precision simulations for the images, because the emission sources are projected directly onto the image plane. Furthermore, we show that a source located anywhere outside the black hole can be repeatedly mapped onto the observer's sky, from primary to higher-order images. We investigate the observational signatures of hotspots, focusing on temporal fluxes and flux centroids from the primary to sixth-order images. The hotspots are considered to be moving in circular, escape, and plunging orbits. Our results find that the higher-order images can be categorized into two types. Within each type, the temporal fluxes exhibit a self-similar profile. Furthermore, as the hotspots approach the event horizon of a black hole, the fluxes from higher-order images alternately dominate the observed flux, which subsequently result in the flux decaying with time in an oscillatory manner.</description>

      <title>Quintessence phase of the late-time Universe in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the late-time accelerating expansion of the Universe using the matter-geometry coupled $ f(Q, T) $ gravity model, where $ Q $ is the non-metricity scalar and $ T $ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We constrain the best-fit values of cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \alpha_0~\mbox{and}~ \beta_0$ through the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation {using 31 Hubble parameter data points from cosmic chronometers (CC) and 26 data points from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), making a total of 57 datasets (labeled \texttt{CC+BAO}), as well as SNIa distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon+ sample, which consists of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct supernovae (labeled \texttt{Pantheon +SHOES}), and their combination (labeled \texttt{CC+BAO+Pantheon +SHOES)}}. {We compare our constrained Hubble constant $H_0$ value with different late-time and early-time cosmological measurements.} Deceleration {parameter} \(q(z)\), effective equation of state parameters \(w_{eff}(z)\), Hubble parameter $H(z)$, and distance modulus \(\mu(z)\) are numerical results of dynamical quantities that show that the $f(Q, T)$ gravity model is compatible with a transition towards a quintessence-like phase in the late-time. In conformity with \(\Lambda\)CDM, we moreover take into account the geometrical interpretations by considering the state-finder parameters \(r-s\) and \(r-q\), which are crucial parameters for additional analysis. Additionally, the statistical analysis has been carried out for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent the Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant, which forbids the existence of any solution to the cosmological constant problem within the context of local field theories unless some fine-tuning is assumed. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmological constant as a nonlocal gravitational effect on very large scales. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analogue gravity setups.</description>

      <title>Properties of Ultralight Bosons from Spins of Heavy Quasars via Superradiance</title>

Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the curvature and some properties of the neutron star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.13673v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the general theory of relativity, a massive body induces curvature in the surrounding spacetime. In this study, the surface curvature (SC) of neutron stars is computed using various curvature quantities derived from the relativistic mean-field, density-dependent RMF, and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock equations of states. Neutron star properties, including mass, radius, compactness, and central density, are calculated utilizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. The analysis reveals a significant cubic correlation between the SC and compactness for the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99, indicating an almost linear relationship. A similarly significant inverse cubic correlation is observed between the SC and the radius of the canonical star. However, these correlations diminish for the maximum mass NS. Furthermore, a universal relation between the SC and the dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) for the canonical neutron star is established. Using the tidal deformability constraint of GW170817 ($\Lambda_{1.4} = 190_{-120}^{+390}$), the surface curvature is limited to SC$_{1.4} (10^{14}) = 2.87^{+0.30}_{-0.78}$ at a confidence level 90\%. Furthermore, the tidal deformability constraint of the secondary component in the GW190814 event ($\Lambda_{1.4} = 616_{-158}^{+273}$) offers a more stringent limit, with the result of SC$_{1.4} (10^{14}) = 2.03^{+0.27}_{-0.36}$. These findings indicate that the GW190814 event imposes more rigorous constraints on SC compared to GW170817.</description>

      <title>Exploring hidden priors when interpreting gravitational wave and electromagnetic probes of the nuclear equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wide range of sub- and super-nuclear densities achieved in neutron stars makes them ideal probes of dense nuclear behavior in the form of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Studying neutron stars both in isolation and in highly dynamic events, many recent observations, most famously the gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals associated with the BNS merger GW170817/AT2017gfo, have provided suggestive insight into these highest nuclear densities. Measurements of galactic neutron star masses and radii from NICER and other radio and X-ray measurements provide critical complementary perspectives, bounding other features of the EoS. Though nominally congruent, in this paper we highlight many underappreciated "hidden" priors embedded in joint analysis of these many messengers, and their systematic impact on joint EoS inference. In this work, we perform a careful step-by-step Bayesian inference using a simple low-dimensional parametric EoS model, incrementally adding information from galactic pulsars, gravitational wave sources, and more speculative constraints involving kilonovae and the neutron star maximum mass. At each stage, we carefully discuss the marginal likelihood, explaining how hidden priors impact conclusions. Conversely, we also quantify how much information these measurements have, arguing that many if not most have minimal impact relative to the explicit and hidden prior assumptions. Specifically, we find two features dominate our inference: on the one hand, the choice of EoS parameterization and particularly hyperprior, and on the other the astrophysical priors associated with interpreting events, particularly the multimessenger source GW170817. In an appendix, we outline a simple semianalytic projection suitable for assessing the measurability of the EoS with ensembles of present and future detections.</description>

Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If these dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <title>How a Space-Time Singularity Helps Remove the Ultraviolet Divergence Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle creation terms in quantum Hamiltonians are usually ultraviolet divergent and thus mathematically ill defined. A rather novel way of solving this problem is based on imposing so-called interior-boundary conditions on the wave function. Previous papers showed that this approach works in the non-relativistic regime, but particle creation is mostly relevant in the relativistic case after all. In flat relativistic space-time (that is, neglecting gravity), the approach was previously found to work only for certain somewhat artificial cases. Here, as a way of taking gravity into account, we consider curved space-time, specifically the super-critical Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, which features a naked timelike singularity. We find that the interior-boundary approach works fully in this setting; in particular, we prove rigorously the existence of well-defined, self-adjoint Hamiltonians with particle creation at the singularity, based on interior-boundary conditions. We also non-rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Bohmian trajectories and construct the corresponding Bohm-Bell process of particle creation, motion, and annihilation. The upshot is that in quantum physics, a naked space-time singularity need not lead to a breakdown of physical laws, but on the contrary allows for boundary conditions governing what comes out of the singularity and thereby removing the ultraviolet divergence.</description>

Abstract: We review a General Relativistic (GR) method to determine the black hole (BH) parameters: mass-to-distance ratio, position and recessional velocity of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of Seyfert type, which have an accretion disk with water masers circulating around the BH. This GR method makes use of astrophysical observations: the redshifted and the blueshifted photons emitted from the aforementioned masers and their orbital position on the sky. In order to perform the estimations we implement a Bayesian statistical method to fit the above mentioned observational data. One of the main results of this work consists in analytically expressing the gravitational redshift, allowing us to quantify its magnitude for the photons emitted by the closest masers to the black holes. We present this quantity for several BHs hosted at the core of AGNs.</description>

Abstract: The Hawking-Moss (HM) bounce solution implies that the tunneling amplitude between vacua is uniquely determined by the vacuum energy at the initial vacuum and the top of a potential barrier, regardless of the field distance between them $\Delta \phi$. This implausible conclusion was carefully discussed in [E. J. Weinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 251303, (2007)], and it was concluded that the conventional HM amplitude is not reliable for a transition to the top of distant local maxima (hereinafter referred to as the remote HM transition). We revisit this issue and study the impact of the quantum tunneling effect on the remote HM transition. We demonstrate that the amplitude for such a distant transition is indeed smaller than the conventional HM amplitude by employing the Lorentzian path integral in a simple setup. We consider a linear potential, which allows for analytic treatments, and evaluate the up-tunneling probability of a homogeneous scalar field in de Sitter spacetime. The Picard-Lefschetz theory is employed to identify the relevant Lefschetz thimble, representing the relevant tunneling trajectory. We then compare the resulting transition amplitude with the conventional HM amplitude. We find that when the field separation $|\Delta \phi|$ is larger, the quantum-tunneling amplitude, estimated by our Lorentzian path integral, is smaller than that of the conventional HM amplitude. This implies that the transition amplitude may be significantly suppressed if the thermal interpretation is not applicable and the quantum-tunneling effect is dominant for the remote HM transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the spin-2 nature of gravity, we consider a theory of N interacting spin-2 fields, formulated in terms of vielbeins which have been argued to be free of the Boulware-Deser ghost. This is the only known such theory with nontrivial multi-field interactions. We develop an all-order expansion of the vielbein in terms of the metric and Lorentz field perturbations, enabling an expansion of the action in arbitrary backgrounds to any order. The mass matrix is then analysed around proportional vielbein solutions corresponding to vacuum Einstein spacetimes. It is shown that the theory exhibits a non-tachyonic spectrum with one massless and N-1 massive spin-2 modes, regardless of the sign of the cosmological constant. While the massless mode is universal, the non-zero masses cannot generally be determined analytically, but we obtain the lower and upper bounds on each mass eigenvalue in terms of the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>A so(2,2) extension of JT gravity via the Virasoro-Kac-Moody semidirect product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a bulk plus boundary extension of Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity (JT) coupled with non-abelian gauge fields. The generalization is performed in the Poisson Sigma Model formulation and it is derived as a dimensional reduction of the AdS3 Chern-Simons theory with WZW boundary terms. We discuss the role of boundary conditions in relation to the symmetries of the boundary dynamics and we show that the boundary action can be written in terms of coadjoint orbits of an appropriate Virasoro Kac-Moody group. We obtain a Schwarzian action and interaction terms with additional edge modes that match the effective low energy action of recent SYK-like tensor models.</description>

      <title>Non-metricity approach to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity based on a non-metricity tensor. In symmetric teleparallel gravity, we often use the scalar quantity $Q$ composed of the bilinear terms of the non-metricity tensor but $Q$ is not a unique scalar quantity from the viewpoint of covariance. However, other scalar quantities composed of the non-metricity tensor generate ghosts in general. In two dimensions, because a propagating gravitational mode does not exist, if we consider general scalar quantities, there might appear any propagating modes although these modes are often ghosts. We consider a general combination of the terms given by the bi-linear of the non-metricity tensors. After finding the condition that the conformal form of the metric is compatible with the coincident gauge, where connections vanish, we determine the combination so that a solution with constant curvature exists. The obtained model corresponds to 2d JT gravity in the framework of the symmetric teleparallel gravity. The conformal mode propagates as a scalar in this theory and we also consider the condition that the scalar mode is not a ghost.</description>

      <title>Novel topological classes in black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By viewing black hole solutions as topological defects in thermodynamic parameter space, we unveil a novel topological class and two new topological subclasses, respectively denoted $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, $\overline{W}^{1+}$, and $\hat{W}^{1+}$, that extend beyond the four established categories proposed by Wei et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)]. Within the newly identified class and these two novel subclasses, the innermost small black hole states exhibit a distinct sequence of unstable, stable, and stable behaviours, while the outermost large black hole states display a uniform pattern of stable behaviours. These classifications indicate thermodynamic properties in both the low and high Hawking temperature regimes that are strikingly different from the previously known four topological classes. In particular, we demonstrate that static charged AdS black holes in gauged supergravity exhibit an intricate thermodynamic evolution that is notably distinct from that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole. From a topological perspective, we emphasize the advantages and potential of investigating thermodynamic phase transitions in these black hole spacetimes, an area that has been rarely explored in previous research. Our findings not only enrich and sharpen the framework of topological classifications in black hole thermodynamics, but also represent a significant stride toward unraveling the fundamental nature of black holes and gravity.</description>

      <title>Komar charge of N = 2 supergravity and its superspace generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the defining equations for a Killing vector and its superpartner (called the generalized Killing spinor) and use them to construct the generalized Komar superform of minimal N=2, d=4 supergravity using the superspace formulation. The superspace procedure presented here can be used for the construction of generalized Komar forms in more general supergravity theories. We also present the (more cumbersome) calculation of the generalized Komar 2-form and of the on-shell closed 2-form used to prove the first law in the component formalism, as an independent confirmation of our main result.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>
