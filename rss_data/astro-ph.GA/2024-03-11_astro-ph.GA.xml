      <title>Violent starbursts and quiescence induced by FUV radiation feedback in metal-poor galaxies at high-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim 8$ suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at sub-pc resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., $\mathrm{H_2}$ dissociating radiation) from Pop II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous, but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm ($\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$) until they reach a relatively high density ($\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder ($\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We, therefore, observe exceptionally bright galaxies (ten times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched "dead" galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myrs.</description>

      <title>Measuring Dwarf Galaxy Intrinsic Abundance Scatter with Mid-resolution Spectroscopic Surveys: Calibrating APOGEE Abundance Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generations of stars left their chemical fingerprints on metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and its surrounding dwarf galaxies. While instantaneous and homogeneous enrichment implies that groups of co-natal stars should have the same element abundances, small amplitudes of abundance scatter are seen at fixed [Fe/H]. Measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter have been made with small, high-resolution spectroscopic datasets where measurement uncertainty is small compared to this scatter. In this work, we present a method to use mid-resolution survey data, which has larger errors, to make this measurement. Using APOGEE DR17, we calculate the intrinsic scatter of Al, O, Mg, Si, Ti, Ni, and Mn relative to Fe for 333 metal-poor stars across 6 classical dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, and 1604 stars across 19 globular clusters. We first calibrate the reported abundance errors in bins of signal-to-noise and [Fe/H] using a high-fidelity halo dataset. We then apply these calibrated errors to the APOGEE data, and find small amplitudes of average intrinsic abundance scatter in dwarf galaxies ranging from 0.032 $-$ 0.14 dex with a median value of 0.043 dex. For the globular clusters, we find intrinsic scatters ranging from 0.018 $-$ 0.21 dex, with particularly high scatter for Al and O. Our measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter place important upper limits on the intrinsic scatter in these systems, as well as constraints on their underlying star formation history and mixing, that we can look to simulations to interpret.</description>

      <title>Star formation beyond galaxies: widespread in-situ formation of intra-cluster stars in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fraction of the intra-cluster light (ICL) formed in-situ in the three most massive clusters of the TNG50 simulation, with virial masses $\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find that a significant fraction of ICL stars ($8\%$-$28\%$) are born in-situ. This amounts to a total stellar mass comparable to the central galaxy itself. Contrary to simple expectations, only a sub-dominant fraction of these in-situ ICL stars are born in the central regions and later re-distributed to more energetic orbits during mergers. Instead, many in-situ ICL stars form directly hundreds of kiloparsecs away from the central galaxy, in clouds condensing out of the circum-cluster medium. The simulations predict a present-date diffuse star formation rate of $\sim$1 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$/yr, with higher rates at higher redshifts. The diffuse star forming component of the ICL is filamentary in nature, extends for hundreds of kiloparsecs and traces the distribution of neutral gas in the cluster host halo. We discuss briefly how numerical details of the baryonic treatment in the simulation may play a role in this result and conclude that a sensitivity of $1.6 \times 10^{-19} - 2.6 \times 10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ in H$_\alpha$ flux (beyond current observational capabilities) would be necessary to detect this diffuse star-forming component in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Complex angular structure of three elliptical galaxies from high-resolution ALMA observations of strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale mass distributions of strong-lensing galaxies have long been assumed to be well-described by a singular ellipsoidal power-law density profile with external shear. However, the inflexibility of this model could lead to systematic errors in astrophysical parameters inferred with gravitational lensing observables. Here, we present observations with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) of three strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies at $\simeq30$ mas angular resolution and investigate the sensitivity of these data to angular structure in the lensing galaxies. We jointly infer the lensing mass distribution and the full surface brightness of the lensed sources with multipole expansions of the power-law density profile up to fourth order using a technique developed for interferometric data. All three data sets strongly favour third and fourth-order multipole amplitudes of $\approx1$ percent of the convergence. While the infrared stellar isophotes and isodensity shapes agree for one lens system, for the other two the isophotes disagree to varying extents, suggesting contributions to the angular structure from dark matter intrinsic or extrinsic to the lensing galaxy.</description>

      <title>The TELPERION survey for extended emission regions around AGN: a strongly-interacting and merging galaxy sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for Extended Emission-Line Regions (EELRs) ionized by extant or recently-faded active galactic nuclei (AGN), using [O III] narrowband imaging and spectroscopic followup. The sample includes 198 galaxies in 92 strongly interacting or merging galaxy systems in the range z=0.009-0.0285. Among these, three have EELRs extended beyond 10 kpc in projection from the nucleus detected in previous studies. We identify a single new distant emission region, projected 35 kpc from UGC 5941. Our optical spectrum does not detect He II, but its strong-line ratios put this in the same class as securely characterized EELR clouds. The nucleus of UGC 5941 is dominated by recent star formation, preventing detection of any weak ongoing AGN. Overall counts of distant EELRs in this and the previous TELPERION samples give incidence 2-5% depending on galaxy and AGN selection, 20-50 times higher than the Galaxy Zoo EELR survey with its higher surface-brightness threshold and much larger input sample. AGN in interacting and merging systems have an increased detection rate $12+/-6$%, while none are detected around noninteracting AGN. Some of these AGN are at luminosity low enough to require additional X-ray or far-infrared information to tell whether the EELR ionization level suggests long-term fading.</description>

      <title>PHANGS-HST catalogs for $\sim$100,000 star clusters and compact associations in 38 galaxies: I. Observed properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest catalog to-date of star clusters and compact associations in nearby galaxies. We have performed a V-band-selected census of clusters across the 38 spiral galaxies of the PHANGS-HST Treasury Survey, and measured integrated, aperture-corrected NUV-U-B-V-I photometry. This work has resulted in uniform catalogs that contain $\sim$20,000 clusters and compact associations which have passed human inspection and morphological classification, and a larger sample of $\sim$100,000 classified by neural network models. Here, we report on the observed properties of these samples, and demonstrate that tremendous insight can be gained from just the observed properties of clusters, even in the absence of their transformation into physical quantities. In particular, we show the utility of the UBVI color-color diagram, and the three principal features revealed by the PHANGS-HST cluster sample: the young cluster locus, the middle-age plume, and the old globular cluster clump. We present an atlas of maps of the 2D spatial distribution of clusters and compact associations in the context of the molecular clouds from PHANGS-ALMA. We explore new ways of understanding this large dataset in a multi-scale context by bringing together once-separate techniques for the characterization of clusters (color-color diagrams and spatial distributions) and their parent galaxies (galaxy morphology and location relative to the galaxy main sequence). A companion paper presents the physical properties: ages, masses, and dust reddenings derived using improved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques.</description>

      <title>The Local Bubble is a Local Chimney: A New Model from 3D Dust Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging a high-resolution 3D dust map of the solar neighborhood from Edenhofer et al. (2023), we derive a new 3D model for the dust-traced surface of the Local Bubble, the supernova-driven cavity surrounding the Sun. We find that the surface of the Local Bubble is highly irregular in shape, with its peak extinction surface falling at an average distance of 170 pc from the Sun (spanning 70-600+ pc) with a typical thickness of 35 pc and a total dust-traced mass of $(6.0 \pm 0.7) \times 10^5 \ \rm{M}_{\odot}$. The Local Bubble displays an extension in the Galactic Northern hemisphere that is morphologically consistent with representing a "Local Chimney." We argue this chimney was likely created by the "bursting" of this supernova-driven superbubble, leading to the funneling of interstellar medium ejecta into the lower Galactic halo. We find that many well-known dust features and molecular clouds fall on the surface of the Local Bubble and that several tunnels to other adjacent cavities in the interstellar medium may be present. Our new, parsec-resolution view of the Local Bubble may be used to inform future analysis of the evolution of nearby gas and young stars, the investigation of direct links between the solar neighborhood and the Milky Way's lower halo, and numerous other applications.</description>

      <title>Morphological evolution of disk galaxies and their concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) properties in simulations across Toomre's $Q$ parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the morphological and structural evolutions of disk galaxies in simulations for a wide range of Toomre's $Q$ parameter. In addition to the inspection of conventional bar modes, we compute the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) parameters to enlarge the understanding of the galaxy evolution. These parameters are widely employed to analyze the light distribution of the observed galaxies, but the adaptation to numerical simulations is not much considered. While the bar formation takes place in a considerable range of $Q$ around $1$, barred galaxies originating from $Q&gt;1$ and $Q&lt;1$ disks yield the CAS values that differ significantly. Disks starting with $Q&lt;1$ develop clumps due to local gravitational instabilities along with the bar and these clumps play a central role in enhancing the CAS values. That process is absent in $Q&gt;1$ counterparts in which the evolution is dominated by linearly unstable two-armed modes that lead to lower CAS values. Likewise, unbarred galaxies that are obtainable from disks with $Q$ far below and far above $1$ exhibit greatly different CAS magnitudes. It turns out that the CAS parameters can serve as indicators of the initial kinematical state and the evolution history of a disk of any morphology. In addition, we find an alternative mechanism of the formation of the lopsided barred galaxy when $Q\lesssim 1$. Bars that evolve in the midst of the clumps can spontaneously become lopsided at the end.</description>

      <title>Infrared Emission of Specific Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules: Cyanonaphthalenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unidentified infrared emission (UIE) features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 micron are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions and commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, the unambiguous identification of any individual, specific PAH molecules has proven elusive until very recently two isomers of cyanonapthalene, which consists of two fused benzene rings and substitutes a nitrile (-CN) group for a hydrogen atom, were discovered in the Taurus Molecular Cloud based on their rotational transitions at radio frequencies. To facilitate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for cyanonapthalenes in astrophysical regions, we model the vibrational excitation of cyanonapthalenes and calculate their infrared emission spectra in a number of representative astrophysical regions. The model emission spectra and intensities will allow JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundance of cyanonapthalenes.</description>

      <title>Improving the open cluster census. III. Using cluster masses, radii, and dynamics to create a cleaned open cluster catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The census of open clusters has exploded in size thanks to data from the Gaia satellite. However, it is likely that many of these reported clusters are not gravitationally bound, making the open cluster census impractical for many scientific applications. We test different physically motivated methods for distinguishing between bound and unbound clusters, using them to create a cleaned cluster catalogue. We derived completeness-corrected photometric masses for 6956 clusters from our earlier work. Then, we used these masses to compute the size of the Roche surface of these clusters (their Jacobi radius) and distinguish between bound and unbound clusters. We find that only 5647 (79%) of the clusters from our previous catalogue are compatible with bound open clusters, dropping to just 11% of clusters within 250 pc. 3530 open clusters are in a strongly cut high quality sample. The moving groups in our sample show different trends in their size as a function of age and mass, suggesting that they are unbound and undergoing different dynamical processes. Our cluster mass measurements constitute the largest catalogue of Milky Way cluster masses to date, which we also use for further science. Firstly, we inferred the mass-dependent completeness limit of the open cluster census, showing that the census is complete within 1.8 kpc only for objects heavier than 230 M$_\odot$. Next, we derived a completeness-corrected age and mass function for our open cluster catalogue, including estimating that the Milky Way contains a total of $1.3 \times 10^5$ open clusters, only ~4% of which are currently known. Finally, we show that most open clusters have mass functions compatible with the Kroupa initial mass function. We demonstrate Jacobi radii for distinguishing between bound and unbound star clusters, and publish an updated star cluster catalogue with masses and improved cluster classifications.

      <title>Complex organic molecules uncover deeply embedded precursors of hot cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the process of star formation, the dense gas undergoes significant chemical evolution leading to the emergence of a rich variety of molecules associated with hot cores and hot corinos. However, the physical and chemical conditions involved in this evolution are poorly constrained. We provide here a full inventory of the emission from complex organic molecules (COMs) to investigate the physical structure and chemical composition of six high-mass protostellar envelopes. We aim to investigate the conditions for the emergence of COMs in hot cores. We performed an unbiased spectral survey towards six infrared-quiet massive clumps between 159 GHz and 374 GHz with the APEX 12 m telescope. We detect up to 11 COMs, of which at least five COMs are detected towards all sources. Towards all the objects, most of the COM emission is found to be cold, with respect to the typical temperatures at which COMs are found, with a temperature of 30 K and extended with a size of ~0.3 pc. Although for our sample of young massive clumps the bulk of the gas has a cold temperature, we also detect emission from COMs originating from the immediate vicinity of the protostar revealing a compact and hot component of the envelope. Only three out of the six sources exhibit a hot gas component. We find a gradual emergence of the warm component in terms of size and temperature, together with an increasing molecular complexity, allowing us to establish an evolutionary sequence for our sample based on COMs. Our findings confirm that our sample of infrared-quiet massive clumps are in an early evolutionary stage during which the bulk of the gas is cold. The presence of COMs is found to be characteristic of these early evolutionary stages. We suggest that the emergence of hot cores is preceded by a phase in which mostly O-bearing COMs appear first with similar abundances to hot corinos albeit with larger source sizes.</description>

      <title>JWST's first glimpses of a z &gt; 2 forming cluster reveals a top-heavy stellar mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters and their progenitors (protoclusters) at z = 2-4, the peak epoch of star formation, are ideal laboratories to study the formation process of both the clusters themselves and their member galaxies. However, a complete census of their member galaxies has been challenging due to observational difficulties. Here we present new JWST/NIRCam observations targeting the distant cluster CLJ1001 at z = 2.51 from the COSMOS-Webb program, which, in combination with previous narrow-band imaging targeting H-alpha emitters and deep millimeter surveys of CO-emitters, provide a complete view of massive galaxy assembly in CLJ1001. In particular, JWST reveals a population of massive, extremely red cluster members in the long-wavelength bands that were invisible in previous HST/F160W imaging (HST-dark). Based on this highly complete spectroscopic sample of member galaxies, we show that the spatial distribution of galaxies in CLJ1001 exhibits a strong central concentration, with the central galaxy density already resembling that of low-z clusters. Moreover, we reveal a ``top-heavy" stellar mass function for the star-forming galaxies (SFGs), with an overabundance of massive SFGs piled up in the cluster core. These features strongly suggest that CLJ1001 is caught in a rapid transition, with many of its massive SFGs likely soon becoming quiescent. In the context of cluster formation, these findings suggest that the earliest clusters form from the inside out and top to bottom, with the massive galaxies in the core assembling first, followed by the less-massive ones in the outskirts.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of extreme emission-line galaxies at $z\sim 4-9$ from the JWST CEERS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) are typically characterized by high equivalent widths (EWs) which are driven by elevated specific star formation rates (sSFR) in low-mass galaxies with subsolar metallicities and little dust. Such extreme systems are rare in the local universe, but the number density of EELGs increases with redshift. Such starburst galaxies are currently presumed to be the main drivers of hydrogen reionization over 5.5&lt;z&lt;15, which serves to motivate many of the searches for high-z EELGs. We aim to characterize the physical properties of a sample of ~730 EELGs at 4&lt;z&lt;9 photometrically selected from the CEERS survey using JWST/NIRCam. We validate our method and demonstrate the main physical properties of a subset of EELGs using NIRSpec spectra. We create synthetic NIRCam observations of EELGs using empirical templates based on ~2000 local metal-poor starbursts to select EELGs based on color-color criteria. We study their properties based on SED fitting and flux excess from emission lines in the photometric filters. Our sample has a mean stellar mass of $10^{7.84}$Msun with high sSFRs with a mean value of $10^{-7.03}$ yr$^{-1}$. We consider a delayed-$\tau$ model for the star formation history and find our sample of EELGs are young with a mean value of the time after the onset of star formation of 45Myr. We find that they have similar line ratios to local metal-poor starbursts with high log([OIII]/H$\beta$)&gt;0.4-1 which indicates that star formation may be the dominant source of ionization. Based on the photometric fluxes, we find an increase of EW([OIII]+H$\beta$) with sSFR and $\Sigma_{SFR}$, and a decrease with age and stellar mass. The sample of EELGs can reach $\Sigma_{SFR}&gt;$10Msun yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ which indicate they are strong candidates of LyC leakers. Another indirect indicator is the high values of O32&gt;5 that can be reached for some galaxies in the sample.</description>

Abstract: The Near-infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope is uniquely suited to studying galaxies in the distant Universe with its combination of multi-object capabilities and sensitivity over a large range in wavelength (0.6-5.3 microns). Here we present the NIRSpec Wide survey, part of the NIRSpec Instrument Science Team's Guaranteed Time Observations, using NIRSpec's microshutter array to obtain spectra of more than 3200 galaxies at $z&gt;1$ at both low- and high-resolution ($R\approx100$ and 2700) for a total of 105 hours. With 31 pointings covering $\approx$320 arcmin$^2$ across the five CANDELS fields with exquisite ancillary photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope, the NIRSpec Wide survey represents a fast and efficient way of using JWST to probe galaxies in the early Universe. Pointing centers are determined to maximize the observability of the rarest, high-value sources. Subsequently, the microshutter configurations are optimized to observe the maximum number of "census" galaxies with a selection function based primarily on HST/F160W magnitude, photometric/slitless grism redshift, and predicted \ha\ flux tracing the bulk of the galaxy population at cosmic noon ($z_{\rm med}=2.0$). We present details on the survey strategy, the target selection, an outline of the motivating science cases, and discuss upcoming public data releases to the community.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Highly-Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binaries in the Milli-hertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many gravitational wave (GW) sources are expected to have non-negligible eccentricity in the millihertz band. These highly eccentric compact object binaries may commonly serve as a progenitor stage of GW mergers, particularly in dynamical channels where environmental perturbations bring a binary with large initial orbital separation into a close pericenter passage, leading to efficient GW emission and a final merger. This work examines the stochastic GW background from highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$), stellar-mass sources in the mHz band. Our findings suggest that these binaries can contribute a substantial GW power spectrum, potentially exceeding the LISA instrumental noise at $\sim 3-7$~mHz. This stochastic background is likely to be dominated by eccentric sources within the Milky Way, thus introducing anisotropy and time dependence in LISA's detection. However, given efficient search strategies to identify GW transients from highly eccentric binaries, the unresolvable noise level can be substantially lower, approaching $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude below the LISA noise curve. Therefore, we highlight the importance of characterizing stellar-mass GW sources with extreme eccentricity, especially their transient GW signals in the millihertz band.</description>

      <title>The 21-cm signal during the end stages of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the 21-cm signal allows direct observation of the neutral hydrogen (\hi{}) in the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the post-reionization era, this signal instead probes \hi{} in galaxies, which traces the dark matter density distribution. With new numerical simulations, we investigated the end stages of reionization to elucidate the transition of our Universe into the post-reionization era. Our models are consistent with the latest high-redshift measurements, including ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions. Notably, these models consistently reproduced the evolution of the UV photon background, which is constrained from Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra. We studied the dependence of this background on the nature of photon sinks in the IGM, requiring mean free path of UV photons to be $\sim$10 comoving-megaparsecs (cMpc) during the EoR that increases gradually with time during late stages ($z\lesssim 6$). Our models revealed that the reionization of the IGM transitioned from an \textit{inside-out} to an \textit{outside-in} process when the Universe is less than 0.01 per cent neutral. During this epoch, the 21-cm signal also shifted from probing predominantly the \hi{} in the IGM to that in galaxies. Furthermore, we identified a statistically significant number of large neutral islands (with sizes up to 40 cMpc) persisting until very late stages ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$) that can imprint features in Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra and also produce a knee-like feature in the 21-cm power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Proper motion of Cygnus loop shock filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determined shock speed in the Galactic supernova remnant Cygnus Loop, using proper motion of its optical filaments and the latest estimate for its distance. The proper motion was measured by comparing H$\alpha$ images of the remnant observed in two epochs: 1993 (Kitt Peak National Observatory) and 2018/2019 (National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen and Astronomical station Vidojevica). We derived shock speed for 35 locations along different filaments, which is twice as much as in earlier studies of north-eastern part of Cygnus Loop. For the first time, we have measured shock speed of radiative filaments in this region. Three of the analyzed locations where we measured proper motion of filaments are radiative, based on their presence in [SII] images from the second epoch. The other filaments are non-radiative. The speed we obtained for the non-radiative filaments is in the range of 240-650 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, with an estimate for the uncertainty of 70 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. These values are mostly in agreement with previous studies. The radiative filaments have lower speed of 100-160$\pm${70} $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, which is in agreement with the assumption that they are older in evolutionary terms. This clear distinction between the speed of the two types of filaments proves that the [SII] emission can be used for identifying radiative filaments in supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Using Gaussian Processes to detect AGN flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key feature of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is their variability across all wavelengths. Typically, AGN vary by a few tenths of a magnitude or more over periods lasting from hours to years. By contrast, extreme variability of AGN -- large luminosity changes that are a significant departure from the baseline variability -- are known as AGN flares. These events are rare and their timescales poorly constrained, with most of the literature focusing on individual events. It has been suggested that extreme AGN variability including flares can provide insights into the accretion processes in the disk. With surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) promising millions of transient detections per night in the coming decade, there is a need for fast and efficient classification of AGN flares. The problem with the systematic detection of AGN flares is the requirement to detect them against a stochastically variable baseline; the ability to define a signal as a significant departure from the ever-present variability is a statistical challenge. Recently, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have revolutionised the analysis of time-series data in many areas of astronomical research. They have, however, seen limited uptake within the field of transient detection and classification. Here we investigate the efficacy of Gaussian Processes to detect AGN flares in both simulated and real optical light curves. We show that GP analysis can successfully detect AGN flares with a false-positive rate of less than seven per cent, and we present examples of AGN light curves that show extreme variability.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.

      <title>Modelling Triatomic Biosignatures: Ozone and Isotopomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new approach to produce spectroscopic constants and model first-principles synthetic spectra for all molecules of astrophysical interest. We have generalized our previous diatomic molecule simulation framework, employing Transition-Optimised Shifted Hermite (TOSH) theory, thereby enabling the modelling of polyatomic rotational constants for molecules with three or more atoms. These capabilities, are now provided by our new code Epimetheus.
  As a first validation of our approach, we confront our predictions and assess their accuracy against the well-studied triatomic molecule, ozone 666 ($^{16}$O$_3$), in addition to eight of its potential isotopomers: ozone 668 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 686 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{16}$O), 667 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{17}$O), 676 ($^{16}$O$^{17}$O$^{16}$O), 688 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{18}$O), 868 ($^{18}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 888 ($^{18}$O$_3$), and 777 ($^{17}$O$_3$). We then assess the accuracy of these rotational constants using the Epimetheus data in our code Pandora, and generate synthetic molecular spectra.
  The ozone spectra presented here are purely infrared and not Raman. Epimetheus builds upon the work from our previous code Prometheus, which used the TOSH theory to account for anharmonicity for the fundamental $\nu=0 \rightarrow \nu=1$ band, going further to now account for triatomic molecules. This is combined with thermal profile modeling for the rotational transitions. We have found that this extended method performs promisingly, typically approximating the spectroscopic constants and spectra well. Some issues do arise depending on the symmetry group of the ozone isotopomer. In general, we show that Epimetheus can provide the data to produce appreciable molecular spectra, to help drive future high-resolution studies.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of Galactic magnetic fields using Information Field Theory: The inclusion of line-of-sight information in ultra-high energy cosmic ray backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extremely energetic charged particles with energies surpassing $10^{18}$ eV. Their sources remain elusive, obscured by deflections caused by the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). This challenge is further complicated by our limited understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the GMF, as current GMF observations consist primarily of quantities integrated along the line-of-sight (LOS). Nevertheless, data from upcoming stellar polarisation surveys along with Gaia's stellar parallax data are expected to yield local GMF measurements.. In this work, we employ methods of Bayesian statistical inference in order to sample the posterior distribution of the GMF within part of the Galaxy. By assuming a known rigidity and arrival direction of an UHECR, we backtrack its trajectory through various GMF configurations drawn from the posterior distribution. Our objective is to rigorously evaluate our algorithm's performance in scenarios that closely mirror the setting of expected future applications. In pursuit of this, we condition the posterior to synthetic integrated LOS measurements of the GMF, in addition to synthetic local POS-component measurements. In this proof of concept work, we assume the ground truth to be a magnetic field produced by a dynamo simulation of the Galactic ISM. Our results demonstrate that for all locations of the observed arrival direction on the POS, our algorithm is able to substantially update our knowledge on the original arrival direction of UHECRs with rigidity $E/Z = 5 \times 10^{19}$ eV, even in the case of complete absence of LOS information. If integrated data is included in the inference, then the regions of the celestial sphere where the maximum error occurs diminishes greatly. Even in those regions the maximum error is diminished by a factor of about $3$ in the specific setting studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Gaia observations suggest that some hypervelocity stars (HVSs) might originate from outside the Galaxy. We ask if these HVSs could come from as far as Andromeda. Therefore, we simulate HVSs originating in Andromeda with initial conditions based on attributes of high-velocity stars measured in the Milky Way and a simple model for the gravitational potential of Andromeda and the Milky Way. We evaluate the validity of this scenario based on the simulation results. While we expect the vast majority of HVSs in our Galaxy will originate here, we expect the number of stars present from Andromeda at any one time to be between twelve and 3910, depending upon model assumptions. Further, we analyse the properties of HVSs that are able to reach the Milky Way. We discuss whether they could be detected experimentally based on recent constraints set on the ejection rate of HVSs from the Milky Way centre</description>

      <title>CECILIA: The Faint Emission Line Spectrum of z~2-3 Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results from CECILIA, a Cycle 1 JWST NIRSpec/MSA program that uses ultra-deep ~30 hour G235M/F170LP observations to target multiple electron temperature-sensitive auroral lines in the spectra of 33 galaxies at z~1-3. Using a subset of 23 galaxies, we construct two ~600 object-hour composite spectra, both with and without the stellar continuum, and use these to investigate the characteristic rest-optical (5700-8500 Angstrom) spectrum of star-forming galaxies at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. Emission lines of eight different elements (H, He, N, O, Si, S, Ar, and Ni) are detected, with most of these features observed to be &lt;3% the strength of H-alpha. We report the characteristic strength of three auroral lines ([NII]5756, [SIII]6313, and [OII]7322,7332), as well as other semi-strong and faint emission lines, including forbidden [NiII]7380,7414 and the OI 8449 recombination line, some of which have never before been observed outside of the local universe. Using these measurements, we find T_e[NII]=13630+/-2540 K, representing the first measurement of electron temperature using [NII] in the high-redshift universe. We also see evidence for broad line emission with a FWHM of ~536 km/s; the broad component of H-alpha is 6.01-28.31% the strength of the narrow component and likely arises from star-formation driven outflows. Finally, we briefly comment on the feasibility of obtaining large samples of faint emission lines using JWST in the future.</description>

Abstract: To test theoretical models of massive star formation it is important to compare their predictions with observed systems. To this end, we conduct CO molecular line radiative transfer post-processing of 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of various stages in the evolutionary sequence of a massive protostellar core, including its infall envelope and disk wind outflow. Synthetic position-position-velocity (PPV) cubes of various transitions of CO, 13CO, and C18O emission are generated. We also carry out simulated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of this emission. We compare the mass, momentum and kinetic energy estimates obtained from molecular lines to the true values, finding that the mass and momentum estimates can have uncertainties of up to a factor of four. However, the kinetic energy estimated from molecular lines is more significantly underestimated. Additionally, we compare the mass outflow rate and momentum outflow rate obtained from the synthetic spectra with the true values. Finally, we compare the synthetic spectra with real examples of ALMA-observed protostars and determine the best fitting protostellar masses and outflow inclination angles. We then calculate the mass outflow rate and momentum outflow rate for these sources, finding that both rates agree with theoretical protostellar evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Drivers of Electron Temperature Variations in HII Regions with Keck-KCWI and VLT-MUSE</title>

Abstract: HII region electron temperatures are a critical ingredient in metallicity determinations and recent observations reveal systematic variations in the temperatures measured using different ions. We present electron temperatures ($T_e$) measured using the optical auroral lines ([NII]$\lambda5756$, [OII]$\lambda\lambda7320,7330$, [SII]$\lambda\lambda4069,4076$, [OIII]$\lambda4363$, and [SIII]$\lambda6312$) for a sample of HII regions in seven nearby galaxies. We use observations from the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies survey (PHANGS) obtained with integral field spectrographs on Keck (Keck Cosmic Web Imager; KCWI) and the Very Large Telescope (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer; MUSE). We compare the different $T_e$ measurements with HII region and interstellar medium environmental properties such as electron density, ionization parameter, molecular gas velocity dispersion, and stellar association/cluster mass and age obtained from PHANGS. We find that the temperatures from [OII] and [SII] are likely over-estimated due to the presence of electron density inhomogeneities in HII regions. We observe that differences between [NII] and [SIII] temperatures are weakly correlated with stellar association mass and molecular gas velocity dispersion. We measure high [OIII] temperatures in a subset of regions with high molecular gas velocity dispersion and low ionization parameter, which may be explained by the presence of low-velocity shocks. In agreement with previous studies, the $T_{\rm{e}}$--$T_{\rm{e}}$ between [NII] and [SIII] temperatures have the lowest observed scatter and generally follow predictions from photoionization modeling, which suggests that these tracers reflect HII region temperatures across the various ionization zones better than [OII], [SII], and [OIII].</description>

      <title>Beware the recent past: a bias in spectral energy distribution modelling due to bursty star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the recovery of galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) using energy-balance spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes depends on their recent star formation histories (SFHs). We use the Magphys and Prospector codes to fit 6,706 synthetic spectral energy distributions of simulated massive galaxies at $1 &lt; z &lt; 8$ from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We identify a previously-unknown systematic error in the Magphys results due to bursty star formation: the derived SFRs can differ from the truth by as much as 1 dex, at large statistical significance ($&gt;5\sigma$), depending on the details of their recent SFH. SFRs inferred using Prospector with non-parametric SFHs do not exhibit this trend. We show that using parametric SFHs (pSFHs) causes SFR uncertainties to be underestimated by a factor of up to $5\times$. Although this undoubtedly contributes to the significance of the systematic, it cannot explain the largest biases in the SFRs of the starbursting galaxies, which could be caused by details of the stochastic prior sampling or the burst implementation in the Magphys libraries. We advise against using pSFHs and urge careful consideration of starbursts when SED modelling galaxies where the SFR may have changed significantly over the last ~100 Myr, such as recently quenched galaxies, or those experiencing a burst. This concern is especially relevant, e.g. when fitting JWST observations of very high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Cloud-cloud collisions triggering star formation in galaxy simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-cloud collisions (CCCs) are expected to compress gas and trigger star formation. However, it is not well understood how the collisions and the induced star formation affect galactic-scale properties. By developing an on-the-fly algorithm to identify CCCs at each timestep in a galaxy simulation and a model that relates CCC-triggered star formation to collision speeds, we perform simulations of isolated galaxies to study the evolution of galaxies and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with prescriptions of self-consistent CCC-driven star formation and stellar feedback. We find that the simulation with the CCC-triggered star formation produces slightly higher star formation rates and a steeper Kennicutt-Schmidt relation than that with a more standard star formation recipe, although collision speeds and frequencies are insensitive to the star formation models. In the simulation with the CCC model, about 70 per cent of the stars are born via CCCs, and colliding GMCs with masses of $\approx 10^{5.5}\,M_{\odot}$ are the main drivers of CCC-driven star formation. In the simulation with the standard star formation recipe, about 50 per cent of stars are born in colliding GMCs even without the CCC-triggered star formation model. These results suggest that CCCs may be one of the most important star formation processes in galaxy evolution. Furthermore, we find that a post-processing analysis of CCCs, as used in previous studies in galaxy simulations, may lead to slightly greater collision speeds and significantly lower collision frequencies than the on-the-fly analysis.</description>

      <title>Measuring the gas reservoirs in $10^{8}&lt;$ M$_\star&lt;10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ galaxies at $1\leq z\leq3$</title>

Abstract: Understanding the gas content in galaxies, its consumption and replenishment, remains pivotal in our comprehension of the evolution of the Universe. Numerous studies have addressed this, utilizing various observational tools and analytical methods. These include examining low-transition $^{12}$CO millimeter rotational lines and exploring the far-infrared and the (sub-)millimeter emission of galaxies. With the capabilities of present-day facilities, much of this research has been centered on relatively bright galaxies. We aim at exploring the gas reservoirs of a more general type of galaxy population at $1.0\leq z\leq 3.0$. We stack ALMA 1.1 mm data to measure the gas content of a mass-complete sample down to $\sim10^{8.6}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=1$ ($\sim10^{9.2}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=3$), extracted from the HST/CANDELS sample in GOODS-S. The sample is composed of 5,530 on average blue ($&lt;b-i&gt;\sim0.12$ mag, $&lt;i-H&gt;\sim0.81$ mag), star-forming main sequence objects ($\Delta$MS$\sim-0.03$). We report measurements at $10^{10-11}$ M$_\odot$ and upper limits for the gas fractions at $10^{8-10}$ M$_\odot$. At $10^{10-11}$ M$_\odot$, our f$_{\mathrm{gas}}$, ranging from 0.32 to 0.48, agree well with other studies based on mass-complete samples down to $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, and are lower than expected according to other works more biased to individual detections. At $10^{9-10}$ M$_\odot$, we obtain 3$\sigma$ upper limits for f$_{\mathrm{gas}}$ ranging from 0.69 to 0.77. These upper limits are on the level of the extrapolations of scaling relations based on mass-complete samples down to $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. As such, it suggests that the gas content of low-mass galaxies is at most what is extrapolated from literature scaling relations. The comparison of our results with previous works reflects how the inclusion of bluer, less obscured, and more MS-like objects progressively pushes the gas level to lower values.</description>

      <title>GOALS-JWST: Mid-Infrared Molecular Gas Excitation Probes the Local Conditions of Nuclear Star Clusters and the AGN in the LIRG VV 114</title>

Abstract: The enormous increase in mid-IR sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution provided by the JWST spectrographs enables, for the first time, detailed extragalactic studies of molecular vibrational bands. This opens an entirely new window for the study of the molecular interstellar medium in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). We present a detailed analysis of rovibrational bands of gas-phase CO, H$_2$O, C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN towards the heavily-obscured eastern nucleus of the LIRG VV 114, as observed by NIRSpec and MIRI MRS. Spectra extracted from apertures of 130 pc in radius show a clear dichotomy between the obscured AGN and two intense starburst regions. We detect the 2.3 $\mu$m CO bandheads, characteristic of cool stellar atmospheres, in the star-forming regions, but not towards the AGN. Surprisingly, at 4.7 $\mathrm{\mu}$m we find highly-excited CO ($T_\mathrm{ex} \approx 700-800$ K out to at least rotational level $J = 27$) towards the star-forming regions, but only cooler gas ($T_\mathrm{ex} \approx 200$ K) towards the AGN. We conclude that only mid-infrared pumping through the rovibrational lines can account for the equilibrium conditions found for CO and H$_2$O in the deeply-embedded starbursts. Here the CO bands probe regions with an intense local radiation field inside dusty young massive star clusters or near the most massive young stars. The lack of high-excitation molecular gas towards the AGN is attributed to geometric dilution of the intense radiation from the bright point source. An overview of the relevant excitation and radiative transfer physics is provided in an appendix.</description>

      <title>CECILIA: Direct O, N, S, and Ar Abundances in Q2343-D40, a Galaxy at $z\sim$3</title>

Abstract: Measurements of chemical abundances in high-$z$ star-forming (SF) galaxies place important constraints on the enrichment histories of galaxies and the physical conditions in the early universe. JWST is beginning to enable direct chemical abundance measurements in galaxies at $z$$&gt;$2 via the detection of the faint T$_e$-sensitive auroral line [O III]$\lambda$4364. However, abundances of other elements (e.g., S and Ar) in high-$z$ galaxies remain unconstrained due to a lack of T$_e$ data and wavelength coverage. Here, we present multiple direct abundances in Q2343-D40, a galaxy at $z=$2.9628$\pm$0.0001 observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the CECILIA program. We report the first simultaneous measurement of T$_e$[O III] and T$_e$[S III] in a high-$z$ galaxy, finding good agreement with the temperature trends in local SF systems. We measure a gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H) $=8.07\pm0.06$, and the N/O abundance, log(N/O) $=-1.37\pm0.21$, is indicative of primary nucleosynthesis. The S/O and Ar/O relative abundances, log(S/O)$=-1.88\pm0.10$ and log(Ar/O)$=-2.80\pm0.12$, are both $&gt;$0.3 dex lower than the solar ratios. However, the relative Ar$^{2+}$/S$^{2+}$ abundance is consistent with the solar ratio, suggesting that the relative S-to-Ar abundance does not evolve significantly with redshift. Recent nucleosynthesis models find that a significant amount of S and Ar are produced in Type Ia supernovae, such that the S/O and Ar/O abundances in Q2343-D40 could be the result of predominantly core-collapse supernovae enrichment. Future JWST observations of high-$z$ galaxies will uncover whether S/O and Ar/O are sensitive to the timescales of these different enrichment mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Reservoir of the Per-emb-2 Streamer</title>

Abstract: Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3mm and 7mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of $\sim0.04$ pc is located north with a distance of $\sim 20,500$ au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this north region which is the origin of the streamer. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ($n_{\rm {H}_2} \approx 1.9 \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\rm {kin}} = 10$ K), which are similar to those of early stage starless cores. By comparisons with the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC$_3$N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be $24-34$ M$_{\odot}$. If all of the gas in the reservoir will accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer has been estimated at ($1.1 - 3.2$)$\times10^{5}$ yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.</description>

      <title>Constraining the PG 1553+113 binary hypothesis: interpreting hints of a new, 22-year period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PG 1553+113 is a well-known blazar exhibiting evidence of a $\sim\! 2.2$-yr quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands. Since QPO mechanisms often predict multiple QPOs, we search for a second QPO in its historical optical light curve covering a century of observations. Despite challenging data quality issues, we find hints of a $21.8 \pm 4.7$ yr oscillation. On its own, this $\sim\! 22$-yr period has a modest statistical significance of $1.6\sigma$ when accounting for the look-elsewhere effect. However, the joint significance of both the $2.2$- and $22$-yr periods arising from colored noise alone is $\sim 3.6\sigma$. The next peak of the 22-yr oscillation is predicted to occur around July 2025. We find that such a $\sim\,$10:1 relation between two periods can arise in the gas dynamics of a plausible supermassive black hole binary model of PG 1553+113. While the 22-yr QPO is preliminary, an interpretation of PG 1553+113's two QPOs in this binary model suggests that the binary engine has a mass ratio $\gtrsim 0.2$, an eccentricity $\lesssim 0.1$, and accretes from a disk with characteristic aspect ratio $\sim 0.03$. The putative binary radiates nHz gravitational waves, but the amplitude is $\sim10-100$ times too low for detection by foreseeable pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Radiative Transfer Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation transfer equation is widely used for simulating such as heat transfer in engineering, diffuse optical tomography in healthcare, and radiation hydrodynamics in astrophysics. By combining the lattice Boltzmann method, we propose a quantum algorithm for radiative transfer. This algorithm encompasses all the essential physical processes of radiative transfer: absorption, scattering, and emission. Although a sufficient number of measurements are required to precisely estimate the quantum state, and the initial encoding of the quantum state remains a challenging problem, our quantum algorithm exponentially accelerates radiative transfer calculations compared to classical algorithms. In order to verify the quantum algorithm, we perform quantum circuit simulation using IBM Qiskit Aer and find good agreement between our numerical result and the exact solution. The algorithm opens new application of fault-tolerant quantum computers for plasma engineering, telecommunications, nuclear fusion technology, healthcare and astrophysics.</description>
