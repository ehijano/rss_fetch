      <title>Spectral Reciprocity and Hybrid Subconvexity Bound for triple product $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a number field with adele ring $\mathbb{A}_F$, $\pi_1, \pi_2$ be two unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$ with finite analytic conductor. We study the twisted first moment of the triple product $L$-function $L(\frac{1}{2}, \pi \otimes \pi_1 \otimes \pi_2)$ and the Hecke eigenvalues $\lambda_\pi (\mathfrak{l})$, where $\pi$ is a unitary automorphic representation of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$ and $\mathfrak{l}$ is an integral ideal coprimes with the finite analytic conductor $C(\pi \otimes \pi_1 \otimes \pi_2)$. The estimation becomes a reciprocity formula between different moments of $L$-functions. Combining with the ideas and estimations established in [HMN23] and [MV10], we study the subconvexity problem for the triple product $L$-function in the level aspect and give a new explicit hybrid subconvexity bound for $L(\frac{1}{2}, \pi \otimes \pi_1 \otimes \pi_2)$, allowing joint ramifications and conductor dropping range.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of integral fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of any polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient $c$. Inspired greatly by the elegance of counting problems along with the very striking results established by Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators in the area of arithmetic statistics and by an interesting point-counting result of Narkiewicz on rational periodic points of polynomial maps $\varphi_{d, c}$ in the area of arithmetic dynamics, we show that for any given prime integer $p\geq 3$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any map $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is either 3 or 0, as degree of $\varphi_{p, c}$ tends to infinity. Moreover, we also prove that only $0\%$ of monic integer polynomials $\varphi_{p, c}(x)$ have exactly three integral fixed points modulo $p$, as $c$ tends to infinity. Consequently, a density of $100\%$ of monic integer polynomials $f(x): = \varphi_{p, c}(x) - x$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ have an algebraic property that the quotient ring $\mathbb{Q}[x]\slash (f(x))$ is a degree-$p$ algebraic number field. A more recent density result of Bhargava-Shankar-Wang applied here on our irreducible monic integer polynomials $f(x)$, then shows that a density equal to $\zeta(2)^{-1}$ of polynomials $f(x)$ is such that $\mathbb{Z}[x]\slash (f(x))$ is the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}[x]\slash (f(x))$.</description>

      <title>Some classes of permutation pentanomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each prime p other than 3, and each power q=p^k, we present two large classes of permutation polynomials over F_{q^2} of the form X^r B(X^{q-1}) which have at most five terms, where B(X) is a polynomial with coefficients in {1,-1}. The special case p=2 of our results comprises a vast generalization of 76 recent results and conjectures in the literature. In case p&gt;2, no instances of our permutation polynomials have appeared in the literature, and the construction of such polynomials had been posed as an open problem. Our proofs are short and involve no computations, in contrast to the proofs of many of the special cases of our results which were published previously.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ and $p$ be prime numbers with $p \geq 5$ such that $p || (N + 1)$. In a previous paper, we showed that there is a cuspform $f$ of weight 2 and level $\Gamma_0(N^2)$ whose $\ell$-th Fourier coefficient is congruent to $\ell + 1$ modulo a prime above $p$ for all primes $\ell$. In this paper, we prove that this form $f$ is unique up to Galois conjugacy, and the extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ generated by the coefficients of $f$ is exactly $\mathbb{Z}_p[\zeta_p + \zeta_p^{-1}]$. We also prove similar results when a higher power of $p$ divides $N + 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H(n) = \prod_{p|n}\frac{p}{p-1}$ where $p$ ranges over the primes which divide $n$. It is well known that if $n$ is a primitive non-deficient number, then $H(n) &gt; 2$. We examine inequalities of the form $H(n)&gt; 2 + f(n)$ for various functions $f(n)$ where $n$ is assumed to be primitive non-deficient and connect these inequalities to applying the Kullback-Leibler divergence to different probability distributions on the set of divisors of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ denote the Liouville function for function fields. We prove that for a fixed $q$, given $h \ll \sqrt{N}$ and $h(N) \to \infty$ arbitrarily slowly as $N \to \infty$, then \begin{equation*} \frac{1}{q^N}\sum_{G_0 \in \mathcal{M}_N}|\sum_{G \in \mathcal{I}_{h}(G_0)}\lambda(G)|^2 \ll_q \frac{N^5}{h^2}q^{h}. \end{equation*} The proof follows a similar method of an analogous case in the integer setting developed by Chinis, adapting methods originally developed by Matom\"aki and Radziwi{\l}{\l}.</description>

      <title>New bounds in R.S. Lehman's estimates for the difference $\pi\left( x\right) -li\left( x\right) $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We denote by $\pi\left( x\right) $ the usual prime counting function and let $li\left( x\right) $ the logarithmic integral of $x$. In 1966, R.S. Lehman came up with a new approach and an effective method for finding an upper bound where it is assured that a sign change occurs for $\pi\left( x\right) -li\left( x\right) $ for some value $x$ not higher than this given bound. In this paper we provide further improvements on the error terms including an improvement upon Lehman's famous error term $S_{3}$ in his original paper. We are now able to eliminate the lower condition for the size-length $\eta$ completely. For further numerical computations this enables us to establish sharper results on the positions for the sign changes. We illustrate with some numerical computations on the lowest known crossover regions near $10^{316}$ and we discuss numerically on potential crossover regions below this value.</description>

      <title>Characterization of subfields of adelic algebras by a product formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider projective, irreducible, non-singular curves over an algebraically closed field $\k$. A cover $Y \to X$ of such curves corresponds to an extension $\Omega/\Sigma$ of their function fields and yields an isomorphism $\A_{Y} \simeq \A_{X} \otimes_{\Sigma} \Omega$ of their geometric adele rings. The primitive element theorem shows that $\A_{Y}$ is a quotient of $\A_{X}[T]$ by a polynomial.
  In general, we may look at quotient algebras $\AXp{\p} = \A_{X}[T]/(\p(T))$ where $\p(T) \in \A_{X}[T]$ is monic and separable over $\A_{X}$, and try to characterize the field extensions $\Omega/\Sigma$ lying in $\AXp{\p}$ which arise from covers as above. We achieve this topologically, namely, as those $\Omega$ which embed discretely in $\AXp{\p}$, and in terms of an additive analog of the product formula for global fields, a result which is reminiscent of classical work of Artin-Whaples and Iwasawa.
  The technical machinery requires studying which topology on $\AXp{\p}$ is natural for this problem. Local compactness no longer holds, but instead we have linear topologies defined by commensurability of $\k$-subspaces which coincide with the restricted direct product topology with respect to integral closures. The content function is given as an index measuring the discrepancy in commensurable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Rigidity in a Fixed Number Field and a Directional $p$-Adic Littlewood Conjecture for Algebraic Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X_n$ be the space of unimodular lattices in $\RR^n$ and let $A$ be the full diagonal group in $\on{SL}_n(\RR)$. It is known that compact $A$-orbits originate from moduls in totally real degree $n$ number fields. Our first result shows that for a natural family of compact orbits $(Ax_k)_k$ all originating from a fixed number field $K$, every weak limit of the Haar measures on those orbits $m_{Ax_k}$ must contain the Haar measure $m_{X_n}$ as an ergodic component. This result generalizes certain aspects of the work by Aka and Shapira in \cite{Shapira-Aka} to arbitrary dimensions, as well as elements from Shapira-Zheng in \cite{shapira2021translates}.
  For every vector $\overline \alpha\in \RR^n$ and for every rational approximation $(\overline p,q)\in \RR^n\times\RR$ we can associate the displacement vector $q\alpha-\overline p$. We focus on algebraic vectors, namely $\overline \alpha=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ span a rank $n$ number field. For these vectors, we investigate the size of their displacements as well as the distribution of their directions. We establish that algebraic vector $\overline \alpha$ satisfy the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture. Namely, we prove that \begin{equation}
  \liminf_{k \to \infty} \left( k \|k\|_p \right)^{1/n} \| k (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \|_\infty = 0. \end{equation} Additionally, we classify all limiting distributions, with a special weighting, of the sequence of directions of the defects in the $\varepsilon$-approximations of $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$. Each such limiting measure is expressed as the pushforward of an algebraic measure on $X_n$ to the sphere.
  Our proof relies on estimates of the asymptotic orders of units in fixed number fields modulo families of natural numbers and on rigidity results from \cite{ELMV1}.</description>

      <title>Distinguished Representations for $\rm{SL}_n(D)$ where $D$ is a quaternion division algebra over a $p$-adic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a quaternion division algebra over a non-archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic zero. Let $E/F$ be a quadratic extension and $\rm{SL}_{n}^{*}(E) = {\rm{GL}}_{n}(E) \cap \rm{SL}_{n}(D)$. We study distinguished representations of $\rm{SL}_{n}(D)$ by the subgroup $\rm{SL}_{n}^{*}(E)$. Let $\pi$ be an irreducible admissible representation of $\rm{SL}_{n}(D)$ which is distinguished by $\rm{SL}_{n}^{*}(E)$. We give a multiplicity formula, i.e. a formula for the dimension of the $\mathbb{C}$-vector space ${\rm{Hom}}_{\rm{SL}_{n}^{*}(E)} (\pi, \mathbbm{1})$, where $\mathbbm{1}$ denotes the trivial representation of $\rm{SL}_{n}^{*}(E)$. This work is a non-split inner form analog of a work by Anandavardhanan-Prasad which gives a multiplicity formula for $\rm{SL}_{n}(F)$-distinguished irreducible admissible representation of $\rm{SL}_{n}(E)$.</description>

      <title>Additive and geometric transversality of fractal sets in the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.05480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By juxtaposing ideas from fractal geometry and dynamical systems, Furstenberg proposed a series of conjectures in the late 1960's that explore the relationship between digit expansions with respect to multiplicatively independent bases. In this work, we introduce and study - in the discrete context of the integers - analogues of some of the notions and results surrounding Furstenberg's work. In particular, we define a new class of fractal sets of integers that parallels the notion of $\times r$-invariant sets on the 1-torus and investigate the additive and geometric independence between two such fractal sets when they are structured with respect to multiplicatively independent bases. Our main results in this direction parallel the works of Furstenberg, Hochman-Shmerkin, Shmerkin, Wu, and Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres and include:
  -a classification of all subsets of the positive integers that are simultaneously $\times r$- and $\times s$-invariant;
  -integer analogues of two of Furstenberg's transversality conjectures pertaining to the dimensions of the intersection $A\cap B$ and the sumset $A+B$ of $\times r$- and $\times s$-invariant sets $A$ and $B$ when $r$ and $s$ are multiplicatively independent; and
  -a description of the dimension of iterated sumsets $A+A+\cdots+A$ for any $\times r$-invariant set $A$.
  We achieve these results by combining ideas from fractal geometry and ergodic theory to build a bridge between the continuous and discrete regimes. For the transversality results, we rely heavily on quantitative bounds on the $L^q$-dimensions of projections of restricted digit Cantor measures obtained recently by Shmerkin. We end by outlining a number of open questions and directions regarding fractal subsets of the integers.</description>

      <title>Summation formulae for quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Poisson summation formula for the zero locus of a quadratic form in an even number of variables with no assumption on the support of the functions involved. The key novelty in the formula is that all ``boundary terms'' are given either by constants or sums over smaller quadrics related to the original quadric. We also discuss the link with the classical problem of estimating the number of solutions of a quadratic form in an even number of variables. To prove the summation formula we compute (the Arthur truncated) theta lift of the trivial representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$. As previously observed by Ginzburg, Rallis, and Soudry, this is an analogue for orthogonal groups on vector spaces of even dimension of the global Schr\"odinger representation of the metaplectic group.</description>

      <title>Large sieve inequalities for exceptional Maass forms and the greatest prime factor of $n^2+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new large sieve inequalities for the Fourier coefficients $\rho_{j\mathfrak{a}}(n)$ of exceptional Maass forms of a given level, weighted by sequences $(a_n)$ with sparse Fourier transforms - including two key types of sequences that arise in the dispersion method. These give the first savings in the exceptional spectrum for the critical case of sequences as long as the level, and lead to improved bounds for various multilinear forms of Kloosterman sums.
  As an application, we show that the greatest prime factor of $n^2+1$ is infinitely often greater than $n^{1.3}$, improving Merikoski's previous threshold of $n^{1.279}$. We also announce applications to the exponents of distribution of primes and smooth numbers in arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Badly approximable triangles and Delone sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the linear equation $x+y+z=1$ where $\pi x$, $\pi y$, $\pi z$ are three angles of a triangle and the numbers $x$, $y$, $z$ are badly approximable. We show that there are exactly two solutions which have the smallest partial quotients by lexicographical ordering. Lastly, we give a construction of associated Delone sets which are expected to have rotationally invariant diffraction.</description>

      <title>Algebraically trivial automorphisms of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the lattice-theoretic approach of Brandhorst--Cattaneo to classify algebraically trivial actions on the known IHS manifolds, up to deformation and birational conjugacy. In particular, we classify even order algebraically trivial nonsymplectic automorphisms, with or without trivial discriminant action. In the case of nontrivial discriminant actions, we show that such automorphisms exist only for finitely many known deformation types and orders.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for a problem of Littlewood on the zeros of cosine polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Z(N)$ denote the minimum number of zeros in $[0,2\pi]$ that a cosine polynomial of the form $$f_A(t)=\sum_{n\in A}\cos nt$$ can have when $A$ is a finite set of non-negative integers of size $|A|=N$. It is an old problem of Littlewood to determine $Z(N)$. In this paper, we obtain the lower bound $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log N)^{(1+o(1))}$ which exponentially improves on the previous best bounds of the form $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log\log N)^c$ due to Erd\'elyi and Sahasrabudhe.</description>

      <title>Graham's rearrangement conjecture beyond the rectification barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 1971 conjecture of Graham (later repeated by Erd\H{o}s and Graham) asserts that every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p \setminus \{0\}$ has an ordering whose partial sums are all distinct. We prove this conjecture for sets of size $|A| \leqslant e^{(\log p)^{1/4}}$; our result improves the previous bound of $\log p/\log \log p$. One ingredient in our argument is a structure theorem involving dissociated sets, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On hook length biases in $t$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $t\geq2$ and $k\geq1$ be integers. A $t$-regular partition of a positive integer $n$ is a partition of $n$ such that none of its parts is divisible by $t$. Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$. Recently, the first and the third authors proved that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$ for all $n\geq 4$, and conjectured that $b_{t+1,2}(n)\geq b_{t,2}(n)$ for all $t\geq 3$ and $n\geq 0$. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true for $t=3$.</description>

      <title>Tropical intersection homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical equivalence of algebraic cycles is defined abstractly by intersection numbers. Classically, for smooth complex proper toric varieties, the quotients by numerical equivalence with rational coefficients can be expressed geometrically as singular cohomology. In this paper, we generalize it to suitable pairs of smooth proper varieties and simple normal crossing divisors by introducing a tropical analog of Goresky-MacPherson's intersection homology.</description>
