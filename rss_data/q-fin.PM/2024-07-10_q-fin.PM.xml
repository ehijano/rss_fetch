      <title>Asymptotic methods for transaction costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general approximation method for determining optimal trading strategies in markets with proportional transaction costs, with a polynomial approximation of the residual value function. The method is exemplified by several problems from optimally tracking benchmarks, hedging the Log contract, to maximizing utility from terminal wealth. Strategies are also approximated by practically executable, discrete trades. We identify the necessary trade-off between trading frequency and trade sizes to have satisfactory agreement with the theoretically optimal, continuous strategies of infinite activity.</description>

      <title>Downside Risk Reduction Using Regime-Switching Signals: A Statistical Jump Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates a regime-switching investment strategy aimed at mitigating downside risk by reducing market exposure during anticipated unfavorable market regimes. We highlight the statistical jump model (JM) for market regime identification, a recently developed robust model that distinguishes itself from traditional Markov-switching models by enhancing regime persistence through a jump penalty applied at each state transition. Our JM utilizes a feature set comprising risk and return measures derived solely from the return series, with the optimal jump penalty selected through a time-series cross-validation method that directly optimizes strategy performance. Our empirical analysis evaluates the realistic out-of-sample performance of various strategies on major equity indices from the US, Germany, and Japan from 1990 to 2023, in the presence of transaction costs and trading delays. The results demonstrate the consistent outperformance of the JM-guided strategy in reducing risk metrics such as volatility and maximum drawdown, and enhancing risk-adjusted returns like the Sharpe ratio, when compared to both hidden Markov model-guided strategy and the buy-and-hold strategy. These findings underline the enhanced persistence, practicality, and versatility of strategies utilizing JMs for regime-switching signals.</description>
