      <title>A Subexponential Reduction from Product Partition to Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Product Partition Problem (PPP), i.e. we are given a set of $n$ natural numbers represented on $m$ bits each and we are asked if a subset exists such that the product of the numbers in the subset equals the product of the numbers not in the subset. Our approach is to obtain the integer factorization of each number. This is the subexponential step. We then form a matrix with the exponents of the primes and show that the PPP has a solution iff some Subset Sum Problems have a common solution. Finally, using the fact that the exponents are not large we combine all the Subset Sum Problems in a single Subset Sum Problem (SSP) and show that its size is polynomial in $m,n$. We show that the PPP has a solution iff the final SSP has one.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Unobservable MDPs: Decidability of Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unobservable Markov decision processes (UMDPs) serve as a prominent mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems. A key aspect in computational analysis is the consideration of decidability, which concerns the existence of algorithms. In general, the computation of the exact and approximated values is undecidable for UMDPs with the long-run average objective. Building on matrix product theory and ergodic properties, we introduce a novel subclass of UMDPs, termed ergodic UMDPs. Our main result demonstrates that approximating the value within this subclass is decidable. However, we show that the exact problem remains undecidable. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges of extending these results to partially observable Markov decision processes.</description>

      <title>Baby PIH: Parameterized Inapproximability of Min CSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis (PIH) is the analog of the PCP theorem in the world of parameterized complexity. It asserts that no FPT algorithm can distinguish a satisfiable 2CSP instance from one which is only $(1-\varepsilon)$-satisfiable (where the parameter is the number of variables) for some constant $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$.
  We consider a minimization version of CSPs (Min-CSP), where one may assign $r$ values to each variable, and the goal is to ensure that every constraint is satisfied by some choice among the $r \times r$ pairs of values assigned to its variables (call such a CSP instance $r$-list-satisfiable). We prove the following strong parameterized inapproximability for Min CSP: For every $r \ge 1$, it is W[1]-hard to tell if a 2CSP instance is satisfiable or is not even $r$-list-satisfiable. We refer to this statement as "Baby PIH", following the recently proved Baby PCP Theorem (Barto and Kozik, 2021). Our proof adapts the combinatorial arguments underlying the Baby PCP theorem, overcoming some basic obstacles that arise in the parameterized setting. Furthermore, our reduction runs in time polynomially bounded in both the number of variables and the alphabet size, and thus implies the Baby PCP theorem as well.</description>

      <title>Two Choices are Enough for P-LCPs, USOs, and Colorful Tangents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide polynomial-time reductions between three search problems from three distinct areas: the P-matrix linear complementarity problem (P-LCP), finding the sink of a unique sink orientation (USO), and a variant of the $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich problem. For all three settings, we show that "two choices are enough", meaning that the general non-binary version of the problem can be reduced in polynomial time to the binary version. This specifically means that generalized P-LCPs are equivalent to P-LCPs, and grid USOs are equivalent to cube USOs. These results are obtained by showing that both the P-LCP and our $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich variant are equivalent to a new problem we introduce, P-Lin-Bellman. This problem can be seen as a new tool for formulating problems as P-LCPs.</description>

      <title>Computational Lower Bounds for Graphon Estimation via Low-degree Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network analysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the statistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been established by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model and nonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based on constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in the dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known polynomial-time estimator is based universal singular value thresholding, but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the minimax one. The computational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational barrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this work, we provide rigorous evidence for the computational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials. Specifically, in SBM graphon estimation, we show that for low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be significantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter regimes and in nonparametric graphon estimation, we show low-degree polynomial estimators achieve estimation error rates strictly slower than the minimax rate. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree polynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges in applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our main results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering error for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and this yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold for efficient community recovery. Finally, we extend our computational lower bounds to sparse graphon estimation and biclustering.</description>

      <title>A criterion for Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17219v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem states that for $\ell\ge 2$, every $n$-vertex $K_{\ell+1}$-free graph with minimum degree greater than $\frac{3\ell-4}{3\ell-1}n$ must be $\ell$-partite. We establish a simple criterion for $r$-graphs, $r \geq 2$, to exhibit an Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type property, also known as degree-stability. This leads to a classification of most previously studied hypergraph families with this property. An immediate application of this result, combined with a general theorem by Keevash--Lenz--Mubayi, solves the spectral Tur\'{a}n problems for a large class of hypergraphs.
  For every $r$-graph $F$ with degree-stability, there is a simple algorithm to decide the $F$-freeness of an $n$-vertex $r$-graph with minimum degree greater than $(\pi(F) - \varepsilon_F)\binom{n}{r-1}$ in time $O(n^r)$, where $\varepsilon_F &gt;0$ is a constant. In particular, for the complete graph $K_{\ell+1}$, we can take $\varepsilon_{K_{\ell+1}} = (3\ell^2-\ell)^{-1}$, and this bound is tight up to some multiplicative constant factor unless $\mathbf{W[1]} = \mathbf{FPT}$. Based on a result by Chen--Huang--Kanj--Xia, we further show that for every fixed $C &gt; 0$, this problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(\ell)}$ if we replace $\varepsilon_{K_{\ell+1}}$ with $(C\ell)^{-1}$ unless $\mathbf{ETH}$ fails. Furthermore, we apply the degree-stability of $K_{\ell+1}$ to decide the $K_{\ell+1}$-freeness of graphs whose size is close to the Tur\'{a}n bound in time $(\ell+1)n^2$, partially improving a recent result by Fomin--Golovach--Sagunov--Simonov. As an intermediate step, we show that for a specific class of $r$-graphs $F$, the (surjective) $F$-coloring problem can be solved in time $O(n^r)$, provided the input $r$-graph has $n$ vertices and a large minimum degree, refining several previous results.</description>

      <title>Inner-approximate Reachability Computation via Zonotopic Boundary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inner-approximate reachability analysis involves calculating subsets of reachable sets, known as inner-approximations. This analysis is crucial in the fields of dynamic systems analysis and control theory as it provides a reliable estimation of the set of states that a system can reach from given initial states at a specific time instant. In this paper, we study the inner-approximate reachability analysis problem based on the set-boundary reachability method for systems modelled by ordinary differential equations, in which the computed inner-approximations are represented with zonotopes. The set-boundary reachability method computes an inner-approximation by excluding states reached from the initial set's boundary. The effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the efficient extraction of the exact boundary of the initial set. To address this, we propose methods leveraging boundary and tiling matrices that can efficiently extract and refine the exact boundary of the initial set represented by zonotopes. Additionally, we enhance the exclusion strategy by contracting the outer-approximations in a flexible way, which allows for the computation of less conservative inner-approximations. To evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with state-of-the-art methods against a series of benchmarks. The numerical results demonstrate that our method is not only efficient but also accurate in computing inner-approximations.</description>
