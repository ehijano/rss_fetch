      <title>Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium with TNG-Cluster: properties, morphology, and tangential anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.</description>

      <title>The effect of the environment-dependent stellar initial mass function on the baryonic Tully Fisher relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of an environment-dependent galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function (gwIMF) on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). The integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory, which incorporates variations in stellar populations due to star formation history (SFH) and metallicity, provides a more accurate framework for understanding systematic deviations in galaxy scaling relations than that given by an invariant gwIMF. By considering how the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population is influenced by metallicity and SFH, we show that high-mass galaxies have their masses in stars and remnants underestimated under the assumption of a constant mass-to-light ratio. In contrast, low-mass, gas-dominated galaxies are less affected. Our results suggest that the discrepancies between the true and observed BTFR are primarily driven by the evolving nature of the stellar IMF, particularly in galaxies with slowly declining SFHs. The IGIMF theory offers a solution to the observed offsets in the BTFR, especially for high-mass galaxies, where the rotational velocities are higher than predicted by MOND. We conclude that incorporating the IGIMF provides a more accurate description of galaxy dynamics, revealing the importance of stellar population characteristics in refining our understanding of the baryonic mass-velocity relationship. This study underscores the necessity of accounting for the variation of the gwIMF when interpreting the BTFR, particularly in the context of alternative gravitational theories like MOND.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Magnetic Fields on Second-Generation Star Formation in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored role of magnetic fields in the formation of second-generation (SG) stars in proto-globular clusters (GCs) using 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamical simulations. This study is based on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario and incorporates photoionization feedback and stellar winds from AGB stars. We model SG formation within a young ($34$ Myr) massive ($10^6 $ Msun) proto-GC moving through a magnetized, homogeneous interstellar medium. Our results indicate that variations in magnetic field strength and orientation significantly influence the gas geometry and SG star-forming regions around the cluster. Overall, magnetic fields limit SG formation to the very center of the cluster, with stronger magnetic fields tending to form more compact SG clusters. For magnetic field strengths of $0.5$ and $5$ microG, we observe no substantial changes in the mass of formed SG stars. However, with a strong $50$ microG field, we see a $25$ percent increase or a $70$ percent decrease in total SG mass, for a field aligned parallel or perpendicular to the cluster's motion, respectively. This variation reflects how magnetic fields influence gas accretion, as our results suggest that gas accreted from the interstellar medium (ISM) slightly dominates over AGB ejecta in the cluster, except in cases of strong perpendicular fields, where gas accretion is efficiently suppressed. Additionally, stronger magnetic fields limit the cluster's ability to retain its ejecta, leading to the formation of stars with lower helium abundances. On the other hand, a strong perpendicular magnetic field produces SG stars that originate from AGB ejecta and exhibit the highest helium abundances.</description>

      <title>Are the ONC, Pleiades, and Hyades snapshots of the same embedded cluster?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using direct $N$-body simulations, we investigate the initial conditions and evolution of a star-forming region resembling the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) with the advanced \textsc{NBODY6} code. By varying the initial conditions, we aim to identify a model that closely aligns with observed parameters such as the half-mass radius, core radius, and total mass. Additionally, we examine the cluster's evolution over 800 Myr to determine whether it could reproduce the present-day properties of the Pleiades and Hyades along its evolutionary path. Under the influence of a Milky Way-like tidal field, the ONC experiences significant mass loss, primarily due to rapid gas expulsion, retaining approximately 47\% of its initial 4200 stars by about 100 Myr and only 9\% by about 700 Myr. These evolutionary stages closely match the properties of the Pleiades and Hyades, suggesting that an ONC-like cluster may have been their precursor. Additional models with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation indicate that the ONC likely had an initial half-mass radius of 0.2-0.3 pc, a total mass of 1200 - 2000 M$_\odot$, and a high degree of mass segregation. Models with an initial stellar count of about $N_{\text{in}} \approx 4 \times 10^3 - 5 \times 10^3$, rich in binaries and exhibiting mass segregation, show excellent agreement with observed cluster properties.</description>

      <title>BASS LIII: The Eddington Ratio as the Primary Regulator of the Fraction of X-ray Emission in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emit radiation via accretion across the entire energy spectrum. While the standard disk and corona model can somewhat describe this emission, it fails to predict specific features such as the soft X-ray excess, the short-term optical/UV variability, and the observed UV/X-ray correlation in AGN. In this context, the fraction of AGN emission in different bands (i.e., bolometric corrections) can be useful to better understand the accretion physics of AGN. Past studies have shown that the X-ray bolometric corrections are strongly dependent on the physical properties of AGN, such as their luminosities and Eddington ratios. However, since these two parameters depend on each other, it has been unclear which is the main driver of the X-ray bolometric corrections. We present here results from a large study of hard X-ray-selected (14-195 keV) nearby ($z&lt;0.1$) AGN. Based on our systematic analysis of the simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions of 236 unobscured AGN, we found that the primary parameter controlling the X-ray bolometric corrections is the Eddington ratio. Our results show that while the X-ray bolometric correction increases with the bolometric luminosity for sources with intermediate Eddington ratios ($0.01-1$), this dependence vanishes for sources with lower Eddington ratios ($&lt;0.01$). This could be used as evidence for a change in the accretion physics of AGN at low Eddington ratios.</description>

      <title>The halo magnetic field of a spiral galaxy at z=0.414</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though magnetic fields play an important role in galaxy evolution, the redshift evolution of galactic-scale magnetic fields is not well constrained observationally. In this paper we aim to provide an observational constraint on the time-scale of the mean-field dynamo, and derive the magnetic field in a distant galaxy at $z=0.414$. We obtained broadband spectro-polarimetric $1-8$ GHz Very Large Array observation of the lensing system B1600+434, which is a background quasar gravitationally lensed by a foreground spiral galaxy into two images. We apply Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis and Stokes $QU$ fitting to derive the RM of the two lensed images, which we use to estimate the lensing galaxy's magnetic field. We measured the RM difference between the lensed images, and detected Faraday dispersion caused by the magneto-ionic medium of the lensing galaxy at $z=0.414$. Assuming that the RM difference is due to the large-scale regular field of the galaxy's halo, we measure a coherent magnetic field with a strength of $0.2 - 3.0\,\mu$G at 0.7 kpc, and $0.01 - 2.8 \,\mu$G at 6.2 kpc vertical distance from the disk of the galaxy. We derive an upper limit on the dynamo e-folding time: $\tau_{\rm dynamo} &lt; 2.9~\times 10^8$~yr. We find turbulence on scales below 50 pc, and a turbulent field strength of $0.2 - 12.1 \, \mu$G. We measure the magnetic field in the halo of a spiral galaxy, and find turbulence on scales of $&lt;50$ pc. If the RM difference is due to large-scale fields, our result follows the expectation from mean-field dynamo theory, and shows that galaxies at $z \simeq 0.4$ already have magnetic field strengths similar to present-day galaxies. However, we note the caveat of the possibility of the turbulent field of the lensing galaxy contributing to the observed RM difference.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Stars Match the Spectral Signatures of JWST's Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic, compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology, strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple, self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its ultimate collapse.</description>

      <title>Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.</description>

      <title>More than 60% of double-peaked narrow emission lines not related to dual galaxy systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual galaxy system (DGS) is one of the widely accepted scenarios to explain the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) due to orbital motions of the two galaxies in a merging system. After considering no physical connections between two independent narrow emission line regions in two galaxies in one DGS, there should be no correlations between flux ratios $R_{R}$ of red-shifted narrow emission components from one galaxy and flux ratios $R_{B}$ of blue-shifted narrow emission components from the other galaxy in the DGS. However, after checking the large sample of DPNELs in the SDSS, there are strong linear correlations in different groups between $R_{R}$ as the flux ratio of red-shifted narrow [O~{\sc iii}] to the red-shifted narrow H$\alpha$ and $R_{B}$ as the flux ratio of blue-shifted narrow [O~{\sc iii}] to the blue-shifted narrow H$\alpha$. Meanwhile, after checking narrow emission line properties of galaxy pairs within 30 (20, 10) arcmins, there are no connections between narrow emission line fluxes in the galaxy pairs, to support the detected linear correlations being robust enough between $R_{R}$ and $R_{B}$ in the DPNELs in SDSS. Furthermore, through oversimplified simulations, at least more than 60% of the DPNELs should be not related to the expected DGSs.</description>

      <title>Fine-structure Line Atlas for Multi-wavelength Extragalactic Study (FLAMES) III: [C II] as Tracer, Crisis of SFR, [O III]/[C II] at High-z, New Answers and New Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the final paper of this series, we discuss new perspectives and challenges in the study of interstellar medium (ISM), leveraging comprehensive catalogs and physical insights presented in our previous papers. We focus on key questions of far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs): their origins, diagnostic value, and implications of correlations. Our analysis reveals a strong dependence on elemental abundance, so that FSL/H$\alpha$ traces metallicity, [N II]/[C II] traces N/O, and $\sim$80% of [C II] emission arises from neutral gas without systematic variations. We conclude a coherence exists between the emissions from ionized and neutral gases regarding energy sources and distribution. We argue that [C II] is physically a metallicity-dependent star formation rate (SFR) tracer, while its correlations with atomic or molecular gas masses are secondary. Crucially, the [C II] ``deficit'' is only part of a universal ``deficit'' problem that shows in all neutral and ionized gas lines including extinction-corrected H$\alpha$, caused by infrared (IR) luminosities and characterized by a dichotomy in gas and dust behaviors. This universal ``deficit'' marks a breakdown of the obscuration-corrected star-formation rate (SFR) calibration and imperils SFR estimates. We argue that it is caused by either IR ``excess'' or ionized gas ``deficit'', and present possible scenarios. A renewed picture of ISM structure is needed to reconcile with ionized--neutral gas coherence, metallicity dependence, and gas--dust dichotomy. We also discuss differences of FIR FSL at high redshifts: the offset in ``deficit'' trends, the similar [O III]/[C II] in metal-poor galaxies, and elevated [O III]/[C II] in dusty galaxies.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Turbulence in Primordial Halos: A Comparison With and Without The Stream Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence plays a critical role in regulating star formation in molecular clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M \lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation and the resulting star formation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic star formation activity of galaxies within the first billion years probed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST highlighted an excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10, with a derived UVLF that exhibits a softer evolution than expected. In this work, we aim at characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum densities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce the SEDs of z&gt;6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies' physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each 6&lt;z&lt;12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log Mstar/Msun&gt; 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to 0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only &lt;20% of low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of galaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to 0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9. We include additional constraints from observations on sigmaUV and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and 0.06+/-0.01, for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z&gt;10. Our results add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely responsible for the high-z UVLF.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Feedback-Regulated Star Formation Activities around the Expanding Galactic MIR Bubble [HKS2019] E71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble [HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images (250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc, distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of 12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO) located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.</description>

      <title>Where is the Supervirial Gas? III. Insights from X-ray Shadow Observations and a revised Model for the Soft Diffuse X-ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow observations provide a powerful tool to separate foreground components of the soft diffuse X-ray background (SDXB) from the background components. Such observations have now established that the ``local'' foreground is made of the solar wind charge exchange and the local bubble, and the background emission is from the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and from the unresolved extragalactic sources. New data and careful analyses of the SDXB led to two new discoveries in recent years: (1) excess emission near 0.5 keV that is identified as the NVII emission line, and (2) excess emission near 0.8-1.0 keV that is identified with an additional, super-virial temperature hot thermal component of the CGM. The goal of this paper is to use Suzaku shadow observations along six sightlines to determine whether either of these components is from the ``local'' sources. We eliminate the ambiguity regarding the origin of NVII emission, ruling out the local origin. We confirm that the Milky Way CGM contains nitrogen-rich plasma, with a super-solar average (N/O) of 2.6+-0.5, and suggest that nitrogen-enhanced plasma is widespread throughout the CGM. We find super-solar Ne abundance in two sighlines, also from the CGM. Similarly, we rule out the local origin of the hot thermal component and confirm that it is present beyond the shadowing clouds. Furthermore, we provide a revised model of the soft diffuse X-ray background, which is crucial for extragalactic astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Star Formation History and Evolution of the Ultra-Diffuse M81 Satellite, F8D1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep HST imaging of one of the nearest ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) outside of the Local Group: F8D1, a satellite of M81 known to be tidally disrupting. UDGs are an enigmatic and diverse population, with evolutionary pathways ranging from tidal processing to bursty feedback and high initial angular momentum. To determine F8D1's evolutionary drivers, we resolve stars in F8D1's central $\sim$1 kpc and in a parallel field $\sim$6 kpc along its major axis to deep photometric limits, reaching below the Red Clump. We also image eight shallower fields along F8D1's major and minor axes. We calculate the star formation history (SFH) in the two deep fields, finding that while currently quiescent, both regions experienced a substantial burst $\sim$2 Gyr ago and a smaller burst $\sim$500 Myr ago, which likely formed F8D1's nuclear star cluster. In the shallow fields, using the ratio of evolved Asymptotic Giant Branch and Red Giant Branch stars out to $\sim$13 kpc along F8D1's known stellar stream, we confirm that F8D1 was globally star-forming until at least 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total progenitor stellar mass, including the stream, of $\sim$1.3$\times$10$^8\ M_{\odot}$, with an average [M/H] $\sim$ $-$0.8. We compare F8D1's properties to those of Local Group galaxies with similar initial stellar mass. We find that F8D1 is consistent with a progenitor star-forming galaxy similar to NGC 6822, which is in the midst of a transition to a Sagittarius-like system. Notably, this evolutionary sequence can be accomplished through tidal processing alone, in galaxies that have experienced sufficiently bursty feedback to create cored profiles.</description>

      <title>ColdPress: Efficient Quantile-Based Compression of Photometric Redshift PDFs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ColdPress is a Python module that compresses photometric redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs) by encoding quantiles of their cumulative distribution. For a fixed packet size (the default is 80 bytes per PDF), ColdPress attains a reconstruction accuracy comparable to the sparse-basis representation method implemented in the pdf_storage module of Carrasco-Kind &amp; Brunner (2014), yet reduces the computational cost by a factor of ~7000. I describe the implementation and quantify its compression speed and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to pdf_storage for real-life PDFs from two different photometric redshift codes. ColdPress is free software, available at https://github.com/ahc-photoz/coldpress-project.</description>

      <title>MUSEing on the host galaxies of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z&lt;0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z&lt;0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and &gt;45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Search for Dormant Black Holes in Low-Metallicity Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the massive black hole (BH) system Gaia BH3 in pre-release Gaia DR4 data suggests that wide BH binaries with luminous companions may be significantly overrepresented at low metallicities. Motivated by this finding, we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of low-metallicity stars exhibiting elevated RUWE values in Gaia DR3, using the FEROS and APF spectrographs. We identify promising BH binary candidates as objects with instantaneously measured radial velocities (RVs) that are very different from their mean RVs reported in Gaia DR3. Thus far, we have observed over 500 targets, including a nearly complete sample of stars with $\text{[Fe/H]} &lt; -1.5$, RUWE $&gt; 2$, and $G &lt; 15$. Our search has yielded one promising target exhibiting slow acceleration and an RV more than 98 km s$^{-1}$ different from its DR3 mean RV, as well as dozens of other candidates with smaller RV discrepancies. We quantify the sensitivity of our search using simulations, demonstrating that it recovers at least half of the BH companions within our selection criteria. We make all the spectra and RVs from our survey publicly available and encourage further follow-up.</description>

      <title>An All-sky Survey of White Dwarf Merger Remnants: Far-UV is the Key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of merging white dwarfs leave behind a white dwarf remnant. Hot/warm DQ white dwarfs with carbon-rich atmospheres have high masses and unusual kinematics. All evidence points to a merger origin. Here, we demonstrate that far-UV + optical photometry provides an efficient way to identify these merger remnants. We take advantage of this photometric selection to identify 167 candidates in the GALEX All-Sky Imaging Survey footprint, and provide follow-up spectroscopy. Out of the 140 with spectral classifications, we identify 75 warm DQ white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}&gt;10,000$ K, nearly tripling the number of such objects known. Our sample includes 13 DAQ white dwarfs with spectra dominated by hydrogen and (weaker) carbon lines. Ten of these are new discoveries, including the hottest DAQ known to date with $T_{\rm eff}\approx23,000$ K and $M=1.31~M_{\odot}$. We provide a model atmosphere analysis of all warm DQ white dwarfs found, and present their temperature and mass distributions. The sample mean and standard deviation are $T_{\rm eff} = 14,560 \pm 1970$ K and $M=1.11 \pm 0.09~M_{\odot}$. Warm DQs are roughly twice as massive as the classical DQs found at cooler temperatures. All warm DQs are found on or near the crystallization sequence. Even though their estimated cooling ages are of order 1 Gyr, their kinematics indicate an origin in the thick disk or halo. Hence, they are likely stuck on the crystallization sequence for $\sim$10 Gyr due to significant cooling delays from distillation of neutron-rich impurities. Future all-sky far-UV surveys like UVEX have the potential to significantly expand this sample.</description>

      <title>Chaos of charged particles in quadrupole magnetic fields under Schwarzschild backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A four-vector potential of an external test electromagnetic field in a Schwarzschild background is described in terms of a combination of dipole and quadrupole magnetic fields. This combination is an interior solution of the source-free Maxwell equations. Such external test magnetic fields cause the dynamics of charged particles around the black hole to be nonintegrable, and are mainly responsible for chaotic dynamics of charged particles. In addition to the external magnetic fields, some circumstances should be required for the onset of chaos. The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly through an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator. The inclusion of the quadrupole magnetic fields easily induces chaos, compared with that of the dipole magnetic fields. This result is because the Lorentz forces from the quadrupole magnetic fields are larger than those from the dipole magnetic fields. In addition, the Lorentz forces act as attractive forces, which are helpful to bring the occurrence of chaos in the nonintegrable case.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum consistent with that of a D-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope of 14.6%/1000 A in the 5000-9000 A range, which is similar to the one of Oumuamua but redder than that of 2I/Borisov and most solar system comets. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.25, -19.466, 18.94) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Hadronic acceleration in the young star cluster NGC 6611 inside the M16 region unveiled by Fermi-LAT: constraints on the acceleration efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially important sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray emitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution of this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the typical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for emission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We perform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a star-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind termination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive the energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We find significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated to the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic emission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination shock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the cloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration efficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\sim$ 1 % and $\sim$ 4 %.</description>

      <title>ALMA discovery of Punctum -- a highly polarized mm source in nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 4945</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a highly polarized millimeter (mm) continuum source in the central region of NGC 4945, identified through ALMA Band 3 observations. This starburst Seyfert 2 galaxy contains numerous compact mm sources, yet only one - located approximately 3.4" (~60 pc) from the galactic center and unresolved with ~0.1" resolution - exhibits an unusually high polarization degree of 50% $\pm$ 14%, likely originating from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The source is faint, yet clearly detected in two separate epochs of observation taken 14 days apart, with flux of 0.104 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.125 $\pm$ 0.016 mJy, as well as in earlier ALMA observations, showing no variability at any timescale. The spectral index remains stable within large uncertainties, -1.8 $\pm$ 2.5 and -1.3 $\pm$ 2.5. The source, which we further refer to as Punctum due to its compactness, revealed no clear counterparts in existing X-ray or radio observations. Assuming association with the central region of NGC 4945, we estimate upper limits for its luminosity of ~1 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 3-6 keV X-ray band (from archival Chandra data) and ~5 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 23 GHz (from archival ATCA data). A comparison of the radio, mm (including polarization), and X-ray properties with known astrophysical sources emitting synchrotron radiation, such as accreting neutron stars, supernova remnants, and non-thermal galactic filaments, revealed no clear match in any of these scenarios. The exact nature of this highly polarized source remains undetermined.</description>

      <title>(Exhaustive) Symbolic Regression and model selection by minimum description length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.</description>

      <title>A kinematic and structural study of young open clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy using Gaia DR3 catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1 kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc, covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters, stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant candidate \snr\ associated with the Calvera pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \sim 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti "Clump" region shows hared emission equally well described by a thermal (kT\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \sim 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded</description>

      <title>Minimum-entropy constraints on galactic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tracer sample in a gravitational potential, starting from a generic initial condition, phase-mixes towards a stationary state. This evolution is accompanied by an entropy increase, and the final state is characterized by a distribution function (DF) that depends only on integrals of motion (Jeans' theorem). We present a method to constrain a gravitational potential assuming a stationary (phase mixed) sample by minimizing the entropy the sample would have if it were allowed to phase-mix in trial potentials. This method avoids modeling the DF, and is applicable to any sets of integrals. We provide expressions for the entropy of DFs depending on energy, $f(E)$, energy and angular momentum, $f(E,L)$, or three actions, $f(\vec{J})$, and investigate the bias and statistical uncertainties in their estimates. We show that the method correctly recovers the parameters for spherical and axisymmetric potentials. We also present a methodology to characterize the posterior probability distribution of the parameters with an Approximate Bayesian Computation, indicating a pathway for application to observational data. Using $10^4$ tracers with $10\% (20\%)$-uncertainties in the 6D coordinates, we recover the flattening parameter $q$ of an axisymmetric potential with $\sigma_q/q\sim 5\% (10\%)$. The python module for the entropy estimators, \texttt{tropygal}, is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>SpecDis: Value added distance catalogue for 4 million stars from DESI Year-1 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the SpecDis value added stellar distance catalog accompanying DESI DR1. SpecDis trains a feed-forward Neural Network (NN) with Gaia parallaxes and gets the distance estimates. To build up unbiased training sample, we do not apply selections on parallax error or signal-to-noise (S/N) of the stellar spectra, and instead we incorporate parallax error into the loss function. Moreover, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the noise and dimensionality of stellar spectra. Validated by independent external samples of member stars with precise distances from globular clusters (GCs), dwarf galaxies, stellar streams, combined with blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars, we demonstrate that our distance measurements show no significant bias up to 100kpc, and are much more precise than Gaia parallax beyond 7kpc. The median distance uncertainties are 23%, 19%, 11% and 7% for S/N $&lt;$ 20, 20 $\leq$ S/N$&lt;$ 60, 60 $\leq$ S/N $&lt;$ 100 and S/N $\geq$ 100. Selecting stars with $\log g&lt;3.8$ and distance uncertainties smaller than 25%, we have more than 74,000 giant candidates within 50kpc to the Galactic center and 1,500 candidates beyond this distance. Additionally, we develop a Gaussian mixture model to identify unresolvable equal-mass binaries by modeling the discrepancy between the NN-predicted and the geometric absolute magnitudes from Gaia parallaxes and identify 120,000 equal-mass binary candidates. Our final catalog provides distances and distance uncertainties for $&gt;$ 4 million stars, offering a valuable resource for Galactic astronomy.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Incompleteness on Identifying and Interpreting Galaxy Protocluster Populations with the TNG-Cluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the TNG-Cluster simulation to investigate how stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) incompleteness affect the identification of density peaks within galaxy protoclusters at different redshifts. Our analysis focuses on a sample of $352$ protoclusters, defined as the progenitor populations of galaxies that reside within the virialized region of $z=0$ clusters with $M_{\rm{200}}^{z=0}\sim10^{14.3-15.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$. For comparison, we define our "baseline" protocluster population as galaxies with ${M}_{\star}&gt; 10^{8.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at any redshift. We find that ${M}_{\star}$-limited (${M}_{\star} &gt; 10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) and SFR-limited ($\rm{SFR} &gt; 10~{\rm M}_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) subpopulations recover the baseline highest galaxy density peak in roughly $\sim60\%$ of cases within an accuracy of $1.0$ pMpc (corresponding to an angular scale of $\sim 2-2.5$ arcmin) at $z &gt; 2$. This recovery fraction drops to $\sim40-50\%$ when restricting to galaxies with ${M}_{\star} &gt; 10^{10.0}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We find that the baseline highest galaxy density peaks typically coincide with the highest dark matter and stellar mass density peaks, with separations less than $0.5$ pMpc in $\sim60-75\%$ of cases at $z&gt;2$. This agreement drops to $\sim45-50\%$ when restricting to galaxies with ${M}_{\star} &gt; 10^{10.0}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$. These results indicate that identifying the densest regions of protoclusters -- i.e., the core -- is highly sensitive to stellar mass and SFR completeness limits. Nevertheless, at $z&gt;2$ we find that the baseline highest galaxy density peaks are generally sites of enhanced star formation and accelerated mass growth relative to the remainder of the protocluster, consistent with some observational studies.</description>

      <title>Disruptions of stars and binary systems on chaotic orbits in an axisymmetric Milky Way center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from 2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Torques from a Lopsided Young Stellar Component Sustain High Black Hole Accretion Rates in NGC 4593</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow primarily through gas accretion, observed as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While mergers can drive luminous AGN episodes, secular processes may fuel a substantial portion of cosmic BH growth. Whether these mechanisms can sustain high BH accretion rates remains uncertain. This study aims to identify the secular mechanism driving high BH accretion rates, by targeting a galaxy with moderately massive SMBH, high central gas densities, accretion rates of a few percent of the Eddington limit, and gas kinematics resolved close to black hole-dominated scales. A blind search led to the identification of NGC 4593, which is representative of the AGN population driving BH mass density growth since $z=1$. A prominent single-arm ("$m=1$") molecular gas spiral with ${\rm log}\,M_{\rm mol}/{\rm M}_\odot=8.1\pm0.3$ extends from 1.3$\,$kpc down to the SMBH's sphere of influence ($1.7^{+0.5}_{-0.2}\,{\rm pc}$). Star formation in the spiral is inefficient (${\rm SFR} = 4.9 \times 10^{-2} \,{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}$, $\langle t_{\rm dep}\rangle=3.9 \pm 0.6\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas inflow rate exceeds the SFR by two orders of magnitude and is sufficient to sustain the current BH accretion rate for $\geq$35$\,$Myr, enabling $\sim$10% SMBH growth. A young, lopsided stellar component (${\rm log}\,M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot=7.5-9.3$) exerts torques on the molecular gas, likely driving the gas inflow. This young stellar component may serve as both a cause and a product of sustained gas funnelling towards the SMBH. These findings provide evidence for the sustained secular $m=1$ feeding mode at high BH accretion rates, linking kpc-scale gas dynamics to the black hole's sphere of influence. This mechanism, consistent with simulation predictions, may represent a key contributor to SMBH growth in luminous AGNs since cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7} M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Soliton-Halo Relation in Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09908</link>

Abstract: Soliton cores at the center of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos provide a promising way to distinguish FDM from other dark matter models. However, the relation between solitons and their host halos remains contentious. Here, we rigorously examine this soliton-halo relation (SHR) using a rich set of cosmological simulations across various FDM particle masses, halo masses, and redshifts. We explicitly demonstrate thermal equilibrium between solitons and surrounding halo granules, energy equipartition within halos, and an FDM concentration-mass-nonisothermality relation. For each FDM halo, we confirm that its density profile outside the central soliton matches a collisionless N-body simulation from the same initial condition, serving as stringent numerical convergence tests. Our refined SHR agrees well with virialized halos in simulations, with a $1\sigma$ deviation of less than $30\%$. These findings not only reaffirm the SHR proposed by Schive et al. (2014) but also offer a more comprehensive understanding that extends its applicability. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer. A Python script for computing the theoretical SHR is available at https://github.com/calab-ntu/fdm-soliton-halo-relation.</description>

      <title>SIDDA: SInkhorn Dynamic Domain Adaptation for Image Classification with Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: discovery and physical description</title>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. \textbf{We obtained B,V, R, I, g, r, i, and z photometry with the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory 1.88-m telescope, the Palomar 200-inch telescope, and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope on 2025 July 2, 3, and 6. We measured colour indices B-V=0.98$\pm$0.23, V-R=0.71$\pm$0.09, R-I=0.14$\pm$0.10, g-r=0.84$\pm$0.05 mag, r-i=0.16$\pm$0.03 mag, i-z=-0.02$\pm$0.07 mag, and g-i=1.00$\pm$0.05 mag and a spectral slope of 16.0$\pm$1.9 $\%$/100 nm.} We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 184.6$\pm$4.6 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. 3I/ATLAS's coma has FWHM$\simeq$2.2 arcsec and A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$=280.8$\pm$3.2 cm. \textbf{We estimate that 3I/ATLAS's \textmu m-scale to mm-scale dust is ejected at $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying a dust production of $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.
  Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA.
  Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included.
  Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,</description>
