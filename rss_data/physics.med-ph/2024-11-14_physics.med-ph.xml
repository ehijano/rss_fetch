      <title>Current Progress of Digital Twin Construction Using Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging has played a pivotal role in advancing and refining digital twin technology, allowing for the development of highly personalized virtual models that represent human anatomy and physiological functions. A key component in constructing these digital twins is the integration of high-resolution imaging data, such as MRI, CT, PET, and ultrasound, with sophisticated computational models. Advances in medical imaging significantly enhance real-time simulation, predictive modeling, and early disease diagnosis, individualized treatment planning, ultimately boosting precision and personalized care. Although challenges persist, such as the complexity of anatomical modeling, integrating various imaging modalities, and high computational demands, recent progress in imaging and machine learning has greatly improved the precision and clinical applicability of digital twins. This review investigates the role of medical imaging in developing digital twins across organ systems. Key findings demonstrate that improvements in medical imaging have enhanced the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of digital twins beyond traditional methods, particularly in imaging accuracy, treatment effectiveness, and patient outcomes. The review also examines the technical barriers that currently limit further development of digital twin technology, despite advances in medical imaging, and outlines future research avenues aimed at overcoming these challenges to unlock the full potential of this technology in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Quantitative Angiography in Intracranial Aneurysm using Projection Foreshortening Correction and Injection Bias Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to mitigate these biases and enhance QA analysis by applying a path-length correction (PLC) correction, followed by singular value decomposition (SVD)-based deconvolution, to angiograms obtained through both in-silico and in-vitro methods. We utilized DSA data from in-silico and in-vitro patient-specific intracranial aneurysm models. To remove projection bias, PLC for various views were developed by co-registering the pre-existing 3D vascular geometry mask with the DSA projections, followed by ray tracing to determine paths across 3D vessel structures. These maps were used to normalize the logarithmic angiographic images, correcting for projection-induced foreshortening across different angles. Subsequently, we focused on eliminating injection bias by analyzing the corrected angiograms under varied projection views, injection rates, and flow conditions. Regions of interest at the aneurysm dome and inlet were placed to extract Time Density Curves for the lesion and the arterial input function, respectively. Using three standard SVD methodologies, we extracted the aneurysm Impulse Response function (IRF) and its associated parameters Peak Height (PHIRF), Area Under the Curve (AUCIRF), and Mean Transit Time (MTT). Our methodology employing PLC and SVD-based deconvolution ensures reliable quantitative angiographic measurements across varying conditions, supporting consistent assessments of disease severity and treatment efficacy. This approach significantly enhances intrapatient and intraprocedural reliability in neurovascular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Imaging of $^{55}\text{Co}$ and $^{18}\text{F}$-Labeled Tracers in a Single "Multiplexed" PET Imaging Session</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of Co-55 as a radioisotope for multiplexed PET (mPET) by utilizing its emission of a prompt gamma-ray in cascade with a positron during decay. We leverage the prompt-gamma signal to generate triple coincidences for a Co-55-labeled tracer, allowing us to distinguish it from a tracer labeled with a pure positron emitter, such as F-18. By employing triple versus double coincidence detection and signal processing methodology, we successfully separate the Co-55 signal from that of F-18. Phantom studies were conducted to establish the correlation between Co-55 double and triple coincidence counts and Co-55 activity. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for quantifying hot spots within a warm background produced by both Co-55 and F-18 signals in a single PET scan. Finally, we showcase the ability to simultaneously image two tracers in vivo in a single PET session with mouse models of cancer.</description>

      <title>A novel imaging setup for hybrid radiotherapy tailored PET/MR in patients with head and neck cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Radiotherapy commonly relies on CT, but there is growing interest in using hybrid PET/MR. Therefore, dedicated hardware setups have been proposed for PET/MR systems which enable imaging in radiotherapy treatment position. These radiotherapy setups typically include a flat tabletop, positioning tools and coil holders specifically tailored to the devices. However, reduced MR image quality has been reported. Especially in neck and upper thorax, conventional radiotherapy setups are not optimal as they consist of head-only coil configurations. The purpose was to develop a novel PET/MR radiotherapy setup for improved MR image quality in head, neck and thorax and to test compliance in a multicenter setting. Methods: A novel radiotherapy setup was designed, prototyped and tested on a 3T PET/MR system in three different centers. Imaging experiments were conducted in phantoms and healthy volunteers to compare against a standard radiotherapy setup. Imaging protocols included T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted MR (DWI). Finally, compliance with American College of Radiology (ACR) and the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) acceptance criteria was evaluated. Results: SNR in neck/thorax was increased by a factor of 1.6 in phantom (p = 0.031) and volunteer images alike. The new setup passed ACR detectability and QIBA SNR tests, which the standard setup failed. The new setup passed all but two ACR test criteria in the three centers, presented repeatability and reproducibility variations of 4.9% and 7.8% and met all QIBA criteria for DWI except ADC precision. Conclusion: The proposed setup yielded significantly higher SNR, better detectability, and complied with nearly all ACR and QIBA image quality criteria. It may thus advance the usage of PET/MR for radiotherapy purposes.</description>

      <title>A generalized software framework for consolidation of radiotherapy planning and delivery data from diverse data sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregating large-scale radiotherapy planning and delivery data is crucial for advancing radiation oncology research and improving clinical practice, yet challenges persist due to the diversity of treatment planning systems (TPS), record and verify (R&amp;V) systems, and complex data formats lacking standardized retrieval methods. We developed a robust software framework that automates the collection and integration of multi-institutional radiotherapy data from diverse TPS and R&amp;V systems. By utilizing the unidirectional references of DICOM objects, our framework reconstructs complete patient datasets starting from Radiotherapy Treatment Records (RTRECORDs), managing tasks such as data queries, transfers, verification, and logging. It effectively maps DICOM linkages between RTRECORDs, RTPLANs, RTDOSEs, RTSTRUCTs, planning images, registrations, and associated diagnostic images, incorporating custom modules for data conversion and comprehensive error handling. Implemented across multiple institutions using various systems$-$ including ARIA, Eclipse, MOSAIQ, RayStation, MIM, Pinnacle$-$ the framework successfully collected data from two clinics over an 11-year period, aggregating data from 6,022 patients and 13,871 treatment plans with a success rate of 99.76% and an average processing time of approximately 18 minutes per patient. Ongoing efforts are extending data collection to clinics lacking DICOM Query/Retrieve capabilities, demonstrating the framework's adaptability to various clinical environments. This efficient automation of comprehensive data collection overcomes significant technical barriers, facilitating the creation of large-scale datasets that can accelerate advancements in radiation oncology.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Signal Warping for Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) is a major cardiovascular risk factor, linked to heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death, often resulting from chronic stress like hypertension. Electrocardiography (ECG), while varying in sensitivity, is widely accessible and cost-effective for detecting LVH-related morphological changes. This work introduces a bilateral signal warping (BSW) approach to improve ECG-based LVH diagnosis. Our method creates a library of heartbeat prototypes from patients with consistent ECG patterns. After preprocessing to eliminate baseline wander and detect R peaks, we apply BSW to cluster heartbeats, generating prototypes for both normal and LVH classes. We compare each new record to these references to support diagnosis. Experimental results show promising potential for practical application in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>A Review of Electromagnetic Elimination Methods for low-field portable MRI scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes conventional and deep learning methods for eliminating electromagnetic interference (EMI) in MRI systems. We compare traditional analytical and adaptive techniques with advanced deep learning approaches. Key strengths and limitations of each method are highlighted. Recent advancements in active EMI elimination, such as external EMI receiver coils, are discussed alongside deep learning methods, which show superior EMI suppression by leveraging neural networks trained on MRI data. While deep learning improves EMI elimination and diagnostic capabilities, it introduces security and safety concerns, particularly in commercial applications. A balanced approach, integrating conventional reliability with deep learning's advanced capabilities, is proposed for more effective EMI suppression in MRI systems.</description>
