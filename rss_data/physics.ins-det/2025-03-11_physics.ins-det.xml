      <title>Time measurement of scintillator detector based on Belle II KLM upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upgrade proposal for the Belle II experiment focuses on improving the time resolution for the KLM detector. We investigated the feasibility of incorporating Time-of-Flight system for muon and KL detections within the Belle II KLM framework, which utilizes plastic scintillators and SiPM readouts. To achieve this, we developed high-speed front-end electronics and arrays optimized for SiPM detection. By implementing constant fraction timing and employing a weighted average of dual-end timing, we significantly enhanced the timing accuracy for particle detection. Comprehensive testing and analysis show that a plastic scintillator measuring 135 cm in length is capable of achieving a time resolution of (70\pm7) ps. Furthermore, a shorter 50 cm plastic scintillator can achieve a time resolution of (47\pm2) ps.</description>

      <title>Deuterium-deuterium fusion charged particle detection using CR-39 and Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors are widely used in fusion research for detecting charged particles produced in fusion reactions. However, analyzing increasingly complex and large-scale CR-39 track images to extract meaningful information can be a tedious and time-consuming process, often prone to human errors and bias. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-based classification model capable of differentiating protons, tritons, and helions produced during D-D fusion, using CR-39 track images as input data. The CR-39 track images were processed and used to train a deep learning model. By preprocessing the track images for noise reduction and feature enhancement, we trained the YOLOv8 [1][2] network to distinguish the three particle types with high accuracy. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of over 96%, demonstrating its potential for improving automated track analysis in CR-39 detectors. Additionally, the model precisely identifies particle coordinates and counts, enabling comprehensive particle analysis. This study highlights the application of AI in track detection and classification, offering a robust solution for particle identification in CR-39 detector-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Photonuclear treatment for spent fuel radiotoxicity reduction: a case study investigation on minor actinides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) is one of the main challenges in the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Thermal reactors, such as Light Water Reactors (LWRs), produce significant amounts of minor actinides (MAs) such as Americium, Curium, and Neptunium, which are key contributors to the long-term radiotoxicity and decay heat in SNF. Currently, the long term widely accepted solution is the geological disposal. At the same time, advanced technologies like Partitioning and Transmutation (P\&amp;T) offer promising solutions to reduce SNF long-term radiotoxicity. While most transmutation strategies rely on neutron fluxes, in this study the adoption of photon beam to induce photonuclear reactions in SNF is investigated, without depending on neutron based systems. In particular, the study focuses on the probability of inducing transmutations and fissions on MAs, by leveraging the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) region of photonuclear interactions. In the investigated case study, the effect of a photon driven transmutation of minor actinides present in a spent fuel from SMR technology was evaluated. This approach offers a novel solution to the challenges of nuclear waste management which may become an alternative path in treating the radiotoxicity of minor actinides with the adoption of high enough photon fluxes.</description>

      <title>First generation 4H-SiC LGAD production and its performance evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution will delve into the design and performance of the newly produced Silicon Carbide Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (4H-SiC LGADs) and provide a comprehensive summary of their measured characteristics. This includes an analysis of the detector's performance, temperature stability, and the effectiveness of the internal gain layer in improving signal generation.
  The 4H-SiC is re-emerging as a strong candidate for the next generation of semiconductor detectors. This material offers several advantages, including high radiation tolerance and the ability to operate over a wide range of temperatures without significant annealing effects. However, the signals generated by minimum ionizing particles in the 4H-SiC detector are lower compared to the signal produced by standard silicon detectors due to their higher bandgap energy. This is addressed by implementing a charge multiplication layer, which results in the intrinsic gain of the device.
  The presented 4H-SiC LGADs produced by onsemi are specifically designed and optimized for fabrication on the n-type substrate/epi wafer with the gain layer implanted approximately $1~\mathrm{\mu m}$ below the surface. The first iteration of these LGAD structures was manufactured in early 2024 and since then has been subjected to laboratory evaluation. The measured properties of these detectors align well with the predictions arising from the extensive TCAD simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Pink-Beam Dark Field X-ray Microscopy: Expanding 3D/4D Imaging for Complex and Deformed Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) has advanced 3D non-destructive, high-resolution imaging of strain and orientation in crystalline materials, enabling the study of embedded structures in bulk. However, the photon-intensive nature of monochromatic DFXM limits its applicability to highly deformed or weakly crystalline structures and constrains time-resolved studies in industrially relevant materials. We present pink-beam DFXM (\pDFXM) at the ID03 beamline of ESRF, achieving a 27-fold increase in diffracted intensity while maintaining 100 nm spatial resolution. We validate \pDFXM{} by imaging a partially recrystallized aluminum grain, confirming sufficient angular resolution for microstructure mapping. The increased flux significantly enhances the diffracted signal, enabling the resolution of subgrain structures. Additionally, we image a highly deformed ferritic iron grain, previously inaccessible in monochromatic mode without focusing optics. Beyond static imaging, \pDFXM{} enables real-time tracking of grain growth during annealing, achieving hundred-millisecond temporal resolution. By combining high photon flux with non-destructive, high-resolution 3D mapping, \pDFXM{} expands diffraction-contrast imaging to poorly diffracting crystals, unlocking new opportunities for studying grain growth, fatigue, and corrosion in bulk materials.</description>

      <title>APEX: Optimized vertical drift PDS for DUNE FD3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment currently under construction in the US will be a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment dedicated to determining the neutrino mass ordering and to measure the CP violation phase in the lepton sector. DUNE will also perform studies of non-beam physics such as atmospheric neutrinos, bursts from supernovae and nucleon decays in which photon detection systems will play a major role in triggering and also provide calorimetric measurements. For the second phase of DUNE, two additional detector modules will be added in the far detector complex in the Sanford Underground Research Facility. We present the Aluminum Profiles with Embedded X-ARAPUCA (APEX) concept as an advanced proposal for the photon detector system of the third DUNE far detector module. This system aims to have an optical coverage of approximately 60% made viable by the technology advancement achieved by the DUNE collaboration on the use of non-conductive optical fibers for power and signal readout of the photon detector units. Such large coverage will provide enhanced light collection capabilities at MeV-scale energy deposit level per interaction and optimal energy reconstruction resolution up to the GeV scale. The attained electrical isolation of the detector units with low noise levels allows for a complete instrumentation of the field cage walls with satisfactory segmentation as the readout scheme envisages a much larger than typical number of channels to be adopted. We discuss the main features of the system, first estimates on its expected performances, potential for physics measurements and prototyping plans for R\&amp;D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>

      <title>New CCD Driving Technique to Suppress Anomalous Charge Intrusion from Outside the Imaging Area for Soft X-ray Imager of Xtend onboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) is an X-ray CCD camera of the Xtend system onboard the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), which was successfully launched on September 7, 2023 (JST). During ground cooling tests of the CCDs in 2020/2021, using the flight-model detector housing, electronic boards, and a mechanical cooler, we encountered an unexpected issue. Anomalous charges appeared outside the imaging area of the CCDs and intruded into the imaging area, causing pulse heights to stick to the maximum value over a wide region. Although this issue has not occurred in subsequent tests or in orbit so far, it could seriously affect the imaging and spectroscopic performance of the SXI if it were to happen in the future. Through experiments with non-flight-model detector components, we successfully reproduced the issue and identified that the anomalous charges intrude via the potential structure created by the charge injection electrode at the top of the imaging area. To prevent anomalous charge intrusion and maintain imaging and spectroscopic performance that satisfies the requirements, even if this issue occurs in orbit, we developed a new CCD driving technique. This technique is different from the normal operation in terms of potential structure and its changes during imaging and charge injection. In this paper, we report an overview of the anomalous charge issue, the related potential structures, the development of the new CCD driving technique to prevent the issue, the imaging and spectroscopic performance of the new technique, and the results of experiments to investigate the cause of anomalous charges.</description>

      <title>Novel concept for low-energy antineutron production and its application for antineutron scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive data of antiproton scattering cross sections with protons and nuclei have advanced our understanding of hadronic interactions with antinucleons. However, low-energy antineutron scattering data are scarce, thereby limiting our understanding of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon and antinucleon-nucleus interactions. We present a novel production scheme of extremely low-energy antineutrons that could remedy this situation. This method is based on backward charge-exchange reaction ($p\bar{p}\to n\bar{n}$), and can reach the lowest momentum of 9 MeV/c, which would be well suited to study of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon or antinucleon-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Electron-ion recombination in composite interactions in liquid xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of liquid xenon to various types of ionizing radiation has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally. Recent progress in direct detection dark matter experiments highlights the significance of composite events, where multiple particles interact with xenon simultaneously and generate overlapping ionization signatures. In these events, recombination of electrons and ions associated with different primary particles leads to additional suppression of the ionization signal, introducing a new source of uncertainty in dark matter searches and Migdal effect studies. We developed a model to estimate the recombination enhancement for overlapping low-energy particle interactions. This method, which has minimal dependence on xenon microphysics and is primarily driven by existing experimental data, yields predictions that are consistent with available measurements of composite interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model predictions are robust against xenon microphysics assumptions.</description>

      <title>Precise synchronization of a free-running Rubidium atomic clock with GPS Time for applications in experimental particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of our study devoted to the development of a time correction algorithm needed to precisely synchronize a free-running Rubidium atomic clock with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This R&amp;D is performed in view of the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) experiment currently under construction in Japan, which requires a synchronization with UTC and between its different experimental sites with a precision better than $100$ ns. We use a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver to compare a PPS and a $10$ MHz signal, generated by a free-running Rubidium clock, to the Global Positioning System (GPS) Time signal. We use these comparisons to correct the time series (time stamps) provided by the Rubidium clock signal. We fit the difference between Rubidium and GPS Time with polynomial functions of time over a certain integration time window to extract a correction of the Rubidium time stamps in offline or online mode. In online mode, the latest fit results are used for the correction until a new comparison to GPS Time becomes available. We show that with an integration time window of around $10^4$ seconds, we can correct the time stamps drift, caused by the frequency random walk noise and the deterministic frequency drift of the free running Rubidium clock, so that the time difference with respect to GPS Time stays within a $\pm5$ ns range in both offline or online correction mode. Presented results could be of interest for other experiments in the field of neutrino physics and multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JUNO is a huge neutrino detector that will use 20 kton of organic liquid scintillator as its detection medium. The scintillator is a mixture of linear alkyl benzene (LAB), 2.5 g/L of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) and 3 mg/L of 1,4-Bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene (Bis-MSB). The main goal of JUNO is to determine the Neutrino Mass Ordering [1, 2, 3]. In order to achieve this purpose, good energy and position reconstruction is required, hence a complete understanding of the optical characteristics of the liquid scintillator is mandatory. In this paper we present the measurements on the JUNO scintillator emission spectrum, absorption length and fluorescence time distribution performed respectively with a spectrofluorimeter, a spectrophotometer and a custom made setup</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>

Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>

      <title>Low-energy neutron cross-talk between organic scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of measurements have been performed with low-energy monoenergetic neutrons to characterise cross-talk between two organic scintillator detectors. Cross-talk time-of-flight spectra and probabilities were determined for neutron energies from 1.4 to 15.5 MeV and effective scattering angles ranging from $\sim$50{\deg} to $\sim$100{\deg}. Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating both the active and inactive materials making up the detectors showed reasonable agreement with the measurements. Whilst the time-of-flight spectra were very well reproduced, the cross-talk probabilities were only in approximate agreement with the measurements, with the most significant discrepancies ($\sim$40 %) occurring at the lowest energies. The neutron interaction processes producing cross-talk at the energies explored here are discussed in the light of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detector concept, named IDEA, optimized for the physics and running conditions at the FCC-ee is presented. After discussing the expected running conditions and the main physics drivers, a detailed description of the individual sub-detectors is given. These include: a very light tracking system with a powerful vertex detector inside a large drift chamber surrounded by a silicon wrapper, a high resolution dual readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, an HTS based superconducting solenoid, a dual readout fiber calorimeter and three layers of muon chambers embedded in the magnet flux return yoke. Some examples of the expected detector performance, based on fast and full simulation, are also given.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Background from $^{13}$C$(\alpha, n)^{16}$O Reaction in the JUNO Scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale organic liquid scintillator detectors are highly efficient in the detection of MeV-scale electron antineutrinos. These signal events can be detected through inverse beta decay on protons, which produce a positron accompanied by a neutron. A noteworthy background for antineutrinos coming from nuclear power reactors and from the depths of the Earth (geoneutrinos) is generated by ($\alpha, n$) reactions. In organic liquid scintillator detectors, $\alpha$ particles emitted from intrinsic contaminants such as $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th, and $^{210}$Pb/$^{210}$Po, can be captured on $^{13}$C nuclei, followed by the emission of a MeV-scale neutron. Three distinct interaction mechanisms can produce prompt energy depositions preceding the delayed neutron capture, leading to a pair of events correlated in space and time within the detector. Thus, ($\alpha, n$) reactions represent an indistinguishable background in liquid scintillator-based antineutrino detectors, where their expected rate and energy spectrum are typically evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. This work presents results from the open-source SaG4n software, used to calculate the expected energy depositions from the neutron and any associated de-excitation products. Also simulated is a detailed detector response to these interactions, using a dedicated Geant4-based simulation software from the JUNO experiment. An expected measurable $^{13}$C$(\alpha, n)^{16}$O event rate and reconstructed prompt energy spectrum with associated uncertainties, are presented in the context of JUNO, however, the methods and results are applicable and relevant to other organic liquid scintillator neutrino detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology of low frequency electromagnetic modes with frequency upconverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the RF Quantum Upconverter (RQU) and describe its application to quantum metrology of electromagnetic modes between dc and the Very High Frequency band (VHF) ($\lesssim$300MHz). The RQU uses a Josephson interferometer made up of superconducting loops and Josephson junctions to implement a parametric interaction between a low-frequency electromagnetic mode (between dc and VHF) and a mode in the microwave C Band ($\sim$ 5GHz), analogous to the radiation pressure interaction between electromagnetic and mechanical modes in cavity optomechanics. We analyze RQU performance with quantum amplifier theory, and show that the RQU can operate as a quantum-limited op-amp in this frequency range. It can also use non-classical measurement protocols equivalent to those used in cavity optomechanics, including back-action evading (BAE) measurements, sideband cooling, and two-mode squeezing. These protocols enable experiments using dc--VHF electromagnetic modes as quantum sensors with sensitivity better than the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). We demonstrate signal upconversion from low frequencies to microwave C band using an RQU and show a phase-sensitive gain (extinction ratio) of $46.9$\;dB, which is a necessary step towards the realization of full BAE.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Infrared Bolometers Based on 40-nm-Thick Nano-Thermoelectric Silicon Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of the-art infrared photodetectors operating in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR) are largely dominated by cryogenically cooled quantum sensors when the target is the highest sensitivity and detection speeds. Nano-thermoelectrics provide a route towards competitive uncooled infrared bolometer technology that can obtain high speed and sensitivity, low-power operation, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers with fast and high-sensitivity response to LWIR around 10 $\mu$m. These devices are based on ultra-thin silicon membranes that utilize the dimensional scaling of silicon nanomembranes in thermoelectric elements and are combined with metallic nanomembranes with subwavelength absorber structures. The fast device performance stems from a low heat capacity design where the thermoelectric beams act both as mechanical supports and transducer elements. Furthermore, by scaling down the thickness of the thermoelectric beams the thermal conductivity is reduced owing to enhanced phonon boundary scattering, resulting in increased sensitivity. The nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers are based on 40-nm-thick n- and p-type silicon membranes with LWIR (voltage) responsivities up to 1636 V/W and 1350 V/W and time constants in the range of 300-600 $\mu$s, resulting in specific detectivities up to $1.56\times10^8$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W. We also investigate the use of a heavily doped N++ substrate to increase optical cavity back reflection, resulting in an increased Si substrate reflectance from 30% to 70%-75% for wavelengths between 8-10 $\mu$m, resulting in an increase in device responsivity by approximately 20%.</description>
