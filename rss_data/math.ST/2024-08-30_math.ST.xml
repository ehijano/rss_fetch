      <title>A Tutorial on Brownian Motion for Biostatisticians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript provides an in-depth exploration of Brownian Motion, a fundamental stochastic process in probability theory for Biostatisticians. It begins with foundational definitions and properties, including the construction of Brownian motion and its Markovian characteristics. The document delves into advanced topics such as the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, reflection principles, and Levy's modulus of continuity. Through rigorous proofs and theorems, the manuscript examines the non-differentiability of Brownian paths, the behavior of zero sets, and the significance of local time. The notes also cover important results like Donsker's theorem and Blumenthal's 0-1 law, emphasizing their implications in the study of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Inferring the parameters of Taylor's law in ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taylor's power law (TL) or fluctuation scaling has been verified empirically for the abundances of many species, human and non-human, and in many other fields including physics, meteorology, computer science, and finance. TL asserts that the variance is directly proportional to a power of the mean, exactly for population moments and, whether or not population moments exist, approximately for sample moments. In many papers, linear regression of log variance as a function of log mean is used to estimate TL's parameters. We provide some statistical guarantees with large-sample asymptotics for this kind of inference under general conditions, and we derive confidence intervals for the parameters. In many ecological applications, the means and variances are estimated over time or across space from arrays of abundance data collected at different locations and time points. When the ratio between the time-series length and the number of spatial points converges to a constant as both become large, the usual normalized statistics are asymptotically biased. We provide a bias correction to get correct confidence intervals. TL, widely studied in multiple sciences, is a source of challenging new statistical problems in a nonstationary spatiotemporal framework. We illustrate our results with both simulated and real data sets.</description>

      <title>A More Unified Theory of Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that some basic moduli of continuity $\delta$ -- which measure how fast target risk decreases as source risk decreases -- appear to be at the root of many of the classical relatedness measures in transfer learning and related literature. Namely, bounds in terms of $\delta$ recover many of the existing bounds in terms of other measures of relatedness -- both in regression and classification -- and can at times be tighter.
  We are particularly interested in general situations where the learner has access to both source data and some or no target data. The unified perspective allowed by the moduli $\delta$ allow us to extend many existing notions of relatedness at once to these scenarios involving target data: interestingly, while $\delta$ itself might not be efficiently estimated, adaptive procedures exist -- based on reductions to confidence sets -- which can get nearly tight rates in terms of $\delta$ with no prior distributional knowledge. Such adaptivity to unknown $\delta$ immediately implies adaptivity to many classical relatedness notions, in terms of combined source and target samples' sizes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data following an interval structure are increasingly prevalent in many scientific applications. In medicine, clinical events are often monitored between two clinical visits, making the exact time of the event unknown and generating outcomes with a range format. As interest in automating healthcare decisions grows, uncertainty quantification via predictive regions becomes essential for developing reliable and trusworthy predictive algorithms. However, the statistical literature currently lacks a general methodology for interval targets, especially when these outcomes are incomplete due to censoring. We propose a uncertainty quantification algorithm and establish its theoretical properties using empirical process arguments based on a newly developed class of functions specifically designed for interval data structures. Although this paper primarily focuses on deriving predictive regions for interval-censored data, the approach can also be applied to other statistical modeling tasks, such as goodness-of-fit assessments. Finally, the applicability of the methods developed here is illustrated through various biomedical applications, including two clinical examples: i) sleep time and its link with cardiovasculuar diseases ii) survival time and physical activity values.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric goodness of fit tests for Pareto type-I distribution with complete and censored data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two new goodness of fit tests for the Pareto type-I distribution for complete and right censored data are proposed using fixed point characterization based on Steins type identity. The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics under both the null and alternative hypotheses are obtained. The performance of the proposed tests is evaluated and compared with existing tests through a Monte Carlo simulation experiment. The newly proposed tests exhibit greater power than existing tests for the Pareto type-I distribution. Finally, the methodology is applied to real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>A Score-Based Density Formula, with Applications in Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have revolutionized the field of generative modeling, achieving unprecedented success in generating realistic and diverse content. Despite empirical advances, the theoretical basis for why optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the log-likelihood is effective for training diffusion generative models, such as DDPMs, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this question by establishing a density formula for a continuous-time diffusion process, which can be viewed as the continuous-time limit of the forward process in an SGM. This formula reveals the connection between the target density and the score function associated with each step of the forward process. Building on this, we demonstrate that the minimizer of the optimization objective for training DDPMs nearly coincides with that of the true objective, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing DDPMs using the ELBO. Furthermore, we offer new insights into the role of score-matching regularization in training GANs, the use of ELBO in diffusion classifiers, and the recently proposed diffusion loss.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for non-degenerate multivariate $U$-statistics with estimated nuisance parameters under the null and local alternative hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-sample behavior of non-degenerate multivariate $U$-statistics of arbitrary degree is investigated under the assumption that their kernel depends on parameters that can be estimated consistently. Mild regularity conditions are given which guarantee that once properly normalized, such statistics are asymptotically multivariate Gaussian both under the null hypothesis and sequences of local alternatives. The work of Randles (1982, \emph{Ann. Statist.}) is extended in three ways: the data and the kernel values can be multivariate rather than univariate, the limiting behavior under local alternatives is studied for the first time, and the effect of knowing some of the nuisance parameters is quantified. These results can be applied to a broad range of goodness-of-fit testing contexts, as shown in two specific examples.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of bivariate Conditional Transition Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent literature has found conditional transition rates to be a useful tool for avoiding Markov assumptions in multi-state models. While the estimation of univariate conditional transition rates has been extensively studied, the intertemporal dependencies captured in the bivariate conditional transition rates still require a consistent estimator. We provide an estimator that is suitable for censored data and emphasize the connection to the rich theory of the estimation of bivariate survival functions. Bivariate conditional transition rates are necessary for various applications in the survival context but especially in the calculation of moments in life insurance mathematics.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of high dimensional rescaled sample correlation matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional sample correlation matrices are a crucial class of random matrices in multivariate statistical analysis. The central limit theorem (CLT) provides a theoretical foundation for statistical inference. In this paper, assuming that the data dimension increases proportionally with the sample size, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of the matrix $\widehat{\mathbf{R}}_n\mathbf{M}$ and establish the CLTs for the linear spectral statistics (LSS) of $\widehat{\mathbf{R}}_n\mathbf{M}$ in two structures: linear independent component structure and elliptical structure. In contrast to existing literature, our proposed spectral properties do not require $\mathbf{M}$ to be an identity matrix. Moreover, we also derive the joint limiting distribution of LSSs of $\widehat{\mathbf{R}}_n \mathbf{M}_1,\ldots,\widehat{\mathbf{R}}_n \mathbf{M}_K$. As an illustration, an application is given for the CLT.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Feature Importance Methods for Scientific Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used due to their high predictive power, their use in understanding the data-generating process (DGP) is limited. Understanding the DGP requires insights into feature-target associations, which many ML models cannot directly provide due to their opaque internal mechanisms. Feature importance (FI) methods provide useful insights into the DGP under certain conditions. Since the results of different FI methods have different interpretations, selecting the correct FI method for a concrete use case is crucial and still requires expert knowledge. This paper serves as a comprehensive guide to help understand the different interpretations of global FI methods. Through an extensive review of FI methods and providing new proofs regarding their interpretation, we facilitate a thorough understanding of these methods and formulate concrete recommendations for scientific inference. We conclude by discussing options for FI uncertainty estimation and point to directions for future research aiming at full statistical inference from black-box ML models.</description>

      <title>A Kernel-Based Conditional Two-Sample Test Using Nearest Neighbors (with Applications to Calibration, Regression Curves, and Simulation-Based Inference)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a kernel-based measure for detecting differences between two conditional distributions. Using the `kernel trick' and nearest-neighbor graphs, we propose a consistent estimate of this measure which can be computed in nearly linear time (for a fixed number of nearest neighbors). Moreover, when the two conditional distributions are the same, the estimate has a Gaussian limit and its asymptotic variance has a simple form that can be easily estimated from the data. The resulting test attains precise asymptotic level and is universally consistent for detecting differences between two conditional distributions. We also provide a resampling based test using our estimate that applies to the conditional goodness-of-fit problem, which controls Type I error in finite samples and is asymptotically consistent with only a finite number of resamples. A method to de-randomize the resampling test is also presented. The proposed methods can be readily applied to a broad range of problems, ranging from classical nonparametric statistics to modern machine learning. Specifically, we explore three applications: testing model calibration, regression curve evaluation, and validation of emulator models in simulation-based inference. We illustrate the superior performance of our method for these tasks, both in simulations as well as on real data. In particular, we apply our method to (1) assess the calibration of neural network models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, (2) compare regression functions for wind power generation across two different turbines, and (3) validate emulator models on benchmark examples with intractable posteriors and for generating synthetic `redshift' associated with galaxy images.</description>
