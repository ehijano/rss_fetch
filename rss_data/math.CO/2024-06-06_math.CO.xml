      <title>Seymour and Woodall's conjecture holds for graphs with independence number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Woodall (and Seymour independently) in 2001 proposed a conjecture that every graph $G$ contains every complete bipartite graph on $\chi(G)$ vertices as a minor, where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$. In this paper, we prove that for each positive integer $\ell$ with $2\ell \leq \chi(G)$, each graph $G$ with independence number two contains a $K^{\ell}_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$-minor, implying that Seymour and Woodall's conjecture holds for graphs with independence number two, where $K^{\ell}_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$ is the graph obtained from $K_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$ by making every pair of vertices on the side of the bipartition of size $\ell$ adjacent.</description>

      <title>Weak Degeneracy of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak degeneracy of a graph $G$ is a numerical parameter that was recently introduced by the first two authors with the aim of understanding the power of greedy algorithms for graph coloring. Every $d$-degenerate graph is weakly $d$-degenerate, but the converse is not true in general (for example, all connected $d$-regular graphs except cycles and cliques are weakly $(d-1)$-degenerate). If $G$ is weakly $d$-degenerate, then the list-chromatic number of $G$ is at most $d+1$, and the same upper bound holds for various other parameters such as the DP-chromatic number and the paint number. Here we rectify a mistake in a paper of the first two authors and give a correct proof that planar graphs are weakly $4$-degenerate, strengthening the famous result of Thomassen that planar graphs are $5$-list-colorable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any generating set $S$ of $\Gamma=\mathbb {Z}^n$, the continuous edge chromatic number of the Schreier graph of the Bernoulli shift action $G=F(S,2^\Gamma)$ is $\chi'_c(G)=\chi'(G)+1$. In particular, for the standard generating set, the continuous edge chromatic number of $F(2^{\mathbb {Z}^n})$ is $2n+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We considered the properties of generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers class. The analogues of well-known Fibonacci identities for generalized numbers are obtained. We gained a new identity of product convolution of generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.

      <title>Maximal number of subword occurrences in a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the number of occurrences of subwords (non-consecutive sub-sequences) in a given word. We first define the notion of subword entropy of a given word that measures the maximal number of occurrences among all possible subwords. We then give upper and lower bounds of minimal subword entropy for words of fixed length in a fixed alphabet, and also showing that minimal subword entropy per letter has a limit value. A better upper bound of minimal subword entropy for a binary alphabet is then given by looking at certain families of periodic words. We also give some conjectures based on experimental observations</description>

      <title>Symplectic geometry of electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we relate a well-known in symplectic geometry compactification of the space of symmetric bilinear forms on the Lagrangian Grassmannian to the specific compactifications of the space of electrical networks in the disc obtained in \cite{L}, \cite{CGS} and \cite{BGKT}. In particular, we state an explicit connection between these works and describe some of the combinatorics developed there in the language of symplectic geometry. We also show that the combinatorics of the concordance vectors forces the uniqueness of the symplectic form, such that corresponding points of the Grassmannian are isotropic. We define a notion of Lagrangian concordance which provides a construction of the compactification of the space of electrical networks in the positive part of the Lagrangian Grassmannian bypassing the construction from \cite{L}.</description>

      <title>Refined Horton-Strahler numbers I: a discrete bijection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Horton-Strahler number of a rooted tree $T$ is the height of the tallest complete binary tree that can be homeomorphically embedded in $T$. The number of full binary trees with $n$ internal vertices and Horton-Strahler number $s$ is known to be the same as the number of Dyck paths of length $2n$ whose height $h$ satisfies $\lfloor \log_2(1+h)\rfloor=s$.
  In this paper, we present a new bijective proof of the above result, that in fact strengthens and refines it as follows. We introduce a sequence of trees $(\tau_i,i \ge 0)$ which "interpolates" the complete binary trees, in the sense that $\tau_{2^h-1}$ is the complete binary tree of height $h$ for all $h \ge 0$, and $\tau_{i+1}$ strictly contains $\tau_i$ for all $i \ge 0$. Defining $\mathcal{S}(T)$ to be the largest $i$ for which $\tau_i$ can be homeomorphically embedded in $T$, we then show that the number of full binary trees $T$ with $n$ internal vertices and with $\mathcal{S}(T)=h$ is the same as the number of Dyck paths of length $2n$ with height $h$. (We call $\mathcal{S}(T)$ the refined Horton-Strahler number of $T$.)
  Our proof is bijective and relies on a recursive decomposition of binary trees (resp. Dyck paths) into subtrees with strictly smaller refined Horton-Strahler number (resp. subpaths with strictly smaller height). In a subsequent paper, we will show that the bijection has a continuum analogue, which transforms a Brownian continuum random tree into a Brownian excursion and under which (a continuous analogue of) the refined Horton-Strahler number of the tree becomes the height of the excursion.</description>

      <title>A closure for Hamilton-connectedness in $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a closure technique for Hamilton-connectedness of $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graphs, where $\Gamma_3$ is the graph obtained by joining two vertex-disjoint triangles with a path of length $3$. The closure turns a claw-free graph into a line graph of a multigraph while preserving its (non)-Hamilton-connectedness. The most technical parts of the proof are computer-assisted.
  The main application of the closure is given in a subsequent paper showing that every $3$-connected $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graph is Hamilton-connected, thus resolving one of the two last open cases in the characterization of pairs of connected forbidden subgraphs implying Hamilton-connectedness.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers and extremal structures in polar spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use $p$-rank bounds on partial ovoids and the classical bounds on Ramsey numbers to obtain various upper bounds on partial $m$-ovoids in finite polar spaces. These bounds imply non-existence of $m$-ovoids for various new families of polar spaces. We give a probabilistic construction of large partial $m$-ovoids when $m$ grows linearly with the rank of the polar space.
  In the special case of the symplectic spaces over the binary field, we show an equivalence between partial $m$-ovoids and a generalisation of the Oddtown theorem from extremal set theory that has been studied under the name of nearly $m$-orthogonal sets over finite fields. We give new constructions for partial $m$-ovoids in these spaces and thus $m$-nearly orthogonal sets, for small values of $m$. These constructions use triangle-free graphs whose complements have low $\mathbb{F}_2$-rank and we give an asymptotic improvement over the state of the art. We also prove new lower bounds in the recently introduced rank-Ramsey problem for triangles vs cliques</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In new progress on conjectures of Stein, and Addario-Berry, Havet, Linhares Sales, Reed and Thomass\'e, we prove that every oriented graph with all in- and out-degrees greater than 5k/8 contains an alternating path of length k. This improves on previous results of Klimo\v{s}ov\'a and Stein, and Chen, Hou and Zhou.</description>

      <title>Matroids over tropical extensions of tracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tract $F$ is an algebraic structure where multiplication is defined but addition is only partially defined. They were introduced by Baker and Bowler as a unified framework to study generalisations of matroids, including oriented and valuated matroids. A tropical extension $F[\Gamma]$ is a tract obtained by extending a tract $F$ by an ordered abelian group $\Gamma$. Key examples include the tropical hyperfield as a tropical extension of the Krasner hyperfield, and the signed tropical hyperfield as a tropical extension of the sign hyperfield.
  We study matroids over tropical extensions of tracts, including valuated matroids and oriented valuated matroids. We generalise the correspondence between valuated matroids and their initial matroids, showing that $M$ is an $F[\Gamma]$-matroid if and only if every initial matroid $M^u$ is an $F$-matroid. We also show analogous results for flag matroids and positroids over tropical extensions, utilising the circuit and covector descriptions we derive for $F[\Gamma]$-matroids.
  We conclude by studying images of linear spaces in enriched valuations, valuation maps enriched with additional data. These give rise to enriched tropical linear spaces, including signed tropical linear spaces as a key examples. As an application of our results, we prove a structure theorem for enriched tropical linear spaces, generalising the characterisation of projective tropical linear spaces of Brandt-Eur-Zhang.</description>

      <title>On semi-transitive orientability of circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be word-representable if a word $w$ can be formed using the letters of the alphabet $V$ such that for every pair of vertices $x$ and $y$, $xy \in E$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$. A \textit{semi-transitive} orientation is an acyclic directed graph where for any directed path $v_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow v_m$, $m \ge 2$ either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$ or for all $1 \le i &lt; j \le m$ there is an arc between $v_i$ and $v_j$. An undirected graph is semi-transitive if it admits a semi-transitive orientation. For given positive integers $n, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$, we consider the undirected circulant graph with set of vertices $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$ and the set of edges$\{ij ~ | ~ (i - j) \pmod n$ or $(j-i) \pmod n$ are in $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\}\}$, where $ 0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; a_k &lt; (n+1)/2$. Recently, Kitaev and Pyatkin have shown that every $4$-regular circulant graph is semi-transitive. Further, they have posed an open problem regarding the semi-transitive orientability of circulant graphs for which the elements of the set $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\}$ are consecutive positive integers.
  In this paper, we solve the problem mentioned above. In addition, we show that under certain assumptions, some $k(\ge5)$-regular circulant graphs are semi-transitive, and some are not. Moreover, since a semi-transitive orientation is a characterisation of word-representability, we give some upper bound for the representation number of certain $k$-regular circulant graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved stability for the size and structure of sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ be a finite set. It is known that the sumset $NA$ has predictable size ($\vert NA\vert = P_A(N)$ for some $P_A(X) \in \mathbb{Q}[X]$) and structure (all of the lattice points in some finite cone other than all of the lattice points in a finite collection of exceptional subcones), once $N$ is larger than some threshold. In previous work, joint with Shakan, the first and third named authors established the first effective bounds for both of these thresholds for an arbitrary set $A$. In this article we substantially improve each of these bounds, coming much closer to the corresponding lower bounds known.</description>

      <title>Sparse Sets in Triangle-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of vertices is $k$-sparse if it induces a graph with a maximum degree of at most $k$. In this missive, we consider the order of the largest $k$-sparse set in a triangle-free graph of fixed order. We show, for example, that every triangle-free graph of order 11 contains a 1-sparse 5-set; every triangle-free graph of order 13 contains a 2-sparse 7-set; and every triangle-free graph of order 8 contains a 3-sparse 6-set. Further, these are all best possible.
  For fixed $k$, we consider the growth rate of the largest $k$-sparse set of a triangle-free graph of order $n$. Also, we consider Ramsey numbers of the following type. Given $i$, what is the smallest $n$ having the property that all triangle-free graphs of order $n$ contain a 4-cycle or a $k$-sparse set of order $i$. We use both direct proof techniques and an efficient graph enumeration algorithm to obtain several values for defective Ramsey numbers and a parameter related to largest sparse sets in triangle-free graphs, along with their extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Nordhaus-Gaddum inequalities for the number of cliques in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nordhaus and Gaddum proved sharp upper and lower bounds on the sum and product of the chromatic number of a graph and its complement. Over the years, similar inequalities have been shown for a plenitude of different graph invariants. In this paper, we consider such inequalities for the number of cliques (complete subgraphs) in a graph $G$, denoted $k(G)$. We note that some such inequalities have been well-studied, e.g., lower bounds on $k(G)+k(\overline{G})=k(G)+i(G)$, where $i(G)$ is the number of independent subsets of $G$, has been come to be known as the study of Ramsey multiplicity. We give a history of such problems. One could consider fixed sized versions of these problems as well. We also investigate multicolor versions of these problems, meaning we $r$-color the edges of $K_n$ yielding graphs $G_1,G_2,\ldots,G_r$ and give bounds on $\sum k(G_i)$ and $\prod k(G_i)$.</description>

      <title>Regular set in Cayley sum mgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $C$ of the vertex set of a graph $\Gamma$ is said to be $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular if $C$ induces an $\alpha$-regular subgraph and every vertex outside $C$ is adjacent to exactly $\beta$ vertices in $C$. In particular, if $C$ is an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set in some Cayley sum graph of a finite group $G$ with connection set $S$, then $C$ is called an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set of $G$ and a $(0,1)$-regular set is called a perfect code of $G$. By Sq$(G)$ and NSq$(G)$ we mean the set of all square elements and non-square elements of $G$. As one of the main results in this note, we show that a subgroup $H$ of a finite abelian group $G$ is an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set of $G$, for each $0\leq \alpha \leq |$NSq$(G)\cap H|$ and $0\leq \beta \leq \mathcal{L}(H)$, where $\mathcal{L}(H)=|H|$, if Sq$(G) \subseteq H$ and $\mathcal{L}(H)=|$NSq$(G)\cap H|$, otherwise. As a consequence of our result we give a very brief proof for the main results in \cite{mama, ma}. Also, we consider the dihedral group $G=D_{2n} $ and for each subgroup $H $ of $G$, by giving an appropriate connection set $S$, we determine each possibility for $(\alpha, \beta)$, where $H$ is an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set of $G$.</description>

Abstract: We explore the question asking for graphs $G$ for which the total distance decreases, possibly by a fixed constant $k$, upon the removal of any of its vertices. We obtain results leading to intuition and doubts for the \v{S}olt\'es' problem ($k=0$) and its conjectures.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for $t$-Core Partitions and Stanton's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = \kappa N + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2\pi\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $\kappa$.</description>

Abstract: Let $(S,M,U)$ be a marked orbifold with or without punctures and let $\mathcal A_v$ be a quantum cluster algebra from $(S,M,U)$ with arbitrary coefficients and quantization. We provide combinatorial formulas for quantum Laurent expansion of quantum cluster variables of $\mathcal A_v$ concerning an arbitrary quantum seed. Consequently, the positivity for the quantum cluster algebra $\mathcal A_v$ is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interval poset of a permutation is the set of intervals of a permutation, ordered with respect to inclusion. It has been introduced and studied recently in [B. Tenner, arXiv:2007.06142]. We study this poset from the perspective of the decomposition trees of permutations, describing a procedure to obtain the former from the latter. We then give alternative proofs of some of the results in [B. Tenner, arXiv:2007.06142], and we solve the open problems that it posed (and some other enumerative problems) using techniques from symbolic and analytic combinatorics. Finally, we compute the M\"obius function on such posets.</description>

Abstract: A graph on at least ${{k+1}}$ vertices is uniformly $k$-connected if each pair of its vertices is connected by $k$ and not more than $k$ independent paths. We reinvestigate a recent constructive characterization of uniformly $3$-connected graphs and obtain a more detailed result that relates the number of vertices to the operations involved in constructing a respective uniformly $3$-connected graph. Furthermore, we investigate how crossing numbers and treewidths behave under the mentioned constructions. We demonstrate how these results can be utilized to study the structure and properties of uniformly $3$-connected graphs with minimum number of vertices of minimum degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any integer $k\geq 1,$ define $L_k: \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ by $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mapsto (a'_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $a'_n=\det(a_{n+i+j})_{i,j=0}^{k-1}$. Previously, Zhu showed that $L_k$ preserves the Stieltjes moment (SM) property of sequences (Proc. Am. Math. Soc., 2019). The proof used the characterization of SM sequences in terms of positive semidefinite Hankel matrices. In this note, we give another proof by viewing SM sequences as weighted enumerations of closed walks on $\mathbb{N}$. Our proof is essentially a double-counting argument that views a $k$-tuple of non-crossing Dyck paths as a single closed walk on some bipartite subgraph of $\mathbb{N}^k.$</description>

Abstract: We call a pair of vertex-disjoint, induced subtrees of a rooted trees twins if they have the same counts of vertices by out-degrees. The likely maximum size of twins in a uniformly random, rooted Cayley tree of size $n\to\infty$ is studied. It is shown that the expected number of twins of size $(2+\delta)\sqrt{\log n\cdot\log\log n}$ approaches zero, while the expected number of twins of size $(2-\delta)\sqrt{\log n\cdot\log\log n}$ approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Polytope realization of cluster structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the construction of polytope functions and several results about them in [LP], we take a deep look on their mutation behaviors to find a link between a face of a polytope and a sub-cluster algebra of the corresponding cluster algebra. This find provides a way to induce a mutation sequence in a sub-cluster algebra from that in the cluster algebra in totally sign-skew-symmetric case analogous to that achieved via cluster scattering diagram in skew-symmetrizable case by [GHKK] and [M].
  With this, we are able to generalize compatibility degree in [CL] and then obtain an equivalent condition of compatibility which does not rely on clusters and thus can be generalized for all polytope functions. Therefore, we could regard compatibility as an intrinsic property of variables, which explains the unistructurality of cluster algebras. According to such cluster structure of polytope functions, we construct a fan $\mathcal{C}$ containing all cones in the $g$-fan.
  On the other hand, we also find a realization of $G$-matrices and $C$-matrices in polytopes by the mutation behaviors of polytopes, which helps to generalize the dualities between $G$-matrices and $C$-matrices introduced in [NZ] and leads to another polytope explanation of cluster structures. This allows us to construct another fan $\mathcal{N}$ which also contains all cones in the $g$-fan.</description>

      <title>Paired coalition in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \noindent A paired coalition in a graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a paired dominating set but whose union $V_1 \cup V_2$ is a paired dominating set. A paired coalition partition (abbreviated $pc$-partition) in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi= \lbrace V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k \rbrace$ such that each set $V_i$ of $\pi$ is not a paired dominating set but forms a paired coalition with another set $V_j \in \pi$. The paired coalition graph $PCG(G,\pi) $ of the graph $G$ and the $pc$-partition $\pi$ of $G$, is the graph whose vertices correspond one-to-one with the sets of $\pi$, and two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent in $PCG(G,\pi) $ if and only if their corresponding sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ form a paired coalition in $G$. In this paper, we initiate the study of paired coalition partitions and paired coalition graphs. In particular, we determine the paired coalition number of paths and cycles, obtain some results on paired coalition partitions in trees and characterize pair coalition graphs of paths, cycles and trees. We also characterize triangle-free graphs $G$ with $PC(G)=n$ and unicyclic graphs $G$ with $PC(G)=n-2$.</description>

Abstract: Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ and a set of $k$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$, the generalized Ramsey number $f(G,\mathcal{H},q)$ is the minimum number of colors needed to edge-color $G$ so that every copy of every hypergraph $H\in \mathcal{H}$ in $G$ receives at least $q$ different colors. In this note we obtain bounds, some asymptotically sharp, on several generalized Ramsey numbers, when $G=K_n$ or $G=K_{n,n}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ is a set of cycles or paths, and when $G=K_n^k$ and $\mathcal{H}$ contains a clique on $k+2$ vertices or a tight cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given graphs $G, H$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, the generalized Ramsey number, denoted $r(G,H,q)$, is the minimum number of colours needed to edge-colour $G$ such that every copy of $H$ receives at least $q$ colours. In this paper, we prove that for a fixed integer $k \ge 3$, we have $r(K_n,C_k,3) = n/(k-2)+o(n)$. This generalises work of Joos and Muybayi, who proved $r(K_n,C_4,3) = n/2+o(n)$. We also provide an upper bound on $r(K_{n,n}, C_k, 3)$, which generalises a result of Joos and Mubayi that $r(K_{n,n},C_4,3) = 2n/3+o(n)$. Both of our results are in fact specific cases of more general theorems concerning families of cycles.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of soliton lengths in a multicolor box-ball system</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.04458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>Finding lower bounds on the growth and entropy of subshifts over countable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a lower bound on the growth of a subshift based on a simple condition on the set of forbidden patterns defining that subshift. Aubrun et Al. showed a similar result based on the Lov\'asz Local Lemma for subshift over any countable group and Bernshteyn extended their approach to deduce, amongst other things, some lower bound on the exponential growth of the subshift. However, our result has a simpler proof, is easier to use for applications, and provides better bounds on the applications from their articles (although it is not clear that our result is stronger in general).
  In the particular case of subshift over $\mathbb{Z}$ a similar but weaker condition given by Miller was known to imply nonemptiness of the associated shift. Pavlov used the same approach to provide a condition that implied exponential growth. We provide a version of our result for this particular setting and it is provably strictly stronger than the result of Pavlov and the result of Miller (and, in practice, leads to considerable improvement in the applications).
  We also apply our two results to a few different problems including strongly aperiodic subshifts, nonrepetitive subshifts, and Kolmogorov complexity of subshifts.</description>

Abstract: We determine the Gromov--Hausdorff--Prokhorov scaling limits and local limits of Kemp's $d$-dimensional binary trees and other models of supertrees. The limits exhibit a root vertex with infinite degree and are constructed by rescaling infinitely many independent stable trees or other spaces according to a function of a two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet process and gluing them together at their roots. We discuss universality aspects of random spaces constructed in this fashion and sketch a phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>

Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is an $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>Two new proofs of partial Godbersen's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two new proofs are provided, offering two new perspectives on Godbersen's conjecture. One of the proofs utilizes Helly's theorem to provide a concise and elegant proof of the inequality in Godbersen's conjecture. The other proof utilizes the Brunn-Minkowski inequality to provide a completely new proof of the inclusion $-K\subset nK$ for convex bodies $K$ with centroid at the origin, thereby proving Godbersen's conjecture.</description>
