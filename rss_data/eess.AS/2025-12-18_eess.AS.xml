      <title>On the Use of Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Speaker Diarization and Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models such as wav2vec2.0 and WavLM have been shown to significantly improve the performance of many downstream speech tasks, especially in low-resource settings, over the past few years. Despite this, evaluations on tasks such as Speaker Diarization and Speech Separation remain limited. This paper investigates the quality of recent self-supervised speech representations on these two speaker identity-related tasks, highlighting gaps in the current literature that stem from limitations in the existing benchmarks, particularly the lack of diversity in evaluation datasets and variety in downstream systems associated to both diarization and separation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multimodal Person Recognition: A Robust Framework for Handling Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Conditioned UNet for Music Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a conditioned UNet for Music Source Separation (MSS). MSS is generally performed by multi-output neural networks, typically UNets, with each output representing a particular stem from a predefined instrument vocabulary. In contrast, conditioned MSS networks accept an audio query related to a stem of interest alongside the signal from which that stem is to be extracted. Thus, a strict vocabulary is not required and this enables more realistic tasks in MSS. The potential of conditioned approaches for such tasks has been somewhat hidden due to a lack of suitable data, an issue recently addressed with the MoisesDb dataset. A recent method, Banquet, employs this dataset with promising results seen on larger vocabularies. Banquet uses Bandsplit RNN rather than a UNet and the authors state that UNets should not be suitable for conditioned MSS. We counter this argument and propose QSCNet, a novel conditioned UNet for MSS that integrates network conditioning elements in the Sparse Compressed Network for MSS. We find QSCNet to outperform Banquet by over 1dB SNR on a couple of MSS tasks, while using less than half the number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Single-channel speech enhancement by using psychoacoustical model inspired fusion framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the parameters of Bayesian Short-time Spectral Amplitude (STSA) estimator for speech enhancement are selected based on the characteristics of the human auditory system, the gain function of the estimator becomes more flexible. Although this type of estimator in acoustic domain is quite effective in reducing the back-ground noise at high frequencies, it produces more speech distortions, which make the high-frequency contents of the speech such as friciatives less perceptible in heavy noise conditions, resulting in intelligibility reduction. On the other hand, the speech enhancement scheme, which exploits the psychoacoustic evidence of frequency selectivity in the modulation domain, is found to be able to increase the intelligibility of noisy speech by a substantial amount, but also suffers from the temporal slurring problem due to its essential design constraint. In order to achieve the joint improvements in both the perceived speech quality and intelligibility, we proposed and investigated a fusion framework by combining the merits of acoustic and modulation domain approaches while avoiding their respective weaknesses. Objective measure evaluation shows that the proposed speech enhancement fusion framework can provide consistent improvements in the perceived speech quality and intelligibility across different SNR levels in various noise conditions, while compared to the other baseline techniques.</description>

      <title>Steering Language Model to Stable Speech Emotion Recognition via Contextual Perception and Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale audio language models (ALMs), such as Qwen2-Audio, are capable of comprehending diverse audio signal, performing audio analysis and generating textual responses. However, in speech emotion recognition (SER), ALMs often suffer from hallucinations, resulting in misclassifications or irrelevant outputs. To address these challenges, we propose C$^2$SER, a novel ALM designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of SER through Contextual perception and Chain of Thought (CoT). C$^2$SER integrates the Whisper encoder for semantic perception and Emotion2Vec-S for acoustic perception, where Emotion2Vec-S extends Emotion2Vec with semi-supervised learning to enhance emotional discrimination. Additionally, C$^2$SER employs a CoT approach, processing SER in a step-by-step manner while leveraging speech content and speaking styles to improve recognition. To further enhance stability, C$^2$SER introduces self-distillation from explicit CoT to implicit CoT, mitigating error accumulation and boosting recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments show that C$^2$SER outperforms existing popular ALMs, such as Qwen2-Audio and SECap, delivering more stable and precise emotion recognition. We release the training code, checkpoints, and test sets to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders Make Audio Foundation Models more Explainable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio pretrained models are widely employed to solve various tasks in speech processing, sound event detection, or music information retrieval. However, the representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems. Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes, establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors encoded in the representations.</description>
