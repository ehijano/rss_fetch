      <title>Observationally derived magnetic field strength and 3D components in the HD 142527 disk</title>

Abstract: In protoplanetary disks around young stars, magnetic fields play an important role for disk evolution and planet formation. Polarized thermal emission from magnetically aligned grains is one of the reliable methods to trace magnetic fields. However, it has been difficult to observe magnetic fields from dust polarization in protoplanetary disks because other polarization mechanisms involving grown dust grains become efficient. Here, we report multi-wavelength (0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.7 mm) observations of polarized thermal emission in the protoplanetary disk around HD 142527, showing the lopsided dust distribution. We revealed that the smaller dust still exhibits magnetic alignment in the southern part of the disk. Furthermore, angular offsets between the observed magnetic field and the disk azimuthal direction were discovered, which can be used as a method to measure the relative strengths of each component (radial ($B_r$), azimuthal ($B_\phi$), and vertical ($B_z$)) of 3D magnetic field. Applying this method, we derived the magnetic field around a 200-au radius from the protostar as $|B_r |:|B_\phi |:|B_z | \sim 0.26:1:0.23$ and a strength of $\sim 0.3$ milli-Gauss. Our observations provide some key parameters of magnetic activities including the plasma beta, which have only been assumed in theoretical studies. In addition, the radial and vertical angular momentum transfer are found to be comparable, which poses a challenge to theoretical studies of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Current Theories of Lunar Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic theory of cold-trapped ice on the Moon and some alternatives are reviewed and compared with observational constraints. The emphasis is on fundamental theoretical concepts. The "standard model" of lunar ice involves moderate modifications of the classical ideas and is consistent with major observational constraints. Only a few less established observational claims are unaccounted for. The text assumes some familiarity with the topic of lunar polar volatiles.</description>

      <title>Radial velocity homogeneous analysis of M dwarfs observed with HARPS I. Exoplanet detection and candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The census of planets around M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood meets two challenges: detecting the best targets for the future characterisation of planets with ELTs, and studying the statistics of planet occurrence that are crucial to formation scenarios. The radial velocity (RV) method remains the most appropriate for such a census as it is sensitive to the widest ranges of masses and periods. HARPS, mounted on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory (ESO, Chile), has been obtaining velocity measurements since 2003, and can therefore be used to analyse a very large and homogeneous dataset. We performed a homogeneous analysis of the RV time series of 200 M dwarfs observed with HARPS from 2003 to 2019 (gathering more than 15000 spectra), with the aim of understanding detectable signals such as stellar and planetary companions and activity signals. The RVs were computed with a template matching method before carrying out the time series analysis. First, we focused on the systematic analysis of the presence of a dominant long-term pattern in the RV time series (linear or quadratic trend and sine function). Then, we analysed higher-frequency perdiodic signals using periodograms of the residual time series and Keplerian function fitting. We found long-term variability in 57 RV time series (28.5%). This led to the revision of the parameters of the massive planet (GJ9482 b), as well as the detection of four substellar and stellar companions (around GJ3307, GJ4001, GJ4254, andGJ9588), for which we characterised inclinations and masses by combining RV and astrometry. The periodic analysis allowed us to recover 97% of the planetary systems already published in this sample, but also to propose three new planetary candidates orbiting GJ300 (7.3Me), GJ654(5Me), and GJ739 (39Me), which require additional measurements before they can be confirmed.</description>

      <title>Radial velocity homogeneous analysis of M dwarfs observed with HARPS. II. Detection limits and planetary occurrence statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-determine planetary occurrences around M dwarfs using 20 years of observations from HARPS on 197 targets. The first aim of this study is to propose more precise occurrence rates using the large volume of the sample but also variations to previous calculations, particularly by considering multiplicity, which is now an integral part of planetary occurrence calculations. The second aim is to exploit the extreme longevity of HARPS to determine occurrence rates in the unexplored domain of very long periods. This work relies entirely on the 197 radial velocity time series obtained and analysed in our previous study. By considering they are cleaned of any detectable signal, we convert them into detection limits. We use these 197 limits to produce a detectability map and combine it with confirmed planet detections to establish our occurrence rates. Finally, we also convert the detection limits from orbital period to insolation in order to construct an occurrence statistics for the temperate zone. We find a strong prevalence of low-mass planets around M dwarfs, with an occurrence rate of 120% for planets with a mass between 0.75 and 3 Me. In addition, we compute an occurrence rate of 45.3% +20-16% for temperate zone planets around M dwarfs. We obtain an occurrence rate of a few percent for giant planets with wide separations. In our sample these giant planets with wide separations are only detected around the most massive M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>On the Orbit of the Binary Brown Dwarf Companion GL229 Ba and Bb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The companion GL229B was recently resolved by Xuan et al. (2024) as a tight binary of two brown dwarfs (Ba and Bb) through VLTI-GRAVITY interferometry and VLT-CRIRES+ RV measurements. Here, we present Bayesian models of the interferometric and RV data in additional detail, along with an updated outer orbit of the brown dwarf pair about the primary. To create a model of the inner orbit with robust uncertainties, we apply kernel phases to the GRAVITY data to address baseline redundancy in the raw closure phases. Using parallel tempering, we constrain the binary's orbit using only VLTI-GRAVITY data, despite each epoch having low visibility-plane coverage and/or SNR. We demonstrate very agreement the VLTI-GRAVITY and CRIRES+ datasets and find that the inner binary has a period of 12.1346$\pm$0.0011 days, eccentricity of 0.2317$\pm$0.0025, and total mass of 71.0$\pm$0.4 Mjup, with Ba and Bb having masses of 37.7$\pm$1.1Mjup and 33.4$\pm$1.0Mjup respectively. With new Keck/NIRC2 astrometry, we update the outer orbit GL229B around the primary. We find a semi-major axis of 42.9+3.0-2.4AU, eccentricity of 0.736$\pm$0.014, and a total mass for B of 71.7$\pm$0.6Mjup, consistent with that derived from the inner orbit. We find a mutual inclination of 31$\pm$2.5deg, below the threshold for Kozai-Lidov oscillations. The agreement on the mass of Ba+Bb between the inner and outer orbits is an important test of our ability to model RV, astrometry, and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. Our methodological advances in handling interferometric data with low SNR and sparse UV-coverage will benefit future observations of rapidly-orbiting companions with VLTI-GRAVITY.</description>

      <title>A ZTF Search for Circumstellar Debris Transits in White Dwarfs: Six New Candidates, one with Gas Disk Emission, identified in a Novel Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) showing transits from orbiting planetary debris provide significant insights into the structure and dynamics of debris disks. This is a rare class of objects with only eight published systems. In this work, we perform a systematic search for such systems within 500 pc in the Gaia-eDR3 catalog of WDs using the light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and present six new candidates. Our selection process targets the top 1% most photometrically variable sources identified using a combined variability metric from ZTF and Gaia eDR3 photometry, boosted by a metric space we define using von Neumann statistics and Pearson-Skew as a novel discovery tool to identify these systems. This is followed by optical spectroscopic observations of visually selected variables to confirm metal pollution. Four of the six systems show long-timescale photometric variability spanning several months to years, resulting either from long-term evolution of transit activity or dust and debris clouds at wide orbits. Among them, WD J1013-0427 shows an indication of reddening during the long-duration dip. Interpreting this as dust extinction makes it the first system to indicate an abundance of small dust grains (radius $\lesssim$$0.3~{\rm \mu m}$) in the occulting material. The same object also shows metal emission lines that map an optically thick eccentric gas disk orbiting within the star's Roche limit. For each candidate, we infer the abundances of the photospheric metals and estimate accretion rates. We show that transiting debris systems tend to have higher inferred accretion rates compared to the general population of metal-polluted WDs. Growing the number of these systems will further illuminate such comparative properties in the near future. Separately, we also serendipitously discovered an AM CVn showing a very long-duration outburst $-$ only the fourth such system to be known.</description>

      <title>The Elemental Abundances of Ryugu: Assessment of Chemical Heterogeneities and the Nugget Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled ~5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. In this study, we have summarized the elemental abundances of Ryugu samples published to date, and evaluated their compositional variability associated with the CI chondrite data. The abundances of some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) in individual Ryugu particles were found to show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements, presumably due to the nugget effect of aqueously formed minor secondary minerals (e.g., dolomite, apatite, magnetite, and pyrrhotite). Consequently, the mean abundances of Ryugu for these elements, calculated using currently available Ryugu data, are accompanied by a certain degree of uncertainties. We suggest establishing a consortium to determine the representative elemental abundances of Ryugu by measuring aliquots from a large homogenized powder sample that can mitigate the nugget effect. Our statistical calculation shows that at least 750 and 400 mg of homogenized samples from Chambers A and C, respectively, are needed to achieve within +/-5% compositional heterogeneity. The data obtained throughout the consortium activity complement the scientific objectives of the Hayabusa2 mission. Moreover, we anticipate that the obtained Ryugu data, coupled with the elemental abundances of CI chondrites, provide new insights into the chemical composition of the Solar System, which will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.</description>

      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes "dangerous". We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as "red nugget relics", as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples).</description>

      <title>Mechanical softening and enhanced elasticity of lunar olivine probed via nanoindentation and high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. Also, we have performed synchrotron-based high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the compressibility properties of this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, of three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine relative to terrestrial olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite. The origin of the observed differences is discussed. A simple model combining the results of both our nanoindentation and HP-XRD measurements allows us to describe the contribution of macroscopic and chemical-bond related effects, both of which are necessary to reproduce the observed elastic modulus softening. Such joint analysis of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue for characterizing these highly interesting materials.</description>

      <title>KOBE-1: The first planetary system from the KOBE survey. Two planets likely residing in the sub-Neptune mass regime around a late K-dwarf</title>

Abstract: K-dwarf stars are promising targets in the exploration of potentially habitable planets. Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an optimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection. The KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring the radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES spectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the habitable zone of their system. In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to characterize planetary signals in the K7V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to constrain the planetary population within its habitable zone. We used 82 CARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a GLS periodogram to search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with Keplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian framework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative configurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS sectors in search of planetary signals. We identified two signals: at 8.5d and 29.7d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other non-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80+/-0.76ME and 12.4+/-1.1ME, corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a high certainty (&gt;99.7%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time series to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5ME within the habitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose origin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1sigma with a transit from planet c. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this system, concluding that nulling interferometry with the LIFE mission could be capable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres in future studies.</description>

      <title>A possible trail of dust from a young, highly-extincted brown dwarf in the outskirts of the Trapezium Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of a highly-extincted ($A_V\sim52$) candidate brown dwarf ($\sim0.018$M$_\odot$) in the outskirts of the Trapezium Cluster that appears to be coincident with the end of a $\sim 1700\,$au long, remarkably uniformly wide, dark trail that broadens only slightly at the end opposite the point source. We examine whether a dusty trail associated with a highly-extincted brown dwarf could plausibly be detected with JWST and explore possible origins. We show that a dusty trail associated with the brown dwarf could be observable if dust within it is larger than that in the ambient molecular cloud. For example, if the ambient cloud has a standard $\sim0.25$$\mu$m maximum grain size and the trail contains micron-sized grains, then the trail will have a scattering opacity over an order of magnitude larger compared to the surroundings in NIRCam short-wavelength filters. We use a simple model to show that a change in maximum grain size can reproduce the high $A_V$ and the multi-filter NIRCam contrast seen between the trail and its surroundings. We propose and explore two possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the trail: i) a weak FUV radiation-driven wind from the circum-brown dwarf disc due to the O stars in the region and ii) a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion wake. The former would be the most distant known case of the Trapezium stars' radiation driving winds from a disc, and the latter would be the first known example of ``late'' infall from the interstellar medium onto a low mass object in a high-mass star-forming region.</description>
