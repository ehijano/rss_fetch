      <title>Information Design for Adaptive Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the optimal design of information sharing in organizations. Organizational performance depends on agents adapting to uncertain external environments while coordinating their actions, where coordination incentives and synergies are modeled as graphs (networks). The equilibrium strategies and the principal's objective function are summarized using Laplacian matrices of these graphs. I formulate a Bayesian persuasion problem to determine the optimal public signal and show that it comprises a set of statistics on local states, necessarily including their average, which serves as the organizational goal. When the principal benefits equally from the coordination of any two agents, the choice of disclosed statistics is based on the Laplacian eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the incentive graph. The algebraic connectivity (the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue) determines the condition for full revelation, while the Laplacian spectral radius (the largest Laplacian eigenvalue) establishes the condition for minimum transparency, where only the average state is disclosed.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statics for the Subjective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I conduct a robust comparative statics exercise for a risk-averse subjective expected utility (SEU) maximizer. Starting with a finite menu of actions totally ordered by sensitivity to risk, I study the transformations of the menu that lead the decision-maker to take a lower action, regardless of her particular utility function or belief. My main results reveal that a robust decrease in the action selected is guaranteed by an intuitive steepening of the actions' payoffs and necessitates a slightly weaker such steepening. I show that this basic pattern generalizes to a broad class of non-EU preferences.</description>

      <title>Correlation Neglect in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple framework to study the effect of correlation neglect on social learning and welfare in games with social incentives. It examines statistical learners (frequentists, Bayesians, etc.) who make decisions based on their peers' actions but overlook the correlation between the actions they observe. A novel solution concept called correlated sampling equilibrium with statistical inference (CoSESI) reveals that correlation neglect affects strategic behavior through persistent overprecision, which leads to polarization and information cascades. CoSESI always exists and differs from existing concepts. It captures the fact that naive beliefs are overly sensitive to correlations, which causes failures of social learning. Applications of CoSESI in matching markets, monopoly pricing, and financial markets demonstrate that correlation neglect bears significant economic consequences.</description>

      <title>Intensinist Social Welfare and Ordinal Intensity-Efficient Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies social welfare and allocation efficiency in situations where, in addition to having ordinal preferences, agents also have *ordinal intensities*: they can make comparisons such as "I prefer a to b more than I prefer c to d" without necessarily being able to quantify them. In this new informational environment for social choice, the paper first introduces a rank-based criterion for interpersonal comparisons of such ordinal intensities. Building on it, the "intensinist" social welfare function is introduced. This maps profiles of ordinal intensities to weak orders over social alternatives using a scoring method which generalizes that of the classic Borda count in a way that allows for differences in agents' intensities to be reflected in preference aggregation more accurately and in a much richer class of situations. Building on the same comparability criterion, the paper also studies the classic assignment problem by defining an allocation to be "intensity-efficient" if it is Pareto efficient with respect to the preferences induced by the agents' intensities and also such that, when another allocation assigns the same pairs of items to the same pairs of agents but in a "flipped" way, the former allocation assigns the commonly preferred item in every such pair to the agent who prefers it more. Some first results on the (non-)existence of such allocations are presented without imposing restrictions on preferences or intensities other than strictness, and the relation -- or lack thereof -- is studied between intensity-efficient and classical utilitarian allocations.</description>

      <title>Continuous Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the classical model of DeGroot (1974) to a continuum of agents when they interact among them according to a DiKernel. We show that, under some regularity assumptions, the continuous model is the limit case of the discrete one. Additionally, we establish sufficient conditions for the emergence of consensus. We provide some applications of these results. First, we establish a canonical way to reduce the dimensionality of matrices by comparing matrices of different dimensions in the space of DiKernels. Then, we develop a model of Lobby Competition where two lobbies compete to bias the opinion of a continuum of agents. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a Nash Equilibrium and study their relation with the equilibria of discretizations of the game. Finally, we characterize the equilibrium for a particular case of DiKernels.</description>
