      <title>Criticality analysis of nuclear binding energy neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods, in particular deep learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) with many layers, have become widespread and useful tools in nuclear physics. However, these ANNs are typically treated as ``black boxes'', with their architecture (width, depth, and weight/bias initialization) and the training algorithm and parameters chosen empirically by optimizing learning based on limited exploration. We test a non-empirical approach to understanding and optimizing nuclear physics ANNs by adapting a criticality analysis based on renormalization group flows in terms of the hyperparameters for weight/bias initialization, training rates, and the ratio of depth to width. This treatment utilizes the statistical properties of neural network initialization to find a generating functional for network outputs at any layer, allowing for a path integral formulation of the ANN outputs as a Euclidean statistical field theory. We use a prototypical example to test the applicability of this approach: a simple ANN for nuclear binding energies. We find that with training using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer, the predicted criticality behavior is realized, and optimal performance is found with critical tuning. However, the use of an adaptive learning algorithm leads to somewhat superior results without concern for tuning and thus obscures the analysis. Nevertheless, the criticality analysis offers a way to look within the black box of ANNs, which is a first step towards potential improvements in network performance beyond using adaptive optimizers.</description>

      <title>Exactness of the normal-ordered two-body truncation of three-nucleon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-state based many-body methods start from Hamiltonians that are normal-ordered with respect to the reference state. In low-energy nuclear physics applications normal-ordered Hamiltonians consisting of two- and three-nucleon forces are usually truncated at the two-body rank with residual three-nucleon operators being discarded. Benchmark computations have showed that this truncation is accurate, but we lack an understanding about why it works. We show that the normal-ordered two-body truncation is exact for zero-range three-body forces when nuclei are computed using the coupled cluster with singles and doubles method. As the nuclear three-nucleon force is short ranged and a three-body contact is a leading term in effective field theories of quantum chromodynamics, our result provides an analytical basis for the popular normal-ordered two-body approximation.</description>

      <title>$A=2,3,4$ nuclear contact coefficients in the generalized contact formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical calculation for the $A = 2, 3$ and 4 nuclear contact coefficients within the generalized contact formalism, using both local and non-local chiral potentials. The Hyperspherical Harmonics method is employed to calculate the nuclear wave functions, from which we derive two-body momentum distributions and density functions to extract the contact coefficients. We have verified that the contact coefficients, extracted from two-body momentum distributions or from density functions, are consistent for a given nucleus and potential. We have also analyzed the model-independence of the ratios between the contact coefficients. This study extends previous works based on local interaction models only and explores the impact of non-local potentials on the consistency of contact coefficient ratios across different nuclei.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Toshimitsu Yamazaki (1934-2025): Quest for Exotic Hadronic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk I pay tribute to Toshimitsu Yamazaki who died earlier this year. Yamazaki's leading contributions to Hadronic Physics, in particular to Strangeness Nuclear Physics in Japan and elsewhere, are well known. Two of the five Recurring Themes of his research, as listed in the Japan Academy site, are highlighted here: (i) Discovery of deeply bound pionic-atom states, and (ii) Search for kaonic nuclei -- Kaonic Proton Matter (KPM). I conclude by reviewing briefly my own recent work, confirming Farrar's conjecture that a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon is not ruled out by the weak-decay observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei. However, the relatively long lifetime of such a deeply bound $H$ is much too short to qualify it for a Dark-Matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Coulomb-Corrected Wormhole Model for Neon-20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the spatial wormhole geometry proposed by Manton and Dunajski, we develop a modified model for the Neon-20 nucleus that incorporates a repulsive Coulomb potential. This reduces the large threshold energy for cluster break-up in the original model and converts most bound states to resonances. We use generalized WKB methods to calculate the energies of bound states, and also the energies and widths of under-barrier and over-barrier resonances. The results align closely with experimental data for the 0_1^+ , 0_1^- and 0_4^+ rotational bands of Neon-20, including the large widths in the higher-nodal 0_4^+ band.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory of renormalization group in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density functional renormalization group (density-fRG) is proposed to investigate the density fluctuations within the functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to quantify the medium effect and study physics of high densities. This method is applied to the nucleon-meson effective field theory, also known as the Walecka model, to study the properties of nuclear matter at high baryon densities. It is found that both the attractive and repulsive nucleon meson interactions are screened by the high density medium, which results in a stiffer equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter in the regime of $\rho_0 \lesssim \rho \lesssim 2.5 \rho_0$, then a softer EoS when $\rho \gtrsim 2.5 \rho_0$. Here $\rho_0$ denotes the saturation baryon density of symmetric nuclear matter. Furthermore, a new phenomenon called the locking of Fermi surface is found. In the locking of Fermi surface the effective energy of quasi-nucleon is always close to the Fermi surface, which are both running with the renormalization group scale.</description>

      <title>Bound states of $ _{c\bar{c}}^{9}$Be within $c\bar{c}+\alpha+\alpha$ cluster models based on state-of-the-art HAL QCD charmonium-nucleon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible bound state of the $ _{c\bar{c}}^{9}$Be, a charmonium-nucleus system, is investigated. The analysis is carried out within a three-cluster model, where its binary subsystems are represented as $ c\bar{c}\textrm{+}\alpha $ and $\alpha+\alpha$. The hyperspherical harmonics method is employed to facilitate a convenient description of this three-cluster configuration. The calculations are done by employing the effective $ c\bar{c}\textrm{-}\alpha $ potentials.
  These potentials were derived recently based on state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculations, which provided interactions for the spin 3/2 $J/\psi N $, spin 1/2 $J/\psi N $, spin 1/2 $\eta_{c}N$ and spin-averaged $J/\psi N$ interactions, all obtained with nearly physical pion masses. The Coulomb interaction was also incorporated into the current calculations. It is determined that, despite neither the $ _{c\bar{c}}^{5}$He nor the $^{8}$Be binary subsystems being bound, a bound state of the $ c\bar{c}\textrm{-} \alpha\alpha$ nuclear system could potentially exist. The maximum central binding energy is found to be approximately 1.71 MeV, based on the spin 1/2 $J/\psi N $ interaction, while a minimum value of about 0.56 MeV is obtained from calculations involving the spin 1/2 $\eta_{c}N$ interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated deep neural network model for inclusive electron-carbon scattering. Using the bootstrap model [Phys.Rev.C 110 (2024) 2, 025501] as a prior, we incorporate recent experimental data, as well as older measurements in the deep inelastic scattering region, to derive a re-optimized posterior model. We examine the impact of these new inputs on model predictions and associated uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the resulting cross-section predictions in the kinematic range relevant to the Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments.</description>

      <title>Lattice Calculation of Short-Range Contributions to Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay $\pi^-\to\pi^+ ee$ at Physical Pion Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decays provide an excellent probe for determining whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions. The short-range matrix elements associated with the $\pi^- \to \pi^+ ee$ process contribute at leading order in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay channel $nn \to ppee$ through pion exchange between nucleons. However, current lattice calculations show notable discrepancies in predicting these short-range contributions. To address this issue, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^- \to \pi^+ ee$ matrix elements using domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations. To mitigate contamination from around-the-world effects, we develop a new method to reconstruct and subtract them directly from lattice data. We then perform a nonperturbative renormalization using the RI/SMOM scheme. Compared with previous studies, this work reduces the uncertainties in the matrix elements and provides an independent cross-check that helps to reconcile the discrepancies among previous lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>$\nu p$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon from the chiral effective model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the confining pressure and associated global property, i.e, D-term, of the nucleon using the skyrmion approach formulated within scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory. In this framework, the nucleon is modeled as a skyrmion, and a scalar meson is introduced to incorporate the effects of the scale anomaly via low-energy theorems. The contributions from the current quark mass and gluonic dynamics to the scale anomaly are encoded through the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively. By decomposing the nucleon's energy-momentum tensor, we isolate the anomalous components and analyze their role in generating pressure. We find that the gluonic contribution to the scale anomaly plays a dominant role in producing confining pressure. In comparison with results from conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, the total pressure derived from sChPT provides improved qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results. We also evaluate the D-term and compare it with recent lattice and model-independent determinations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the away-side hadron-triggered modification factor $I_{AA}$ in $AA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies for scenarios with and without quark-gluon plasma formation in $pp$ collision. We find that for both scenarios theoretical results for $I_{AA}$ agree well with the available data for 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb and 0.2 TeV Au+Au collisions. We make predictions for $I_{AA}$ in 7 TeV O+O collisions that are planned at the LHC. Our results show that measuring $I_{OO}$ in the whole centrality interval and at small centrality ($\lesssim 5$%) may give information on the presence of jet quenching in $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>PSR J0614-3329: A NICER case for Strange Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state. The most recent NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\odot}$. Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we demonstrate using Bayesian hypothesis ranking that strange quark stars are preferred over all the physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for the possible existence of strange quark stars, suggesting that they should be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium with inclusion of scalar-isovector $\delta$ meson field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production, dynamic evolution, and decay of $\Delta$ particles play a crucial role in understanding the properties of high baryon density nuclear matter in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section ($\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$) is studied within the relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck framework, in which the $\delta$ meson field is further considered. The results show that the $\delta$ and $\rho$ meson related exchange terms have a nonnegligible contribution to the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ compared to only considering the $\rho$ meson exchange terms, although there is a significant cancellation on the cross section among these meson exchange terms. In addition, due to the different effects of the medium correction on the effective mass of neutrons, protons, and differently charged $\Delta$s, the individual $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ exhibits an ordered isospin-asymmetry ($\alpha$) dependence, and $\sigma^{*}_{n\Delta}$ and $\sigma^{*}_{p\Delta}$ have opposite $\alpha$ dependencies. And the $\alpha$ dependence of the ratio $R(\alpha)=\sigma^{*}(\alpha)/\sigma^{*}(\alpha=0)$ for $n\Delta$ reaction channels follow $n\Delta^{++}&gt;n\Delta^{+}&gt;n\Delta^{0}&gt;n\Delta^{-}$, while for $p\Delta$ it is $p\Delta^{-}&gt;p\Delta^{0}&gt;p\Delta^{+}&gt;p\Delta^{++}$. Moreover, the results also indicate that the isospin effect on the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$, which is dominantly caused by the isovector $\rho$ and $\delta$ meson fields, is still pronounced at densities up to 3 times normal nuclear density. Finally, a parametrization of the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent $N\Delta$ elastic cross section is proposed based on the microscopic calculated results, and the in-medium $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ in the energy range of $\sqrt{s}$=2.3$\sim$3.0 GeV can be well described.</description>

      <title>Greedy Emulators for Nuclear Two-Body Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples ("snapshots") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling factor for $^{28}$Si + $^{12}$C charge-changing cross sections at 90-1296 MeV/nucleon: Toward finding energy-dependent scaling factor for other elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the detailed study of the scaling factor for $^{28}$\rm Si + $^{12}$\rm C charge-changing cross sections (CCCSs) at 90-1296 MeV/nucleon, we introduced a new approach to find the systematic energy dependence of the scaling factor that can be used to predict the CCCSs for other elements. The analysis considers the study of charge-changing cross sections for $^{7,9-12,14}$\rm Be, $^{10-15,17}$\rm B, $^{12-19}$\rm C, $^{14,15,,17-22}$\rm N, $^{16,18-24}$\rm O, $^{18-21,23-26}$\rm F, and $^{42-51}$\rm Ca isotopes at 200-930 MeV/nucleon in the framework of the Glauber model. The calculations involve descriptions of nuclei in terms of the Slater determinant using harmonic oscillator single-particle wave functions. The extracted values of the scaling factor are found to provide satisfactory account of the experimental data in all the cases, except for $^{42-51}$\rm Ca isotopes where the calculated values differ significantly from the measured values. In the case of \rm Ca isotopes, however, we find that inclusion of the phase variation of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering amplitude, which is the basic input of the Glauber model, is able to provide an alternative way to serve the purpose of (phenomenological) scaling, and one gets systematically quite a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experiment. Additionally, the present work for finding the scaling factor may find its place to (i) investigate the suitability of the calculated proton radii of the exotic nuclei, given in the literature, and (ii) provide the reliable estimate for the CCCSs of those isotopes of a given element whose calculated charge radii are known, but their experimental CCCSs are not available.</description>

      <title>From Nuclear Matter with Quenched $g_A$ to Compact-Star Matter with a Signal for Emergent Hidden Scale Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ``unorthodox" idea is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be interpreted in terms of an emerging hidden scale symmetry in dense compact-star matter. Arguments are presented using an effective field theory anchored on a renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface coupled with hidden symmetric heavy mesonic degrees of freedom that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's nuclear effective field theory involving nucleon and pion fields only, referred hereon to as $\chi$EFT$_\pi$. Both hidden local and scale symmetries, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ (i.e., $f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity HQC)" is brought in via the skyrmion structure of the nucleon argued to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit and the large $N^\prime$ limit of the Grassmannian model $G/H= [O(N^\prime)/O(N^\prime-p) \times O(p)]$ where $N^\prime=4$ and $p=2$ for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry. The connection between the quenched $g_A$ and the sound speed $v^2_{s}/c^2\approx 1/3$ inside dense compact stars could be interpreted as a signal for emergent ``pseudo-conformal" symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spectral BBGKY: a scalable scheme for nonlinear Boltzmann and correlation kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a time-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations. This framework advances our ability to investigate the early thermalization puzzle in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to elucidate the applicability of hydrodynamics at remarkably early stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

      <title>Transverse Energy-Energy Correlator for Vector Boson-Tagged Hadron Production in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse energy-energy correlator (TEEC) event-shape observable for back-to-back $\gamma + h$ and $Z + h$ production in both $pp$ and $pA$ collisions. Our study incorporates nuclear modifications into the transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework, with resummation up to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, for TEEC as a function of the variable $\tau = \left(1 + \cos{\phi} \right)/2$, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the vector boson and the final hadron. We analyze the nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ in $p\mathrm{Au}$ collisions at RHIC and $p\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that the TEEC observable is a sensitive probe for nuclear modifications in TMD physics. Specifically, the changes in the $\tau$-distribution shape provide insights into transverse momentum broadening effects in large nuclei, while measurements at different rapidities allow us to explore nuclear modifications in the collinear component of the TMD parton distribution functions in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general $U(1)$-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of effective field theory for dissipative fluids in flat Minkowski spacetime. We derive the most general quadratic action for hydrodynamic modes, including stochastic noise, and analyze the corresponding dispersion relations in a consistent gradient expansion. We argue that spontaneous breaking of spacetime symmetry arises in the presence of a local thermal state specified by a local timelike four-vector. We demonstrate that hydrodynamical perturbations can be identified as Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, analogous to their embedding in global $U(1)$-invariant theories. We find that frame-invariant combinations of hydrodynamic transport coefficients determine the first-order dispersion relations in the low-energy limit, making the mode analysis manifestly independent of the choice of hydrodynamic frame. Assuming local Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry and unitarity of the underlying UV theory, we show that first-order hydrodynamics is stable if the enthalpy density is positive.</description>

      <title>Can one-loop corrections to the one-gluon exchange potential adequately describe the charmed meson spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charmed meson spectrum using a constituent quark model (CQM) with one-loop corrections applied to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) potential. The study aims to understand if the modified version of our CQM sufficiently account for the charmed meson spectrum observed experimentally, without invoking exotic quark and gluon configurations such as hybrid mesons or tetraquarks. Within this model, charmed mesons' masses are computed, comparing theoretical predictions to experimental data. The results, within uncertainties, suggest that our theoretical framework generally reproduces mass splittings and level ordering observed for charmed mesons. Particularly, large discrepancies between theory and experiment found in $P$-wave states are, at least, significantly ameliorated by incorporating higher-order interaction terms. Therefore, the findings emphasize that while the traditional quark model is limited in fully describing charmed mesons, enhanced potential terms may bridge the gap with experimental observations. The study contributes a framework for predicting excited charmed meson states for future experimental validation.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of the photoproduction of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ mesons in peripheral $PbPb$ collisions at the center - of - mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is performed, considering distinct assumptions for the modeling of the nuclear photon flux, photon - nucleus cross - section, overlap function and dipole - proton scattering amplitude. The comparison of these predictions with the ALICE data is also performed. Our results indicate that a detailed analysis of the production of both mesons will be very useful to improve the description of photon - induced processes in peripheral collisions.</description>

      <title>Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes and $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) give an access to timelike gravitational form factors (GFFs) which are complementary to the spacelike ones which can be deduced from the hadronic generalized parton distributions (GPDs) measured in deep exclusive electroproduction processes. They allow to probe the GFFs of unstable baryons in the baryon octet, since the second moments of hadronic generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) lead to the timelike GFFs. These GDAs can be measured in the process $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$, in the generalized Bjorken regime where the invariant mass of the $B \bar{B}$ pair is near threshold at high energy facilities, such as BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. In this work, we investigate this process using the QCD collinear factorization framework, where the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the baryon timelike electromagnetic (EM) FFs and Compton FFs. We also provide a numerical estimate of the cross sections with a model for baryon-antibaryon GDAs. Our work provides us a possibility to extract the timelike baryon GFFs from near future experimental measurements, and these GFFs may be further used to study longstanding questions in hadronic physics such as the baryon spin decomposition and D-term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>
