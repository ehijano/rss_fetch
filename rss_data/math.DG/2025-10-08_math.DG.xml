      <title>A Conformal Co-Symplectic Structure on the Space of Pseudo-Riemannian Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical construction of the symplectic structure on the space of geodesic trajectories via Hamiltonian reduction fails in the pseudo-Riemannian setting due to a dimensional mismatch created by the null geodesics. This paper proposes a new, unified approach. We first construct the space of all geodesic trajectories $\mathcal{G}_\text{traj}$ directly as the quotient of the space of geodesics curves $\mathcal{G}_\text{curv}$ by the affine reparametrization group. The analysis of the orbits of this group action reveals a key geometric distribution. To describe this distribution globally, we introduce a canonical object, the "conformal co-symplectic structure" $\sigma$, defined by pushing forward the conformal class of the inverse $\omega^{-1}$ of the original symplectic form $\omega$. We prove that the image of this structure coincides with the geometric distribution identified previously. On the subspace of time-like and space-like geodesics, this structure is non-degenerate and defines a conformal class of symplectic forms. On the null subspace, its image is a codimension-$1$ distribution that we prove is the canonical contact structure on the space of light rays.</description>

      <title>$h$-Principles for smooth curves and knots with prescribed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that smooth curves with prescribed curvature satisfy a $C^1$-dense $h$-principle in the space of immersed curves in Euclidean space. More precisely, every $C^{\alpha \geq 2}$ curve with nonvanishing curvature in $R^{n\geq 3}$ can be $C^1$-approximated by $C^\alpha$ curves of any larger curvature, prescribed as a function of arclength. It follows that there exist $C^\infty$ knots of prescribed curvature in every isotopy class of closed curves embedded in $R^3$.</description>

      <title>On a class of almost Hermitian 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an integral identity proved by Sekigawa \cite{Sek87} on compact almost Hermitian 4-manifolds, we naturally obtain a global characterization of the class $\mathcal{AH}_1$ of almost Hermitian 4-manifolds satisfying the first Gray curvature condition from apparently weaker conditions. Then we take steps towards a classification of almost Hermitian 4-manifolds of class $\mathcal{AH}_1$, including proving a uniqueness result on 4-dimensional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Constant $k$th-mixed curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider general $k$th-mixed curvature $\mathcal{C}^{(k)}_{\alpha,\beta}$ ($\beta\neq0$) for Hermitian manifolds, which is a convex combination of the $k$th Chern Ricci curvature and holomorphic sectional curvature. We prove that any compact Hermitian surface with constant $k$th-mixed curvature is self-dual. Furthermore, we show that if a compact Hermitian surface has constant 2th-mixed curvature $c$, then the Hermitian metric must be K\"{a}hler. For the higher-dimensional case, when the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfy certain conditions, we can also obtain partial results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey paper, we analyse and compare the recent curvature estimates for three types of $4$-dimensional gradient Ricci solitons, especially between Ricci shrinkers [58] and expanders [17]. In addition, we provide some new curvature estimates for $4$-dimensional gradient steady Ricci solitons, including the sharp curvature estimate $|Rm|\le C R$ for gradient steady Ricci solitons with positive Ricci curvature (see Theorem 1.1).</description>

      <title>Integrable systems with symmetries: toric, semitoric, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an overview of the theory of integrable systems with symmetries, focusing on toric systems, semitoric systems, and their classifications via decorated polygons. We discuss certain one-parameter families of integrable systems called semitoric families, and explain how deforming systems through controlled bifurcations in such families (and their generalizations) can be used to construct explicit semitoric systems with prescribed invariants. The first part of the paper serves as a quick introduction to integrable systems for newcomers to the field, such as graduate students, while the majority of the exposition surveys recent developments and technical details that will be of interest to experts. It closes with a look at future directions, including hypersemitoric systems and complexity one integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Fiberwise Gromov-Witten theory, quantum spectra of flag bundles, and prime factorization of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the vertical quantum cohomology and quantum spectra of flag bundles, uncovering new links between the Gromov-Witten theory of homogeneous fibrations and analytic number theory. Building on previous constructions by Astashkevich and Sadov (arXiv:hep-th/9401103) and by Biswas, Das, Oh, and Paul (arXiv:2408.06616), we establish functorial and inductive properties of vertical quantum cohomology, and relate the vertical and absolute quantum spectra. We show that the degeneracy of the small vertical quantum spectrum of a Grassmann bundle - namely, the appearance of eigenvalues with unexpectedly high multiplicities - is controlled by the prime factorization of the involved ranks. This extends earlier results for Grassmannians to the relative setting and applies, in particular, to partial flag varieties viewed as total spaces of Grassmann bundles.
  We then introduce three families of double sequences that classify partial flag varieties according to distinct quantum spectral and combinatorial features. Their recursive and arithmetic behavior is studied through ordinary and Dirichlet generating functions. One of these sequences satisfies a Pascal-type recursion, allowing a precise analysis of its partial Dirichlet series, whose analytic continuation exhibits logarithmic singularities determined by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, for any fixed integer shift, the diagonal subsequences display eventual polynomial behavior, which admits a natural interpretation in terms of weighted walks on graphs. Finally, we examine the vanishing pattern of one of these sequences and derive equivalent formulations of Goldbach's conjecture.
  Overall, the paper reveals a rich correspondence between enumerative geometry, quantum spectral degeneracy, and classical problems in prime number theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove a quantum ergodic restriction (QER) theorem for real hypersurfaces $\Sigma \subset X,$ where $X$ is the Grauert tube associated with a real-analytic, compact Riemannian manifold. As an application, we obtain $h$ independent upper and lower bounds for the $L^2$ - restrictions of the FBI transform of Laplace eigenfunctions restricted to $\Sigma$ satisfying certain generic geometric conditions.</description>

      <title>Volume functions and boundary data of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress on two closely related sets of questions concerning convex co-compact hyperbolic manifolds, or convex domains in those manifolds, such as their convex core. The first set of questions is to what extent the hyperbolic metric on such a manifold is uniquely determined by either of two possible geometric data on their boundary. The second aspect is the ``volume'' associated to such a manifold, such as the renormalized volume of a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold. The relation between the two is provided by the first variation of the volume functions, which involves the two kinds of boundary data as ``conjugate'' variables.
  While progress has recently been made on some questions, others remain open. New connections have recently emerged, with physics (and in particular the AdS/CFT correspondence) as well as with probability theory (the Loewner energy).</description>

      <title>A contractible Schiffer counterexample on the half-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of a family of nontrivial smooth contractible domains on the sphere that admit Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian which are constant on the boundary. These domains are contained on the half-sphere, in stark contrast with the rigidity literature for Serrin-type problems. The proof relies on a local bifurcation argument around the family of geodesic disks centered at the north pole. We combine the use of anisotropic H\"older spaces for the functional setting with computer-assisted techniques to check the bifurcation conditions.</description>

      <title>Carr\'e du champ flow matching: better quality-generalisation tradeoff in generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching (FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds, single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the modified $J$-equation introduced by Li-Shi. We show that the solvability of the modified $J$-equation is equivalent to the coercivity of the modified $J$-functional on compact K\"ahler manifolds.

      <description>arXiv:2310.15798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a conformally variational scalar Riemannian invariant $I$, we identify a sufficient condition for a compact Riemannian manifold to admit finite regular coverings with many nonhomothetic conformal rescalings with $I$ constant. We also identify a sufficient condition for the universal cover to admit infinitely many geometrically distinct periodic conformal rescalings with $I$ constant. Using these conditions, we improve known nonuniqueness results for the $Q$-curvatures of orders two, four, and six, and establish nonuniqueness results for higher-order $Q$-curvatures and renormalized volume coefficients.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-timelike loops in signature changing semi-Riemannian manifolds with a transverse radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1983, Hartle and Hawking proposed the no-boundary proposal, suggesting that the universe has no beginning in the sense of a spacetime singularity or boundary. Nevertheless, there is an origin of time. Mathematically, this involves signature-type changing manifolds in which a Riemannian region smoothly transitions to a Lorentzian region across the hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ where time begins.
  We develop a coherent framework for signature changing manifolds with a degenerate yet smooth metric. Established Lorentzian tools and results are then adapted to this setting, and new definitions are introduced that carry unforeseen causal implications. A noteworthy consequence is the presence of locally time-reversing loops through every point on the hypersurface. Imposing global hyperbolicity on the Lorentzian region, we prove that for every point $p \in M$ there exists a pseudo-timelike loop self-intersecting at $p$. Equivalently, $M$ always admits a closed pseudo-timelike path around which the time direction reverses, preventing any consistent distinction between future- and past-directed vectors. To an observer near $\mathcal{H}$, such loops may appear as the creation of a particle-antiparticle pair at two distinct points.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth $s$-dimensional submanifold $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+c}$ and a smooth distribution $D\supset TS$ of rank $m$ along $S$, we study the following geometric Cauchy problem: to find an $m$-dimensional rank-$s$ submanifold $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+c}$ (that is, an $m$-submanifold with constant index of relative nullity $m-s$) such that $M \supset S$ and $TM |_{S} = D$. In particular, under some reasonable assumption and using a constructive approach, we show that a solution exists and is unique in a neighborhood of $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds carrying a type I imaginary generalized Killing spinor, by explicitly constructing a parallel spinor on each leaf of the canonical foliation given by the Dirac current. We also provide a class of Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds carrying a type II imaginary generalized Killing spinor, by considering spacelike hypersurfaces of Lorentzian $\text{spin}^c$ manifolds. We carry out much of the work in the setting of semi-Riemannian $\text{spin}^c$-manifolds carrying generalized Killing spinors, allowing us to draw conclusions in this setting as well. In this context, the Dirac current is not always a closed vector field. We circumvent this in even dimensions, by considering a modified Dirac current, which is closed in the cases when the original Dirac current is not. On the path to these results, we also study semi-Riemannian manifolds carrying closed and conformal vector fields.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Landsberg Finsler spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We locally classify all possible cosmological homogeneous and isotropic Landsberg-type Finsler structures, in 4-dimensions. Among them, we identify viable non-stationary Finsler spacetimes, i.e. those geometries leading to a physical causal structure and a dynamical universe. Noting that any non-stationary Landsberg metric must be actually non-Berwaldian (i.e., it should be a so-called 'unicorn'), we construct the unique Finsler, non-Berwaldian Landsberg generalization of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry.</description>

      <title>Comparison estimates on nonsmooth spaces with integrable Ricci lower bounds via localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study comparison estimates on metric measure spaces admitting a synthetic variable Ricci curvature lower bound. We obtain geometric and functional inequalities assuming that the deficit of the lower bound from a given constant is sufficiently integrable. More precisely, we extend to the nonsmooth setting the Bishop-Gromov comparison, the Myers' diameter estimate and the Cheng's comparison principle for Dirichlet eigenvalues. Our analysis relies on the localization method and on one-dimensional comparison estimates for nonsmooth weighted intervals.</description>
