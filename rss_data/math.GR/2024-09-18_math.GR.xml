      <title>On $G$-character tables for normal subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a finite group $G$. From a result due to Brauer, it can be derived that the character table of $G$ contains square submatrices which are induced by the $G$-conjugacy classes of elements in $N$ and the $G$-orbits of irreducible characters of $N$. In the present paper, we provide an alternative approach to this fact through the structure of the group algebra. We also show that such matrices are non-singular and become a useful tool to obtain information of $N$ from the character table of $G$.</description>

      <title>Conditional representation stability, classification of $*$-homomorphisms, and relative eta invariants</title>

Abstract: A quasi-representation of a group is a map from the group into a matrix algebra (or similar object) that approximately satisfies the relations needed to be a representation. Work of many people starting with Kazhdan and Voiculescu, and recently advanced by Dadarlat, Eilers-Shulman-S\o{}rensen and others, has shown that there are topological obstructions to approximating unitary quasi-representations of groups by honest representations, where `approximation' is understood to be with respect to the operator norm.
  The purpose of this paper is to explore whether approximation is possible if the known obstructions vanish, partially generalizing work of Gong-Lin and Eilers-Loring-Pedersen for the free abelian group of rank two, and the Klein bottle group. We show that this is possible, at least in a weak sense, for some `low-dimensional' groups including fundamental groups of closed surfaces, certain Baumslag-Solitar groups, free-by-cyclic groups, and many fundamental groups of three manifolds.
  The techniques used in the paper are $K$-theoretic: they have their origin in Baum-Connes-Kasparov type assembly maps, and in the Elliott program to classify $C^*$-algebras; Kasparov's bivariant KK-theory is a crucial tool. The key new technical ingredients are: a stable uniqueness theorem in the sense of Dadarlat-Eilers and Lin that works for non-exact $C^*$-algebras; and an analysis of maps on $K$-theory with finite coefficients in terms of the relative eta invariants of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. Despite the proofs going through $K$-theoretic machinery, the main theorems can be stated in elementary terms that do not need any $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Zero-sum partitions of Abelian groups and their applications to magic- and antimagic-type labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09395v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following problem has been known since the 80s. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group of order $m$ (denoted $|\Gamma|=m$), and let $t$ and $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$, be positive integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^t m_i=m-1$. Determine when $\Gamma^*=\Gamma\setminus\{0\}$, the set of non-zero elements of $\Gamma$, can be partitioned into disjoint subsets $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^{t}$ such that $|S_i|=m_i$ and $\sum_{s\in S_i}s=0$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$. Such a subset partition is called a \textit{zero-sum partition}. $|I(\Gamma)|\neq 1$, where $I(\Gamma)$ is the set of involutions in $\Gamma$, is a necessary condition for the existence of zero-sum partitions. In this paper, we show that the additional condition of $m_i\geq 4$ for every $1 \leq i \leq t$, is sufficient. Moreover, we present some applications of zero-sum partitions to magic- and antimagic-type labelings of graphs.</description>
