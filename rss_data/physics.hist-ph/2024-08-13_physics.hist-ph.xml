      <title>Galileo's Ship and the Relativity Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that the Galilean Relativity Principle, according to which the laws of classical systems are the same in all inertial frames in relative motion, has played an important role in the development of modern physics. It is also commonly believed that this principle holds the key to answering why, for example, we do not notice the orbital velocity of the Earth as we go about our day. And yet, I argue in this paper that the precise content of this principle is ambiguous: standard presentations fail to distinguish between two principles that are ultimately inequivalent, the "External Galilean Relativity Principle" (EGRP) and the "Internal Galilean Relativity Principle" (IGRP). I demonstrate that EGRP and IGRP play distinct roles in physics and that many classical systems that satisfy IGRP fail to satisfy EGRP. I further show that the Relativity Principle introduced by Einstein in 1905-which is not restricted to classical systems-also leads to two inequivalent principles. I conclude by noting that the phenomenon originally captured by Galileo's famous ship passage is much more general than contemporary discussions in the philosophy of symmetries suggest.</description>

      <title>Toward an understanding of the measurement process in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A suggestion is made for what happens to a wave function during a measurement. A sequence of interactions with the components of a measurement device is modeled with a simple stochastic process that produces the Born interpretation of quantum mechanical amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Occam's Razor and Bender and Koller's Octopus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the teaching of the discussion surrounding Bender and Koller's prominent ACL 2020 paper, "Climbing toward NLU: on meaning form, and understanding in the age of data" \cite{bender2020climbing}. We present what we understand to be the main contentions of the paper, and then recommend that the students engage with the natural counter-arguments to the claims in the paper. We attach teaching materials that we use to facilitate teaching this topic to undergraduate students.</description>
