      <title>Molecular laser cooling using serrodynes: Implementation, characterization and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important effort is currently underway to extend optical cycling and laser cooling to more molecular species. Significant challenges arise in particular when multiple nuclear spins give rise to complex, resolved hyperfine spectra, as is the case for several molecular species relevant to precision tests of fundamental symmetries. We provide a detailed introduction to the use of optical spectra generated via serrodyne waveforms to address this complexity. We discuss our experimental implementation of these serrodynes, characterize their properties, and outline procedures to find optimized sideband configurations that generate strong laser cooling forces. We demonstrate the application of these techniques to barium monofluoride molecules and explore their prospects for the cooling of other species relevant to the study of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Low-energy photoelectron structures for arbitrary ellipticity of a strong laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous attoclock experiments measuring the photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) via strong-field ionization in an elliptically polarized laser field have shown anomalously large offset angles in the nonadiabatic regime with large Keldysh parameters ($\gamma$). We investigate the process theoretically in the complete range of ellipticity ($\epsilon$) and large range of $\gamma$, employing numerical solutions of time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and nonadiabatic classical-trajectory Monte Carlo simulations matched with the under-the-barrier motion via the nonadiabatic strong field approximation. We show the formation of low-energy structures (LES) at any ellipticity value when the Keldysh parameter is sufficiently large. Three regimes of the interaction in the ($\epsilon$-$\gamma$)-space of parameters are identified via the characteristic PMD features. The significant modification of the recollision picture in the nonadiabatic regime, with so-called anomalous and hybrid slow recollisions, is shown to be behind the LES, inducing extreme nonlinear Coulomb bunching in the phase-space in the polarization plane. Our findings elucidate subtle features of the attosecond electron dynamics in strong-field ionization at extreme conditions and indicate limitations on attosecond imaging.</description>

      <title>Doppler-free Selective Reflection spectroscopy of the $6s$ $^2S_{1/2} \to 7p$ $^2P_{3/2}$ transition of Cesium using a nanofabricated vapor cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective Reflection (SR) spectroscopy of the $6s$ $^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow$ $7p$ $^2P_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition of Cesium ($\lambda~=~456$ nm) is performed for the first time using a nanometric-thin cell ($L=50 - 1500$~nm). We succesfully form narrow resonances corresponding to the $F_g = 3,4 \rightarrow F_e =2,3,4,5$ hyperfine transitions. All transitions are well spectrally resolved and the geometry of the cell allows us to obtain a strong 30 times narrowing of the Doppler width with a single beam pass. For lower thicknesses ($L &lt; 400$~nm), we observe a red shift of the \ac{SR} lines which we attribute to atom-surface interactions, and provide estimates of the $C_3$ interaction coefficient. The SR signal reaches several percent of the incident radiation up to a saturation intensity of 100 mW/cm$^2$. SR is a convenient tool for laser spectroscopy of the hyperfine structure of atoms as well as for the study of Zeeman transitions in magnetic fields. Experimental measurements are in good agreement with theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in alignment signals in cesium in ultra-weak magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in a transverse magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory, since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.</description>

      <title>Observation of Subnatural-Linewidth Biphotons In a Two-Level Atomic Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphotons and single photons with narrow bandwidths and long coherence times are essential to the realization of long-distance quantum communication (LDQC) and linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). In this Letter, we manipulate the biphoton wave functions of the spontaneous four-wave mixing in a two-level atomic ensemble with a single-laser pump scheme. Our innovative experimental approach enables the generation of biphotons with a sub-MHz bandwidth of 0.36 MHz, a record spectral brightness of $2.28\times10^7$${\rm s}^{-1}{\rm mW}^{-1}{\rm MHz}^{-1}$, and a temporally symmetric wave packet at moderate optical depth. The strong non-classical cross-correlation of the biphotons also enables the observation of heralded sub-MHz-linewidth single photons with a pronounced single-photon nature. The generation of sub-MHz-linewidth biphotons and single photons with a two-level atomic ensembles not only finds applications in quantum repeaters and large cluster states for LDQC and LOQC but also opens up the opportunity to miniaturize the biphoton or single-photon sources for chip-scale quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Noise budget of a trapped on chip cold atom Rubidium 87 clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a realisation of an on chip atomic clock using a cold cloud of Rubidium 87 atoms. This clock is based on a Ramsey interferometer with a Ramsey time around 600 ms. This is realized with large lab temperature drift during the measurement (few degrees per day) and without magnetic field shielding. We review the experimental implementation of this clock and give a full study of the known noises present in this atomic clock.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach for line detection in complex atomic emission spectra measured by high-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic spectra and structure of the open d- and f-shell elements are extremely complex, where tens of thousands of transitions between fine structure energy levels can be observed as spectral lines across the infrared and UV per species. Energy level quantum properties and transition wavenumbers of these elements underpins almost all spectroscopic plasma diagnostic investigations, with prominent demands from astronomy and fusion research. Despite their importance, these fundamental data are incomplete for many species. A major limitation for the analyses of emission spectra of the open d- and f-shell elements is the amount of time and human resource required to extract transition wavenumbers and intensities from the spectra. Here, the spectral line detection problem is approached by encoding the spectrum point-wise using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks, where transition wavenumber positions are decoded by a fully connected neural network. The model was trained using simulated atomic spectra and evaluated against experimental Fourier transform spectra of Ni ($Z=28$) covering 1800-70,000 cm$^{-1}$ (5555-143 nm) and Nd ($Z=60$) covering 25,369-32,485 cm$^{-1}$ (394-308 nm), measured under a variety of experimental set-ups. Improvements over conventional methods in line detection were evident, particularly for spectral lines that are noisy, blended, and/or distorted by instrumental spectral resolution-limited ringing. In evaluating model performance, a brief energy level analysis of Ni II using lines newly detected by the neural networks has led to the confident identification of two Ni II levels, $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [2]_{3/2}$ at 134,261.8946 $\pm$ 0.0081 cm$^{-1}$ and $3\text{d}^8$$(^3\text{F}_4)6\text{f} [1]_{3/2}$ at 134,249.5264 $\pm$ 0.0054 cm$^{-1}$, previously concluded to be unidentifiable using previously analysed Ni spectra.</description>

      <title>Phase-Amplitude Representation of Continuum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical method of solving the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for the regular and irregular continuum states using the phase-amplitude representation is presented. Our solution acquires the correct Dirac-delta normalization by wisely enforcing the amplitude and phase boundary values. Our numerical test involving point-wise relative errors with the known Coulomb functions shows that the present method approximates both the regular and irregular wavefunctions with similar, excellent accuracy. This is done by using new basis polynomials that, among other advantages, can elegantly enforce the derivative continuity of any order. The current phase-amplitude method is implemented here to study the continuum states of Coulomb-screened potentials. We discovered that, during the parametric transition from a Hydrogen atom to the Yukawa potential, the electronic density at the origin exhibits surprising oscillation -- a phenomenon apparently unique to the continuum states.</description>

      <title>Exact Stark analytical function for H{\alpha} line based on the FFM Model related with plasma parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Emission Spectroscopy is a widely used technique for plasma diagnosis, with particular interest in hydrogen atomic emission due to its prevalence in plasmas. However, accurately determining plasma parameters like electron density, electron temperature, and gas temperature starting from the experimental profiles remains a challenge. This paper introduces a comprehensive model for Stark broadening of the H{\alpha} line in a wide range of plasma conditions, addressing the limitations of existing analytical expressions for line shapes. The proposed model encompasses the full splitting of the transition into fifteen Lorentzian profiles and electric micro-field fluctuations surrounding the emitting atoms due to collisions with charged particles. Starting from accurate spectral data obtained from realistic computer simulations, fitting parameters of the model, have been obtained by using an optimization method based on a genetic algorithm. The set of parameters of the model are reported for a wide range of plasma conditions. The behavior of these parameters is analyzed to understand their dependence in terms of the electron density and temperature and gas density of the plasma. The model parameters here obtained constitute a useful tool in plasma diagnosis to obtaining the values of the physical parameters of the plasma starting from the experimental profiles.</description>

      <title>Optical Nuclear Electric Resonance as Single Qubit Gate for Trapped Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$ $^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$ 5s5p $^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be surpassed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Superheterodyne Rydberg S-band receiver with a multi-tone local oscillator based on an atomic transition loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Schawlow-Townes Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of a feedback oscillators realized by a phase-insensitive amplifier in positive feedback, where either the amplifier or the feedback element may determine the oscillator's linewidth. The spectral purity of the output of such a device originates from basic demands of quantum mechanics and causality. The resulting expression generalizes the Schawlow-Townes limit, which is itself one component of a standard quantum limit for feedback oscillators. Recently realized bad-cavity oscillators such as super-radiant lasers and solid-state masers can saturate this generalized Schawlow-Townes limit. This limit can be surpassed through appropriate quantum engineering: for example by atomic spin squeezing in a super-radiant laser.</description>

      <title>A High-Power Clock Laser Spectrally Tailored for High-Fidelity Quantum State Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly frequency-stable lasers are a ubiquitous tool for optical frequency metrology, precision interferometry, and quantum information science. While making a universally applicable laser is unrealistic, spectral noise can be tailored for specific applications. Here we report a high-power clock laser with minimized high-frequency noise, together with long-term instability of $3.5 \times 10^{-17}$ at one to thousands of seconds. The laser frequency noise is precisely characterized with atom-based spectral analysis that employs a pulse sequence designed to suppress sensitivity to intensity noise. This method provides universally applicable tunability of the spectral response and analysis of quantum sensors over a wide frequency range. With the optimized laser system characterized by this technique, we achieve an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity of up to $F_1^2 = 0.99964(3)$ when simultaneously driving 3000 optical qubits with a homogeneous Rabi frequency ranging from 10 Hz to $\sim$ 1 kHz. This result represents the highest single optical-qubit gate fidelity for large number of atoms.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an atom interferometer measurement protocol compatible with operation on a dynamic platform. Our method employs two open interferometers, derived from the same atomic source, with different interrogation times to eliminate initial velocity dependence while retaining precision, accuracy, and long term stability. We validate the protocol by measuring gravitational tides, achieving a precision of 4.5 {\mu}Gal in 2000 runs (6.7 h), marking the first demonstration of inertial quantity measurement with open atom interferometry that achieves long-term phase stability.</description>

      <title>A universal neutral-atom quantum computer with individual optical addressing and non-destructive readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-13]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation may greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single-qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with 0.9(3)% loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure a state-of-the-art CZ fidelity of 99.73(3)% when excluding atom-loss events, which may be mitigated through erasure conversion. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</description>

      <title>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as a light source. Time-modulating driving stimulates it to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to those of other generation methods for propagating states, suggesting a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Variational simulation of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model on a neutral atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using the Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on a neutral atom quantum computer. We test the ground-state energy of spin systems with up to 15 spins. Two different encoding schemes are used: an individual spin encoding where each spin is represented by one qubit, and an efficient Gray code encoding scheme which only requires a number of qubits that scales with the logarithm of the number of spins. This more efficient encoding, together with zero noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.</description>
