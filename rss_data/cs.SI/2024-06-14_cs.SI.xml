      <title>Predicting Cascading Failures with a Hyperparametric Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study cascading failures in power grids through the lens of information diffusion models. Similar to the spread of rumors or influence in an online social network, it has been observed that failures (outages) in a power grid can spread contagiously, driven by viral spread mechanisms. We employ a stochastic diffusion model that is Markovian (memoryless) and local (the activation of one node, i.e., transmission line, can only be caused by its neighbors). Our model integrates viral diffusion principles with physics-based concepts, by correlating the diffusion weights (contagion probabilities between transmission lines) with the hyperparametric Information Cascades (IC) model. We show that this diffusion model can be learned from traces of cascading failures, enabling accurate modeling and prediction of failure propagation. This approach facilitates actionable information through well-understood and efficient graph analysis methods and graph diffusion simulations. Furthermore, by leveraging the hyperparametric model, we can predict diffusion and mitigate the risks of cascading failures even in unseen grid configurations, whereas existing methods falter due to a lack of training data. Extensive experiments based on a benchmark power grid and simulations therein show that our approach effectively captures the failure diffusion phenomena and guides decisions to strengthen the grid, reducing the risk of large-scale cascading failures. Additionally, we characterize our model's sample complexity, improving upon the existing bound.</description>

      <title>LGB: Language Model and Graph Neural Network-Driven Social Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious social bots achieve their malicious purposes by spreading misinformation and inciting social public opinion, seriously endangering social security, making their detection a critical concern. Recently, graph-based bot detection methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, our research finds many isolated and poorly linked nodes in social networks, as shown in Fig.1, which graph-based methods cannot effectively detect. To address this problem, our research focuses on effectively utilizing node semantics and network structure to jointly detect sparsely linked nodes. Given the excellent performance of language models (LMs) in natural language understanding (NLU), we propose a novel social bot detection framework LGB, which consists of two main components: language model (LM) and graph neural network (GNN). Specifically, the social account information is first extracted into unified user textual sequences, which is then used to perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the language model to improve its ability to understand social account semantics. Next, the semantically enriched node representation is fed into the pre-trained GNN to further enhance the node representation by aggregating information from neighbors. Finally, LGB fuses the information from both modalities to improve the detection performance of sparsely linked nodes. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LGB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models by up to 10.95%. LGB is already online: https://botdetection.aminer.cn/robotmain.</description>

      <title>Heuristics for Influence Maximization with Tiered Influence and Activation thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information flows among the people while they communicate through social media websites. Due to the dependency on digital media, a person shares important information or regular updates with friends and family. The set of persons on social media forms a social network. Influence Maximization (IM) is a known problem in social networks. In social networks, information flows from one person to another using an underlying diffusion model. There are two fundamental diffusion models: the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) and the Linear Threshold Model (LTM). In this paper, we study a variant of the IM problem called Minimum Influential Seeds (MINFS) problem proposed by Qiang et al.[16]. It generalizes the classical IM problem with LTM as the diffusion model. Compared to IM, this variant has additional parameters: the influence threshold for each node and the propagation range. The propagation range is a positive integer that specifies how far the information can propagate from a node. A node on the network is not immediately influenced until it receives the same information from enough number of neighbors (influence threshold). Similarly, any node does not forward information until it receives the same information from a sufficient number of neighbors (activation threshold). Once a node becomes activated, it tries to activate or influence its neighbors. The MINFS problem aims to select the minimum number of initial spreader nodes such that all nodes of the graph are influenced. In this paper, we extend the study of the MINFS problem. We propose heuristics that construct seed sets based on the average degree of non-activated nodes, closest first, and backbone-based heaviest path.</description>

      <title>PSN: Persian Social Norms Dataset for Cross-Cultural AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datasets capturing cultural norms are essential for developing globally aware AI systems. We present Persian Social Norms (PSN) a novel dataset of over 1.7k Persian social norms, including environments, contexts, and cultural labels, alongside English translations. Leveraging large language models and prompt-engineering techniques, we generated potential norms that were reviewed by native speakers for quality and ethical compliance. As the first Persian dataset of its kind, this resource enables computational modeling of norm adaptation, a crucial challenge for cross-cultural AI informed by diverse cultural perspectives.</description>

      <title>Effects of Antivaccine Tweets on COVID-19 Vaccinations, Cases, and Deaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccines were critical in reducing hospitalizations and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their wide availability in the United States, 62% of Americans chose not to be vaccinated during 2021. While online misinformation about COVID-19 is correlated to vaccine hesitancy, little prior work has explored a causal link between real-world exposure to antivaccine content and vaccine uptake. Here we present a compartmental epidemic model that includes vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, and exposure to antivaccine content. We fit the model to observational data to determine that a geographical pattern of exposure to online antivaccine content across US counties is responsible for a pattern of reduced vaccine uptake in the same counties. We find that exposure to antivaccine content on Twitter caused about 750,000 people to refuse vaccination between February and August 2021 in the US, resulting in at least 29,000 additional cases and 430 additional deaths. This work provides a methodology for linking online speech to offline epidemic outcomes. Our findings should inform social media moderation policy as well as public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Empirical Networks are Sparse: Enhancing Multi-Edge Models with Zero-Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks are sparse. As we show in this article, even when a large number of interactions is observed most node pairs remain disconnected. We demonstrate that classical multi-edge network models, such as the $G(N,p)$, configuration models, and stochastic block models, fail to accurately capture this phenomenon. To mitigate this issue, zero-inflation must be integrated into these traditional models. Through zero-inflation, we incorporate a mechanism that accounts for the excess number of zeroes (disconnected pairs) observed in empirical data. By performing an analysis on all the datasets from the Sociopatterns repository, we illustrate how zero-inflated models more accurately reflect the sparsity and heavy-tailed edge count distributions observed in empirical data. Our findings underscore that failing to account for these ubiquitous properties in real-world networks inadvertently leads to biased models which do not accurately represent complex systems and their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Frameworks, Modeling and Simulations of Misinformation and Disinformation: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant challenge in today's digital landscape. That is why several methods and tools are proposed to analyze and understand these phenomena from a scientific perspective. To assess how the mis/disinformation is being conceptualized and evaluated in the literature, this paper surveys the existing frameworks, models and simulations of mis/disinformation dynamics by performing a systematic literature review up to 2023. After applying the PRISMA methodology, 57 research papers are inspected to determine (1) the terminology and definitions of mis/disinformation, (2) the methods used to represent mis/disinformation, (3) the primary purpose beyond modeling and simulating mis/disinformation, (4) the context where the mis/disinformation is studied, and (5) the validation of the proposed methods for understanding mis/disinformation.
  The main findings reveal a consistent essence definition of misinformation and disinformation across studies, with intent as the key distinguishing factor. Research predominantly uses social frameworks, epidemiological models, and belief updating simulations. These studies aim to estimate the effectiveness of mis/disinformation, primarily in health and politics. The preferred validation strategy is to compare methods with real-world data and statistics. Finally, this paper identifies current trends and open challenges in the mis/disinformation research field, providing recommendations for future work agenda.</description>

      <title>Limiting behaviour of Branching Processes and Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The literature considers multi-type Markov branching processes (BPs), where the offspring distribution depends only on the living (current) population. We analyse the total-current population-dependent BPs where the offspring distribution can also depend on the total (dead and living) population. Such a generalization is inspired by the need to accurately model content propagation over online social networks (OSNs). The key question investigated is the time-asymptotic proportion of the populations, which translates to the proportional visibility of the posts on the OSN. We provide the answer using a stochastic approximation (SA) technique, which has not been used in the existing BP literature. The analysis is derived using a non-trivial autonomous measurable ODE. Interestingly, we prove the possibility of a new limiting behaviour for the stochastic trajectory, named as hovering around. Such a result is not just new to the theory of BPs but also to the SA based literature.
  Later, we explore three new variants of BPs: (i) any living individual of a population can attack and acquire the living individuals of the other population, in addition to producing its offspring; (ii) the individuals can die due to abnormal circumstances, and not just at the completion of their lifetimes; (iii) the expected number of offspring decreases as the total-population increases, leading to the saturation of the total-population.
  Such variants aid in analysing unexplored aspects of content propagation over OSNs: (i) competition in advertisement posts for similar products; (ii) controlling fake-post propagation, while not affecting the sharing of real-post; (iii) impact of re-forwarding the posts. We also designed and analysed a participation (mean-field) game where the OSN lures the users with a reward-based scheme to provide their opinion about the actuality of the post (fake or real).</description>

      <title>A Sublinear Algorithm for Approximate Shortest Paths in Large Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing distances and finding shortest paths in massive real-world networks is a fundamental algorithmic task in network analysis. There are two main approaches to solving this task. On one hand are traversal-based algorithms like bidirectional breadth-first search (BiBFS) with no preprocessing step and slow individual distance inquiries. On the other hand are indexing-based approaches, which maintain a large index. This allows for answering individual inquiries very fast; however, index creation is prohibitively expensive. We seek to bridge these two extremes: quickly answer distance inquiries without the need for costly preprocessing.
  In this work, we propose a new algorithm and data structure, WormHole, for approximate shortest path computations. WormHole leverages structural properties of social networks to build a sublinearly sized index, drawing upon the explicit core-periphery decomposition of Ben-Eliezer et al. Empirically, the preprocessing time of WormHole improves upon index-based solutions by orders of magnitude, and individual inquiries are consistently much faster than in BiBFS. The acceleration comes at the cost of a minor accuracy trade-off. Nonetheless, our empirical evidence demonstrates that WormHole accurately answers essentially all inquiries within a maximum additive error of 2. We complement these empirical results with provable theoretical guarantees, showing that WormHole requires $n^{o(1)}$ node queries per distance inquiry in random power-law networks. In contrast, any approach without a preprocessing step requires $n^{\Omega(1)}$ queries for the same task.
  WormHole does not require reading the whole graph. Unlike the vast majority of index-based algorithms, it returns paths, not just distances. For faster inquiry times, it can be combined effectively with other index-based solutions, by running them only on the sublinear core.</description>

      <title>ESND: An Embedding-based Framework for Signed Network Dismantling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network dismantling aims to maximize the disintegration of a network by removing a specific set of nodes or edges and is applied to various tasks in diverse domains, such as cracking down on crime organizations, delaying the propagation of rumors, and blocking the transmission of viruses. Most of the current network dismantling methods are tailored for unsigned networks, which only consider the connection between nodes without evaluating the nature of the relationships, such as friendship/hostility, enhancing/repressing, and trust/distrust. We here propose an embedding-based algorithm, namely ESND, to solve the signed network dismantling problem. The algorithm generally iterates the following four steps, i.e., giant component detection, network embedding, node clustering, and removal node selection. To illustrate the efficacy and stability of ESND, we conduct extensive experiments on six signed network datasets as well as null models, and compare the performance of our method with baselines. Experimental results consistently show that the proposed ESND is superior to the baselines and displays stable performance with the change in the network structure. Additionally, we examine the impact of sign proportions on network robustness via ESND, observing that networks with a high ratio of negative edges are generally easier to dismantle than networks with high positive edges.</description>

      <title>Topic Shifts as a Proxy for Assessing Politicization in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Politicization is a social phenomenon studied by political science characterized by the extent to which ideas and facts are given a political tone. A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms. In this work, we propose a computational method for assessing politicization in online conversations based on topic shifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in online conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective. Instead, we learn from a seed of political keywords and use Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning to detect political comments in reaction to non-political news articles posted on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. Our findings indicate that all platforms show evidence of politicization as discussion around topics adjacent to politics such as economy, crime and drugs tend to shift to politics. Even the least politicized topics had the rate in which their topics shift to politics increased in the lead up to the elections and after other political events in Brazil -- an evidence of politicization.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of cognition based on oscillatory and reinforcement processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building mathematical models of brains is difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem. One potential starting point is through basal cognition, which give abstract representation of a range of organisms without central nervous systems, including fungi, slime moulds and bacteria. We propose one such model, demonstrating how a combination of oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes can be used to couple resources in an efficient manner, mimicking the way these organisms function. A key ingredient in our model, not found in previous basal cognition models, is that we explicitly model oscillations in the number of particles (i.e. the nutrients, chemical signals or similar, which make up the biological system) and the flow of these particles within the modelled organisms. Using this approach, we find that our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We further demonstrate that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. In the context of these findings, we discuss connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, how oscillations might contribute to self-organised problem-solving by these organisms.</description>
