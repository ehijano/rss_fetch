      <title>The Role of Intangible Investment in Predicting Stock Returns: Six Decades of Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an intangible intensity factor that is orthogonal to the Fama--French factors, we compare the role of intangible investment in predicting stock returns over the periods 1963--1992 and 1993--2022. For 1963--1992, intangible investment is weak in predicting stock returns, but for 1993--2022, the predictive power of intangible investment becomes very strong. Intangible investment has a significant impact not only on the MTB ratio (Fama--French high minus low [HML] factor) but also on operating profitability (OP) (Fama--French robust minus weak [RMW] factor) when forecasting stock returns from 1993 to 2022. For intangible asset-intensive firms, intangible investment is the main predictor of stock returns, rather than MTB ratio and profitability. Our evidence suggests that intangible investment has become an important factor in explaining stock returns over time, independent of other factors such as profitability and MTB ratio.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for BSDEs with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the deep solver by Han, Jentzen, E (2018) to the case of forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process. We successfully apply our algorithm to option pricing problems in low and high dimension and discuss the applicability in the context of counterparty credit risk.</description>
