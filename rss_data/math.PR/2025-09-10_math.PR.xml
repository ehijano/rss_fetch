      <title>Axioms for the Measure of Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has not been an established mathematical measure of evidence. Some Bayesians have argued that probability can be an objectively correct measure of ``rational degrees of belief,'' which we do not distinguish from evidence. However, support for the objectivist view has been limited due to the lack of a general method for assigning probabilities to evidence (belief) de novo. The standard axioms of Kolmogorov and Cox solve only the calculation problem, specifying how probabilities can be calculated from other probabilities. They do not solve the measurement problem of how to determine the uniquely correct value of P(A) given only A. The prototypical solution has always been Laplace's principle of indifference, which assigns equal (uniform) probabilities to all possibilities. However, uniformity is well known to be inconsistent with the standard axioms when there are infinite possibilities. Here we introduce new axioms that resolve this inconsistency. We first show that all measures must ultimately be based on uniformity, and that uniformity is inevitable if all propositions are adequately defined. We then reconcile uniformity with infinite possibilities by using hyperrational numbers, so that an infinite sum of infinitesimal probabilities can equal one. Our axioms thereby provide a general and relatively simple solution to the measurement problem. We discuss a variety of conceptual obstacles that have made this solution difficult to recognize.</description>

      <title>Counter-example to continuity of measure in uncountable unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuity of measure asserts that the measure of the union of an increasing sequence of sets is equal to the supremum of the measures of those sets. We provide counter examples in the case of uncountable unions. We construct the first counter example on the ordinal numbers, and we show that counterexamples also exist in the reals if we assume the continuum hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Generalized variational principle for an accelerated pressureless gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a discrete model of sticky particles initially subjected to acceleration. We propose a novel generalized variational principle for characterizing clusters (i.e., particle agglomerations) under decreasing acceleration function. This accelerated particle model is usually employed to solve a system of forced (inhomogeneous) pressureless gas equations. The momentum conservation law requires evaluating the force acting on the gas particles. Here, we present a new solution to this system of equations, based on the distribution of mass over particle velocities and on the acceleration function.</description>

      <title>On necessary conditions of rational-infinite divisibility for distributions with non-zero discrete parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the new class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ of rational-infinitely (or quasi-infinitely) divisible distribution functions on the real line. By definition, $F\in \boldsymbol{Q}$ if there are some infinitely divisible distribution functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $F_1=F*F_2$, where ``$*$'' is the convolution. The characteristic function of such $F$ admits the L\'evy--Khintchine-type representation with a ``signed spectral measure''. The class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is a significant extension of the family of infinitely divisible distribution functions and it have already found some applications in several areas. So there is an active interest in this class. In particular, a lot of results have recently appeared on the problem of belonging to the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ in terms of characteristic functions. In the paper, we continue this series of results by proposing two necessary conditions for distribution functions from $\boldsymbol{Q}$ with non-zero discrete parts. Namely, the characteristic functions of such a distribution function and its discrete part are always separated from zero.</description>

      <title>Optimal Thresholds for Monotone Non-Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $[q] = \{0,1,\ldots,q-1\}$, let $\Delta[q]$ denote the simplex of probability measures on $[q]$, and let $\lambda$ denote the Lebesgue measure. We prove that for any symmetric monotone function $f \colon[q]^n \to [q]$ and any $a \in [q]$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
  \lambda(\{\mu \in \Delta[q]\;\vert\;\mathbf{Pr}_{x\sim\mu^{\otimes n}}[f(x)=a] \in (\varepsilon,1-\varepsilon)\}) = O(1/\log n)\textrm{.}
  \end{equation*} We also show that this bound is tight. This improves Kalai and Mossel's previous bound of $O(\log \log n/\log n)$ and answers their question completely.</description>

      <title>On the edge eigenvalues of sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the edge eigenvalues of random geometric graphs (RGGs) generated by multivariate Gaussian samples in the sparse regime under a broad class of distance metrics. Previous work on edge eigenvalues under related setups has relied on methods based on integral operators or the Courant-Fischer min-max principle with interpolation. However, these approaches typically require either a dense regime or sampling distributions that are compactly supported and non-vanishing, and therefore cannot be generalized to our setting. We introduce a two-step smoothing-matching argument. First, we construct a smoothed empirical operator from the given RGG. We then match its edge eigenvalues to those of a continuum limit operator via a counting argument. We show that, after proper normalization, the first few nontrivial edge eigenvalues of the RGG converge with high probability to those of a differential operator, which can be computed explicitly through a simple second-order linear partial differential equation. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results on the edge eigenvalues of RGGs generated from samples with unbounded support and vanishing density functions.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of averaged limit shapes of random multiple Young diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The branching rule for the tower of wreath products of a finite group by the symmetric groups induces a stochastic process on the set of multiple Young diagrams through random transitions of boxes of the diagrams between one another. We observe dynamical multiple averaged limit shapes resulting from appropriate scaling limits, either diffusive or non-diffusive. We describe time evolution of the macroscopic multiple averaged limit shapes in terms of Voiculescu's $R$-transforms and free L\'evy measures of corresponding Kerov transition measures. Our microscopic dynamics admits non-exponential pausing time distributions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion: Analysis in time and frequency domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel construction of the two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (2D fBm) with dependent components. Unlike similar models discussed in the literature, our approach uniquely accommodates the full range of model parameters and explicitly incorporates cross-dependencies and anisotropic scaling through a matrix-valued Hurst operator. We thoroughly analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed causal and well-balanced 2D fBm versions, deriving their auto- and cross-covariance structures in both time and frequency domains. In particular, we present the power spectral density of these processes and their increments. Our analytical findings are validated with numerical simulations. This work provides a comprehensive framework for modeling anomalous diffusion phenomena in multidimensional systems where component interdependencies are crucial.</description>

      <title>Fefferman multiplier theorem for Hardy martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known theorem due to Fefferman provides a characterization of Fourier multipliers from $H^1(\mathbb{T})$ to $\ell^1$, i.e. sequences $\left(\lambda_n\right)_{n=0}^\infty$ such that \[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left|\lambda_n \widehat{f}(n)\right|\lesssim \|f\|_{L^1(\mathbb{T})},\] where $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \widehat{f}(n)e^{inx}$. We extend it to the space $H^1\left(\mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N}\right)$ of Hardy martingales, i.e. the subspace of $L^1$ on the countable product $\mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N}$ consisting of all $f$ such that the differences $\Delta_nf=f_{n}-f_{n-1}$ of the martingale wrt the standard filtration generated by $f$ satisfy \[\left(t\mapsto \Delta_n f\left(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1},t\right)\right)\in H^1(\mathbb{T}). \] The key ingredient is a theorem due to P. F. X. M\"uller stating that the classical Davis-Garsia decomposition \[\mathbb{E} \left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left|\Delta_n f\right|^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}\simeq \inf_{f=g+h} \mathbb{E}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left|\Delta_n g\right|+ \mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \mathbb{E}\left(\left|\Delta_n f\right|^2\mid \mathcal{F}_{n-1}\right)\right)^\frac{1}{2}\] may be done within the space of Hardy martingales.</description>

      <title>Permuton and local limits for the Luce model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic properties of permutations drawn from the Luce model, a natural probabilistic framework in which permutations are generated sequentially by sampling without replacement, with selection probabilities proportional to prescribed positive weights. These permutations arise in applications such as ranking models, the Tsetlin library, and related Markov processes. Under minimal assumptions on the weights, we establish a permuton limit theorem describing the global behavior of Luce-distributed permutations and derive an explicit density of the limiting permuton. We further compute limiting pattern densities and analyze the differences between exact Luce permutations and their permuton approximations. We also study the local convergence of these permutations, proving a quenched Benjamini--Schramm limit and a central limit theorem for consecutive pattern occurrences. Finally, we prove a central limit theorem for the number of inversions.</description>

      <title>A Note on the failure of temporal regularity for stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions to linear parabolic SPDEs of the form \[ \mathrm{d} u(t) + A u(t)\, \mathrm{d} t = g(t)\, \mathrm{d} \beta, \qquad u(0)=0, \] where $A$ is a positive, invertible, and self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $X$, $\beta$ is a one-dimensional Brownian motion, and $g(t)\equiv x\in X$. We show that, for all $\alpha\in [0,\frac{1}{2}),$ \[ u\in L^2(\Omega;W^{\alpha,2}(0,T;\mathsf{D}(A^{1/2}))) \quad \text{ if and only if }\quad x\in \mathsf{D}(A^{\alpha}). \] In particular, there is a lack of persistence of temporal regularity from the diffusion coefficient $g$ to the solution, and additional spatial regularity is required to improve time regularity. This provides a counterexample to a conjectured time-regularity property for monotone stochastic evolution equations posed in D. Breit and M. Hofmanov\'a in [C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris 354 (2016), 33-37].</description>

      <title>Expected Signature Kernels for L\'evy Rough Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expected signature kernel arises in statistical learning tasks as a similarity measure of probability measures on path space. Computing this kernel for known classes of stochastic processes is an important problem that, in particular, can help reduce computational costs. Building on the representation of the expected signature of (inhomogeneous) L\'evy processes with absolutely continuous characteristics as the development of an absolutely continuous path in the extended tensor algebra [F.-H.-Tapia, Forum of Mathematics: Sigma (2022), "Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions"], we extend the arguments developed for smooth rough paths in [Lemercier-Lyons-Salvi, "Log-PDE Methods for Rough Signature Kernels"] to derive a PDE system for the expected signature of inhomogeneous L\'evy processes. As a specific example, we see that the expected signature kernel of Gaussian martingales satisfies a Goursat PDE.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Regularity Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07948v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of regularity structures [Hai14] to allow processes belonging to locally $m$-convex topological algebras. This extension includes processes in the locally $C^{*}$-algebras of [CHP25] used to localise singular stochastic partial differential equations involving fermions, as well as processes in Banach algebras such as infinite-dimensional semicircular\circular Brownian motion, and more generally the $q$-Gaussians of [BS91, BKS97, Bo\.z99].
  A new challenge we encounter in the $q$-Gaussian setting with $q \in (-1,1)$ are noncommutative renormalisation estimates where we must estimate operators in homogeneous $q$-Gaussian chaoses with arbitrary operator insertions. We introduce a new Banach algebra norm on $q$-Gaussian operators that allows us to control such insertions; we believe this construction could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a diffusion in a Gaussian random environment that is white in time and study the large-scale behavior of the quenched density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We show that under diffusive rescaling, the fluctuations of the density converge to a Gaussian limit, described by an additive stochastic heat equation. In the case where the environment is divergence-free, our result can be interpreted as computing the scaling limit of the first-order correction to the quenched Central Limit Theorem.</description>

      <title>Zero-Freeness is All You Need: A Weitz-Type FPTAS for the Entire Lee-Yang Zero-Free Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Weitz-type FPTAS for the ferromagnetic Ising model across the entire Lee-Yang zero-free region, without relying on the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property. Our algorithm is Weitz-type for two reasons. First, it expresses the partition function as a telescoping product of ratios, with the key being to approximate each ratio. Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk tree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient approximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we approximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal probability of a vertex's spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.
  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we indeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in turn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first SSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. We prove LDC using a new division relation, and remarkably, such relations hold quite universally. As a result, we establish LDC for a variety of models. Combined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new SSM results for them. Our work suggests that both Weitz-type FPTASes and SSM can be derived from zero-freeness, while zero-freeness alone suffices for Weitz-type FPTASes, SSM additionally requires LDC, a combinatorial property independent of zero-freeness.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Theorems for Kannan and Chatterjea-type Mappings in Probabilistic Cone Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes novel fixed point theorems for Kannan-type and Chatterjea-type mappings in probabilistic cone metric spaces. By integrating probabilistic distance functions with cone-valued structures, we generalize classical fixed point results to settings with inherent uncertainty. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of probabilistic metrics and the order structure of cones to develop contraction conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of fixed points. Applications include stochastic processes, random operators, and uncertainty modeling in functional equations. The results significantly extend the scope of fixed point theory in probabilistic analysis and its applications</description>

      <title>A Baseline $T\log^2 T$ Upper Bound for KL-Regularized Prime--Zero Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that $\mathsf{OT}_\eta(T)\ll T\log^2 T$ unconditionally via a band-limited test scheme with Fej\'er averaging. The approach normalizes $\|\widehat f\|_1=\Theta(T^{-1})$ to ensure $\|h\|_1\asymp T$ and $\|\widehat h\|_1\ll 1$, and applies an $L^1$-controlled smoothed explicit formula to bound the error terms. As a result, the prime--zero optimal transport distance admits the baseline $T\log^2 T$ upper bound without additional assumptions.</description>

      <title>A set of master variables for the two-star random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such 'master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of 'large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>

      <title>City Sampling for Citizens' Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In citizens' assemblies, a group of constituents is randomly selected to weigh in on policy issues. We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring equal selection probability for constituents ex ante.
  We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain $q$-Wasserstein convergence rates in the invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic flows, where $q\ge1$ depends on the degree of nonuniformity. Utilizing a martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly expanding semiflows, we extend techniques from the discrete-time setting to the continuous-time case. Our results apply to uniformly hyperbolic (Axiom A) flows, nonuniformly hyperbolic flows that can be modelled by suspensions over Young towers with exponential tails (such as dispersing billiard flows and the classical Lorenz attractor), and intermittent solenoidal flows.</description>

      <title>Mean field control with absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a mean field control problem in which particles are absorbed when they reach the boundary of a smooth domain. The value of the N-particle problem is described by a hierarchy of Hamilton-Jacobi equations which are coupled through their boundary conditions. The value function of the limiting problem; meanwhile, solves a Hamilton-Jacobi equation set on the space of sub-probability measures on the smooth domain, i.e. the space of non-negative measures with total mass at most one. Our main contributions are (i) to establish a comparison principle for this novel infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation and (ii) to prove that the value of the N-particle problem converges in a suitable sense towards the value of the limiting problem as N tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Convergences of looptrees coded by excursions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to study convergences of looptrees, we construct continuum trees and looptrees from real-valued c\`adl\`ag functions without negative jumps called excursions. We then provide a toolbox to manipulate the two resulting codings of metric spaces by excursions and we formalize the principle that jumps correspond to loops and that continuous growths correspond to branches. Combining these codings creates new metric spaces from excursions that we call vernation trees. They consist of a collection of loops and trees glued along a tree structure so that they unify trees and looptrees. We also propose a topological definition for vernation trees, which yields what we argue to be the right space to study convergences of looptrees. However, those first codings lack some functional continuity, so we adjust them. We thus obtain several limit theorems. Finally, we present some probabilistic applications, such as proving an invariance principle for random discrete looptrees.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Schensted row insertion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic probabilistic phenomena arising from the application of the Schensted row insertion algorithm, a key component of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence, to random inputs. Our analysis centers on a random tableau $T$ with a given shape $\lambda$, which may itself be random or deterministic. We examine the stochastic properties of the position of the new box created when inserting a deterministic entry into $T$. Specifically, we focus on the fluctuations of this position around its expected value as the size of the Young diagram $\lambda$ approaches infinity. Our findings reveal that these fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian, with the mean and variance expressed in terms of Kerov's transition measure of the diagram $\lambda$. An important application of this analysis is the RSK algorithm applied to a finite, long sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables. While there remains a gap in the reasoning for this case, we present an explicit conjecture regarding its behavior.</description>

      <title>Maximally-stable Local Optima in Random Graphs and Spin Glasses: Phase Transitions and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $h$-stable local optima of Ising spin glass models, defined as spin configurations such that for nearly all of the spins, flipping their values results in increasing energy by at least a given amount $h$. Spins satisfying this condition are referred to as $h$-stable spins for that configuration. Similarly, we consider a very related notion of $h$-friendly partitions of a graph. These are defined as bi-partitionings such that for most nodes, the normalized number of neighbors within the node's partition exceed the normalized number of neighbors outside the partition by a certain amount $h$. For spin glasses as well as sparse and dense random graphs, while restricting to bisections, we prove the existence of a phase transition for the normalized energy level $h$ around a universal value $h^*$. For $h$ below the phase transition value $h^*$, bisections exist where the number of spins (nodes) which are not $h$-stable (not $h$-friendly) is sublinear. Above the phase transition level $h^*$ the smallest number of spins that are not $h$-stable (not $h$-friendly) is linear. This confirms a conjecture from Behrens et al. (2022). Our results also allow the characterization of possible energy values of stable local optima for varying $h$. In particular, for $h=0$, this rigorously proves seminal results in statistical physics regarding the so-called metastable states, such as in the work of Bray and Moore (1981). Our results extend a recent proof of the so-called Friendly Partition Conjecture in Ferber et al. (2022) from the case $h=0$ to the case when $h$ takes general values. Our proofs are obtained by analyzing the model on sparse random graphs and adopting Lindeberg's type universality method to lift the results from sparse to dense graphs and spin systems.</description>

      <title>The Horton-Strahler number of Galton-Watson trees with possibly infinite variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Horton-Strahler number, also known as the register function, provides a tool for quantifying the branching complexity of a rooted tree. We consider the Horton-Strahler number of critical Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have size $n$ and whose offspring distribution is in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law with $\alpha\in [1, 2]$. We give tail estimates and when $\alpha\neq 1$, we prove that it grows as $\frac{1}{\alpha}\log_{\alpha/(\alpha-1)} n$ in probability. This extends the result in Brandenberger, Devroye \&amp; Reddad [6] dealing with the finite variance case for which $\alpha=2$. We also characterize the cases where $\alpha=1$, namely the spectrally positive Cauchy regime, which exhibits more complex behaviors. Our proofs are new and probabilistic; they relate the Horton-Strahler number with other shape parameters such as the height or largest degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Horton-Strahler number -- also called the register function -- is a combinatorial tool that quantifies the branching complexity of a rooted tree. We study the law of the Horton-Strahler number of stable Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have size $n$ (including the Catalan trees), which are the finite-dimensional marginals of stable L\'evy trees. While these random variables are known to grow as a multiple of $\ln n$ in probability, their fluctuations are not well understood because they are coupled with deterministic oscillations. To rule out the latter, we introduce a real-valued variant of the Horton-Strahler number. We show that a rescaled exponential of this quantity jointly converges in distribution to a measurable function of the scaling limit of the trees, i.e. the stable L\'evy tree. We call this limit the Strahler dilation and we discuss its similarities with the Horton-Strahler number.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and develop the concepts of Geometric Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (GBSDEs, for short) and two-driver BSDEs. We demonstrate their natural suitability for modeling continuous-time dynamic return risk measures. We characterize a broad spectrum of associated, auxiliary ordinary BSDEs with drivers exhibiting growth rates involving terms of the form $y|\ln(y)|+|z|^2/y$. We establish the existence, regularity, uniqueness, and stability of solutions to this rich class of ordinary BSDEs, considering both bounded and unbounded coefficients and terminal conditions. We exploit these results to obtain corresponding results for the original two-driver BSDEs. Finally, we apply our findings within a GBSDE framework for representing the dynamics of return and star-shaped risk measures including (robust) $L^{p}$-norms, and analyze functional properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of quadratic-form optimal transport (QOT), whose transport cost has the form $\iint c\,\mathrm{d}\pi \otimes\mathrm{d}\pi$ for some coupling $\pi$ between two marginals. Interesting examples of quadratic-form transport cost and their optimization include inequality measurement, the variance of a bivariate function, covariance, Kendall's tau, the Gromov--Wasserstein distance, quadratic assignment problems, and quadratic regularization of classic optimal transport. QOT leads to substantially different mathematical structures compared to classic transport problems and many technical challenges. We illustrate the fundamental properties of QOT and provide several cases where explicit solutions are obtained. For a wide class of cost functions, including the rectangular cost functions, the QOT problem is solved by a new coupling called the diamond transport, whose copula is supported on a diamond in the unit square.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills theory, we perform a refined study of the surface sums defined in the companion work [BCSK24]. In this setting, the surface sums are a priori expected to exhibit significant simplifications because two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory is a special model that admits many known exact formulas. Thus, a natural problem is to understand these simplifications directly from the perspective of the surface sums. Towards this goal, we develop a key new tool in the form of a surface exploration algorithm (or "peeling process"), which, at each step, carefully selects the next edge to explore. Using this algorithm, we manage to find many cancellations in the surface sums, thereby obtaining a detailed understanding of precisely which surfaces remain after cancellation. As a consequence, we obtain many new explicit formulas for Wilson loop expectations of general loops in the large-$N$ limit of lattice Yang--Mills in two dimensions and prove a convergence result for the empirical spectral measure of any simple loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study branching Brownian motion in hyperbolic space. As hyperbolic Brownian motion is transient, the normalised empirical measure of branching Brownian motion converges to a random measure $\mu_\infty$ on the boundary. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of $\mathrm{supp}\ \mu_\infty$ is $(2\beta)\wedge 1$ where $\beta$ is the branching rate, and that $\mu_\infty$ admits a Lebesgue density for $\beta&gt;1/2$. This is very different to the behaviour of the set of accumulation points on the boundary where $\beta_c=1/8$ which has been shown by Lalley and Selke. This answers several questions posed by Woess in a recent survey article and similar questions posed by Candellero and Hutchcroft. We believe that our methods also apply to branching random walks on non-elementary hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>A higher-order Otto calculus approach to the Gaussian completely monotone conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian completely monotone (GCM) conjecture states that the $m$-th time-derivative of the entropy along the heat flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is positive for $m$ even and negative for $m$ odd. We prove the GCM conjecture for orders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any dimension. Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno's formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lengths of saddle connections on random translation surfaces of large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the distribution of the number of saddle connections on a random translation surface of large genus. More specifically, for genus $g$ tending to infinity, the number of saddle connections with lengths in a given interval $[\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}]$ converges in distribution to a Poisson distributed random variable. Furthermore, the numbers of saddle connections associated to disjoint intervals of lengths are independent.</description>

      <title>On Limit Formulas for Besov Seminorms and Nonlocal Perimeters in the Dunkl Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the limiting behavior of Besov seminorms and nonlocal perimeters in Dunkl theory. The present work generalizes two fundamental results: the Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova formula for Gagliardo seminorms and the asymptotics of (relative) fractional $s$-perimeters. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we establish a dimension-free Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova formula via a novel, robust approach that avoids reliance on the density property of Besov spaces, offering broader applicability. Second, we prove limit formulas for nonlocal perimeters relative to bounded open sets $\Omega$, removing boundary regularity assumptions in the forward direction, while introducing a weakened regularity condition on $\partial\Omega$ (admitting fractal boundaries) for the converse, a significant improvement over existing requirements. To the best of our knowledge, the results in this second part are new even in the classic Laplacian setting.</description>

      <title>Decoupling via Affine Spectral-Independence: Beck-Fiala and Koml\'os Bounds Beyond Banaszczyk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Beck-Fiala Conjecture [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] asserts that any set system of $n$ elements with degree $k$ has combinatorial discrepancy $O(\sqrt{k})$. A substantial generalization is the Koml\'os Conjecture, which states that any $m \times n$ matrix with unit length columns has discrepancy $O(1)$.
  In this work, we resolve the Beck-Fiala Conjecture for $k \geq \log^2 n$. We also give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{\log n})$ bound for $k \leq \log^2 n$, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides $\mathsf{poly}(\log \log n)$ factors. These bounds improve upon the $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$ bound due to Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  For the Komlos problem, we give an $\widetilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$ bound, improving upon the previous $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bound [Random Struct. Algor., 1998]. All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.
  To obtain these results, we exploit a new technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence'' in designing rounding algorithms. In particular, our algorithms obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion, guided by a semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in prior works, we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which effectively decouple the evolution of discrepancies across different rows, and allow us to better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancies at any point during the process. This new technique is quite general and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Estimating the size of a set using cascading exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite set, and $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ an i.i.d. uniform sample from $S$. To estimate the size $|S|$, without further structure, one can wait for repeats and use the birthday problem. This requires a sample size of the order $|S|^\frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,|S|\}$, the maximum of the sample blown up by $n/(n-1)$ gives an efficient estimator based on any growing sample size. This paper gives refinements that interpolate between these extremes. A general non-asymptotic theory is developed. This includes estimating the volume of a compact convex set, the unseen species problem, and a host of testing problems that follow from the question `Is this new observation a typical pick from a large prespecified population?' We also treat regression style predictors. A general theorem gives non-parametric finite $n$ error bounds in all cases.</description>
