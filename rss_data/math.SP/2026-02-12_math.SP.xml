      <title>Nonlinear elliptic Dirichlet boundary value problems on time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish existence and uniqueness results for nonlinear elliptic Dirichlet boundary value problems on n-dimensional time scale domains. Time scales provide a unified framework that encompasses continuous, discrete, and hybrid settings. Under a Lipschitz condition on the nonlinearity bounded by the first eigenvalue, we prove existence and uniqueness using the contraction mapping theorem. Under a weaker one-sided growth condition, we establish existence using the Leray--Schauder fixed point theorem. To apply these functional analytic methods, we reformulate the problem as an operator equation, which requires developing the spectral theory for the Dirichlet Laplacian with mixed nabla-delta derivatives. We establish self-adjointness, positivity, and completeness of eigenfunctions, and the product eigenfunctions form a complete orthonormal basis in the n-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample confidence regions for spectral clustering and graph centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let a graph be observed through a finite random sampling mechanism. Spectral methods are routinely applied to such graphs, yet their outputs are treated as deterministic objects. This paper develops finite-sample inference for spectral graph procedures.
  The primary result constructs explicit confidence regions for latent eigenspaces of graph operators under an explicit sampling model. These regions propagate to confidence regions for spectral clustering assignments and for smooth graph centrality functionals. All bounds are nonasymptotic and depend explicitly on the sample size, noise level, and spectral gap.
  The analysis isolates a failure of common practice: asymptotic perturbation arguments are often invoked without a finite-sample spectral gap, leading to invalid uncertainty claims. Under verifiable gap and concentration conditions, the present framework yields coverage guarantees and certified stability regions. Several corollaries address fairness-constrained post-processing and topological summaries derived from spectral embeddings.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative $L_p$-differentiability and trace formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\cM$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful semifinite trace $\tau$, and let $L_p(\cM)$ denote the associated noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Let $n\in\N$ and let $a, b$ be self-adjoint operators affiliated with $\cM$, with $b\in L_p(\cM)\cap L_{np}(\cM)$. For a function $f\in C^n(\R)$ whose derivatives $f^{(k)}$ are bounded for $1\le k\le n$, we prove that the map $\phi:t\in\R\mapsto f(a+tb)-f(a)$ is $n$-times differentiable in the $\|\cdot\|_{L_p}$-norm. This strengthens the corresponding result of de Pagter and Sukochev for $p\neq 2$ and extends it to higher-order derivatives. In addition, if $b\in \cM$, then $\phi^{(n)}$ is continuous on $\R$. Consequently, we extend the Potapov--Skripka--Sukochev higher-order trace formula from bounded $L_n(\cM)$-perturbations to not necessarily bounded perturbations in $L_n(\cM)\cap L_{n(n+1)}(\cM)$. Moreover, we show that this trace formula holds for a broader class of admissible functions than the classes previously considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>The heat trace for domains with curved corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the short-time expansion of the heat trace on planar curvilinear polygons through order $t^{1/2}$, with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $\kappa^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $\alpha$ and on the limiting curvatures $\kappa_{\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(\alpha)\,r_0(\alpha,\kappa_+, \kappa_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(\alpha)$ is given by the Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right angles we compute $c_{1/2}(\pi/2)=1/(16\sqrt{\pi})$, which yields a closed formula for the $\sqrt t$ coefficient for domains with right-angled corners. Combined with previous work on the coefficients of $t^{-1}$, $t^{-1/2}$ and $t^0$ for such domains, this determines the remaining local heat trace coefficient for planar curvilinear polygons up to order $t^{1/2}$. As an inverse spectral application we extend a result in the literature by showing that any admissible curvilinear polygon that is Dirichlet isospectral to a polygon must itself be a polygon with straight sides.</description>

      <title>Magnetic spectral inverse problems on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish positive results for two spectral inverse problems in the presence of a magnetic potential. Exploiting the principal wave trace invariants, we first observe that on closed Anosov manifolds with simple length spectrum, one can recover an electric and a magnetic (up to a natural gauge) potential from the spectrum of the associated magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. This simple observation extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Ceki\'c and T$.$Lefeuvre (2023)$.$ Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or magnetic Steklov operator) on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary determines both a magnetic potential (up to gauge) and an electric potential at the boundary, provided the latter is Anosov with simple length spectrum. Under this assumption, one can actually show that the magnetic Steklov spectrum determines the full Taylor series at the boundary of any smooth magnetic field and electric potential. As a simple consequence, in this case, both an analytic magnetic field and an analytic electric potential are uniquely determined by their Steklov spectrum.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the Dirac operator on spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain bounds for the best constants in two inequalities which can be seen as analogues of the Lieb-Thirring inequality, but with the Dirac operator, on the $n-$sphere. We then apply these results in order to improve the known upper bounds on the classical Lieb-Thirring constant on the $n$-sphere for $n\geq 5$.</description>

      <title>The strong convergence phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal 2005 paper, Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen discovered that the norm of any noncommutative polynomial of independent complex Gaussian random matrices converges to that of a limiting family of operators that arises from Voiculescu's free probability theory. In recent years, new methods have made it possible to establish such strong convergence properties in much more general situations, and to obtain even more powerful quantitative forms of the strong convergence phenomenon. These, in turn, have led to a number of spectacular applications to long-standing open problems on random graphs, hyperbolic surfaces, and operator algebras, and have provided flexible new tools that enable the study of random matrices in unexpected generality. This survey aims to provide an introduction to this circle of ideas.</description>
