      <title>MAMMAL -- Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery typically consists of multiple steps, including identifying a target protein key to a disease's etiology, validating that interacting with this target could prevent symptoms or cure the disease, discovering a small molecule or biologic therapeutic to interact with it, and optimizing the candidate molecule through a complex landscape of required properties. Drug discovery related tasks often involve prediction and generation while considering multiple entities that potentially interact, which poses a challenge for typical AI models. For this purpose we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a method that we applied to create a versatile multi-task foundation model ibm/biomed.omics.bl.sm.ma-ted-458m that learns from large-scale biological datasets (2 billion samples) across diverse modalities, including proteins, small molecules, and genes. We introduce a prompt syntax that supports a wide range of classification, regression, and generation tasks. It allows combining different modalities and entity types as inputs and/or outputs. Our model handles combinations of tokens and scalars and enables the generation of small molecules and proteins, property prediction, and transcriptomic lab test predictions. We evaluated the model on 11 diverse downstream tasks spanning different steps within a typical drug discovery pipeline, where it reaches new SOTA in 9 tasks and is comparable to SOTA in 2 tasks. This performance is achieved while using a unified architecture serving all tasks, in contrast to the original SOTA performance achieved using tailored architectures.
  The model code and pretrained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-alignment and https://huggingface.co/ibm/biomed.omics.bl.sm.ma-ted-458m.</description>

      <title>Discovering Multi-omic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Severity Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer, though most patients have a positive prognosis with many experiencing long-term survival with current treatment options. Yet, each treatment carries varying levels of intensity and side effects, therefore determining the severity of prostate cancer is an important criteria in selecting the most appropriate treatment. The Gleason score is the most common grading system used to judge the severity of prostate cancer, but much of the grading process can be affected by human error or subjectivity. Finding biomarkers for prostate cancer Gleason scores in a quantitative, machine-driven approach could enable pathologists to validate their assessment of a patient cancer sample by examining such biomarkers. In our study, we identified biomarkers from multi-omics data using machine learning, statistical tools, and deep learning to train models against the Gleason score and capture the most important features that could potentially serve as biomarkers for the Gleason score. Through this process, multiple genes, such as COL1A1 and SFRP4, and cell cycle pathways, such as G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, and the PLK1 pathways, were found to be important predictive features for particular Gleason scores. The combination of these analytical methods shows potential for more accurate grading of prostate cancer, and greater understanding of biological processes behind prostate cancer severity that could provide additional therapeutic targets.</description>

      <title>ET-Flow: Equivariant Flow-Matching for Molecular Conformer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting low-energy molecular conformations given a molecular graph is an important but challenging task in computational drug discovery. Existing state-of-the-art approaches either resort to large scale transformer-based models that diffuse over conformer fields, or use computationally expensive methods to generate initial structures and diffuse over torsion angles. In this work, we introduce Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow). We showcase that a well-designed flow matching approach with equivariance and harmonic prior alleviates the need for complex internal geometry calculations and large architectures, contrary to the prevailing methods in the field. Our approach results in a straightforward and scalable method that directly operates on all-atom coordinates with minimal assumptions. With the advantages of equivariance and flow matching, ET-Flow significantly increases the precision and physical validity of the generated conformers, while being a lighter model and faster at inference. Code is available https://github.com/shenoynikhil/ETFlow.</description>

      <title>Learning Identifiable Factorized Causal Representations of Cellular Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of cells and their responses to genetic or chemical perturbations promises to accelerate the discovery of therapeutic targets. However, designing adequate and insightful models for such data is difficult because the response of a cell to perturbations essentially depends on its biological context (e.g., genetic background or cell type). For example, while discovering therapeutic targets, one may want to enrich for drugs that specifically target a certain cell type. This challenge emphasizes the need for methods that explicitly take into account potential interactions between drugs and contexts. Towards this goal, we propose a novel Factorized Causal Representation (FCR)
  learning method that reveals causal structure in single-cell perturbation data from several cell lines. Based on the framework of identifiable deep generative models, FCR learns multiple cellular representations that are disentangled, comprised of covariate-specific ($\mathbf{z}_x$), treatment-specific ($\mathbf{z}_{t}$), and interaction-specific ($\mathbf{z}_{tx}$) blocks. Based on recent advances in non-linear ICA theory, we prove the component-wise identifiability of $\mathbf{z}_{tx}$ and block-wise identifiability of $\mathbf{z}_t$ and $\mathbf{z}_x$. Then, we present our implementation of FCR, and empirically demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various tasks across four single-cell datasets.</description>

      <title>Crossed laser phase plates for transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades since the development of phase-contrast optical microscopy, an analogous approach has been sought for maximizing the image contrast of weakly-scattering objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The recent development of the laser phase plate (LPP) has demonstrated that an amplified, focused laser standing wave provides stable, tunable phase shift to the high-energy electron beam, achieving phase-contrast TEM. Building on proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations, this paper explores design improvements tailored to biological imaging. In particular, we introduce the approach of crossed laser phase plates (XLPP): two laser standing waves intersecting in the diffraction plane of the TEM, rather than a single beam as in the current LPP. We provide a theoretical model for the XLPP inside the microscope and use simulations to quantify its effect on image formation. We find that the XLPP increases information transfer at low spatial frequencies while also suppressing the ghost images formed by Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of the electron beam by the laser beam. We also demonstrate a simple acquisition scheme, enabled by the XLPP, which dramatically suppresses unwanted diffraction effects. The results of this study chart the course for future developments of LPP hardware.</description>
