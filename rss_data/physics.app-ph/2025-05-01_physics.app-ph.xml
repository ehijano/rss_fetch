      <title>Infrared photothermal heterodyne imaging in thermally thick medium for thermo-optic property characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring temperature fields in semi-transparent media requires the knowledge of material thermo-optic properties. While the current techniques are well established for isothermal thin films, they remain unexplored for thick media where temperature gradients need to be considered. This study proposes to generalize the current methods of infrared heterodyne photothermal imaging to thick media by combining transmittance measurements and thermo-optic modeling to measure simultaneously the thermoabsorbance and thermoreflectance coefficients in semi-transparent media. In this work, we demonstrate the validity of our methodology followed by the measurements of the thermo-optic properties of several materials: soft polymers (polydimethylsiloxane) and borofloat glasses.</description>

      <title>Thermal noise induced probability switching in magnetic tunnel junction based on spin-circuit simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability switching characteristics in spin transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) are simulated by considering thermal noise using a spin-circuit module. Thermal noise significantly affects the probability switching for pulse durations exceeding 10 ns, while no probability switching properties are observed for pulses shorter than 1 ns due to the precessional switching. For pulse durations between 1 ns and 10 ns, the occurrence of mixed probability and abrupt switching suggests that thermal noise partially influences the switching properties. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our simulation model in capturing the MTJ properties under the influence of thermal noise. The spin-circuit module used in this study lays the groundwork for future circuit system designs utilizing MTJ devices, such as true random number generators and neural network computing.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Twist Conservation in Nonlinear Optical Three-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct an experimental investigation into the conservation of the twist phase in Twisted Gaussian Schell Model (TGSM) beams during both up- and down-conversion three-wave mixing nonlinear processes. Independently generated TGSM beams, prepared with varying twist parameters, are used to pump and seed the nonlinear interactions. The resulting beams are then analyzed to determine their twist properties. Our findings demonstrate that the twists of the up- and down-converted beams depend on those of the pump and seed beams. Additionally, the results indicate that the twist phase is conserved throughout the process, in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. This study is motivated by the increasing potential applications of TGSM beams in various fields.</description>

      <title>Emergent Synaptic Plasticity from Tunable Dynamics of Probabilistic Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic (p-) computing, which leverages the stochasticity of its building blocks (p-bits) to solve a variety of computationally hard problems, has recently emerged as a promising physics-inspired hardware accelerator platform. A functionality of importance for p-computers is the ability to program-and reprogram-the interaction strength between arbitrary p-bits on-chip. In natural systems subject to random fluctuations, it is known that spatiotemporal noise can interact with the system's nonlinearities to render useful functionalities. Leveraging that principle, here we introduce a novel scheme for tunable coupling that inserts a ''hidden'' p-bit between each pair of computational p-bits. By modulating the fluctuation rate of the hidden p-bit relative to the synapse speed, we demonstrate both numerically and analytically that the effective interaction between the computational p-bits can be continuously tuned. Moreover, this tunability is directional, where the effective coupling from one computational p-bit to another can be made different from the reverse. This synaptic-plasticity mechanism could open new avenues for designing (re-)configurable p-computers and may inspire novel algorithms that leverage dynamic, hardware-level tuning of stochastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Ultralow-Mass Nuclear Magnetic Resonance using Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically active quantum defects in solids, such as the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are a leading modality for micron-scale and nanoscale (ultralow-mass) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging under ambient conditions. However, the spin and optical properties of NV centers degrade when closer than about 10 nm from the diamond surface, limiting NMR sensitivity as well as spectral and spatial resolution. Here we outline efforts to develop an alternative nanoscale NMR sensor using the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). As a van der Waals material, hBN's surface is free from dangling bonds and other sources of paramagnetic noise that degrade the performance of near surface NVs, allowing stable $V_B^-$ defects to exist $\sim1\,$nm from the material surface. We discuss the properties of boron vacancies as they apply to narrowband (AC) magnetic field sensing and outline experimental designs optimized for this system. We propose measurement protocols for $V_B^-$ NMR for both statistically and uniformly polarized samples at the nano- and micron-scales, including relevant pulse sequences, sensitivity calculations, and sample confinement strategies; and compare the expected performance to NV-NMR. We estimate back-action effects between the $V_B^-$ electronic spins and the sample nuclear spins at the nanoscale; and account for unconventional diffusion dynamics in the flow-restricted nanoscale regime, calculating its effects on the expected $V_B^-$ NMR signal. Lastly, we identify potential sample targets and operational regimes best suited for both nanoscale and micron-scale $V_B^-$ NMR.</description>

      <title>Stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods for liquid laser with near-zero threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising optical gain materials that require further threshold reduction to realize their full potential. While QD charging theoretically reduces the threshold to zero, its effectiveness has been limited by strong Auger recombination and unstable charging. Here we theoretically reveal the optimal combination of charging number and Auger recombination to minimize the lasing threshold. Experimentally, we develop stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods (QRs) as an alternative to QDs via state engineering and Mn-doping strategy. An unprecedented two-order-of-magnitude reduction in nonradiative Auger recombination enables QRs to support a sufficient charging number of up to 6. The QR liquid lasing is then achieved with a near-zero threshold of 0.098 using quasi-continuous pumping of nanosecond pulses, which is the lowest threshold among all reported QD lasers. These achievements demonstrate the potential of the specially engineered QRs as an excellent gain media and pave the way for their prospective applications.</description>

      <title>Photonic Crystal Microring Resonators on a Hybrid Silicon Nitride-on-Lithium Niobate Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) have been widely used in nonlinear integrated photonics for frequency engineering applications. A microwave-assisted frequency converter based on PhCRs highlights its precise control of frequency (enabled by creation of a pair of supermodes by a corrugated PhCR) and bidirectional frequency conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate a high-quality PhCR on a hybrid silicon nitride-on-lithium niobate-on-insulator (SiN-on-LNOI) platform for the first time for voltage-driven flexible frequency conversion using the electro-optic effect (0.85 pm/V). The fabricated PhCR has a large supermode splitting bandwidth = 14.6 GHz and an intrinsic quality factor (Q) = 147,000. Using different periodic corrugation amplitudes in the fabricated PhCRs enables the precise control of mode splitting with a ratio of 93.5 MHz/nm between the mode splitting bandwidth and the corrugation amplitude.</description>

Abstract: This work describes sputtered scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) thin-film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR) at 12.5 GHz with high electromechanical coupling (k2) of 9.5% and quality factor (Q) of 208, resulting in a figure of merit (FoM, Qk2) of 19.8. ScAlN resonators employ a stack of 90 nm thick 20% Sc doping ScAlN piezoelectric film on the floating bottom 38 nm thick platinum (Pt) electrode to achieve low losses and high coupling toward centimeter wave (cmWave) frequency band operation. Three fabricated and FBARs are reported, show promising prospects of ScAlN-Pt stack towards cmWave front-end filters.</description>
