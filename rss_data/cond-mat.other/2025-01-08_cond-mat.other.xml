      <title>Sub-micron Circuit Fabrication on Diamond Anvils for Mesoscopic High-Pressure Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Zeno Freezing and Anti-Zeno Acceleration of the Dynamic Evolution of Acoustic Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements severely disrupt the dynamic evolution of a quantum system by collapsing the probabilistic wavefunction. This principle can be leveraged to control quantum states by effectively freezing the system's dynamics or enhancing transitions between states. These are known as the quantum Zeno effect (ZE) and anti-Zeno effect (AZE), respectively. However, it remains elusive how quantum measurements affect topological states, which are famous for their robustness against disorder and perturbations. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that the dynamic evolution of topological boundary states (TBSs) can be controlled by quantum-like measurement (QLM). Our work is based on spatially modulated topological acoustic waveguide systems with varying parameters that adiabatically pump the TBS across the bulk to the opposite boundary. Therein, the QLM is emulated using a perturbation to the Hamiltonian known as the Zeno subspace. With the help of quantum metrics, we identify the general conditions for ZE and AZE, and experimentally demonstrate their effects in freezing and accelerating the tunneling of the TBS. Furthermore, we discover a tunneling mechanism by varying the strength of the QLM. These results highlight QLM as a versatile tool for manipulating topological states and wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum materials properties using novel faithful machine learning embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating the progress of materials prediction and classification, with particular success in CGNN designs. While classical ML methods remain accessible, advanced deep networks are still challenging to build and train. We introduce two new adaptations and refine two existing ML networks for generic crystalline quantum materials properties prediction and optimization. These new models achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting TQC classification and strong performance in predicting band gaps, magnetic classifications, formation energies, and symmetry group. All networks easily generalize to all quantum crystalline materials property predictions. To support this, full implementations and automated methods for data handling and materials predictions are provided, facilitating the use of deep ML methods in quantum materials science. Finally, dataset error rates are analyzed using an ensemble model to identify and highlight highly atypical materials for further investigations.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient nonvolatile magnetization switching and multi-level states by current in single van der Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust multi-level spin memory with the ability to write information electrically is a long-sought capability in spintronics, with great promise for applications. Here we achieve nonvolatile and highly energy-efficient magnetization switching in a single-material device formed of van-der-Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, whose magnetic information can be readily controlled by a tiny current. Furthermore, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 400 and 4000 times smaller than those of the existing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory based on conventional magnet/heavy-metal systems. Most importantly, we also demonstrate multi-level states, switched by electrical current, which can dramatically enhance the information capacity density and reduce computing costs. Thus, our observations combine both high energy efficiency and large information capacity density in one device, showcasing the potential applications of the emerging field of van-der-Waals magnets in the field of spin memory and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Unexpected versatile electrical transport behaviors of ferromagnetic nickel films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnets is paramount for electrically controlled spintronics due to their intrinsic potentials for higher memory density, scalability, thermal stability and endurance, surpassing an in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Nickel film is a long-lived fundamental element ferromagnet, yet its electrical transport behavior associated with magnetism has not been comprehensively studied, hindering corresponding spintronic applications exploiting nickel-based compounds. Here, we systematically investigate the highly versatile magnetism and corresponding transport behavior of nickel films. As the thickness reduces within the general thickness regime of a magnet layer for a memory device, the hardness of nickel films' ferromagnetic loop of anomalous Hall effect increases and then decreases, reflecting the magnetic transitions from IMA to PMA and back to IMA. Additionally, the square ferromagnetic loop changes from a hard to a soft one at rising temperatures, indicating a shift from PMA to IMA. Furthermore, we observe a butterfly magnetoresistance resulting from the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, which evolves in conjunction with the thickness and temperature-dependent magnetic transformations as a complementary support. Our findings unveil the rich magnetic dynamics and most importantly settle down the most useful guiding information for current-driven spintronic applications based on nickel film: The hysteresis loop is squarest for the ~8 nm-thick nickel film, of highest hardness with Rxyr/Rxys~1 and minimum Hs-Hc, up to 125 K; otherwise, extra care should be taken for a different thickness or at a higher temperature.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Frequency Combs and Pulse Generation based on Single Section Interband Cascade Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interband Cascade Lasers (ICLs) are semiconductor lasers emitting in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR 3-6 {\mu}m) and can operate as frequency combs (FCs). These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio-frequency operation. Here we show that ICLs FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at {\lambda} ~ 4.2 {\mu}m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified SWIFT spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free-running operation. Further, we show that, through active modelocking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (~100ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.</description>
