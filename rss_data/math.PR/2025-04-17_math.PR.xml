      <title>Zeros and exponential profiles of polynomials I: Limit distributions, finite free convolutions and repeated differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of polynomials $(P_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with only nonpositive zeros, the aim of this article is to present a user-friendly approach for determining the limiting zero distribution of $P_n$ as $\mathrm{deg}\, P_n \to \infty$. The method is based on establishing an equivalence between the existence of a limiting empirical zero distribution $\mu$ and the existence of an exponential profile $g$ associated with the coefficients of the polynomials $(P_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. The exponential profile $g$, which can be roughly described by $[z^k]P_n(z) \approx \exp(n g(k/n))$, offers a direct route to computing the Cauchy transform $G$ of $\mu$: the functions $t \mapsto tG(t)$ and $\alpha \mapsto \exp(-g'(\alpha))$ are mutual inverses. This relationship, in various forms, has previously appeared in the literature, most notably in the paper [Van Assche, Fano and Ortolani, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 1987].
  As a first contribution, we present a self-contained probabilistic proof of this equivalence by representing the polynomials as generating functions of sums of independent Bernoulli random variables. This probabilistic framework naturally lends itself to tools from large deviation theory, such as the exponential change of measure. The resulting theorems generalize and unify a range of previously known results, which were traditionally established through analytic or combinatorial methods.
  Secondly, using the profile-based approach, we investigate how the exponential profile and the limiting zero distribution behave under certain operations on polynomials, including finite free convolutions, Hadamard products, and repeated differentiation. In particular, our approach yields new proofs of the convergence results `$\boxplus_n \to \boxplus$' and `$\boxtimes_n \to \boxtimes$', extending them to cases where the distributions are not necessarily compactly supported.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for critical marked Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a central limit type theorem for critical marked Hawkes process. We study the case where the marks are i.i.d. with nonnegative values and their common distribution is either heavy tailed or has finite variance. The kernel function is of a multiplicative form and the mean number of future events triggered by a single event is 1 (criticality). We also assume that the base intensity function is heavy tailed. We prove convergence in law in the space of tempered distributions of the normalized empirical measure corresponding to the times of events. We also show convergence of finite dimensional distributions of the normalized marked Hawkes process. In case when the distribution of marks is heavy tailed, the limit process is a stable process with dependent increments.</description>

      <title>Toward a Hazard Rate Framework for Regular and Rapid Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular and rapid variation have been extensively studied in the literature and applied across various fields, particularly in extreme value theory. In this paper, we examine regular and rapid variation through the lens of generalized hazard rates, with a focus on the behavior of survival and density functions of random variables. Motivated by the von Mises condition, our hazard rate based framework offers a unified approach that spans from slow to rapid variation, providing in particular new insights into the relationship between hazard rate functions and the right tail decays of random variables.</description>

      <title>Multi-type $\Xi$-coalescents from structured population models with bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an individual-based model for structured populations undergoing demographic bottlenecks, i.e. drastic reductions in population size that last many generations and can have arbitrary shapes. We first show that the (non-Markovian) allele-frequency process converges to a Markovian diffusion process with jumps in a suitable relaxation of the Skorokhod J1 topology. Backward in time we find that genealogies of samples of individuals are described by multi-type $\Xi$-coalescents presenting multiple simultaneous mergers with simultaneous migrations. These coalescents are also moment-duals of the limiting jump diffusions. We then show through a numerical study that our model is flexible and can predict various shapes for the site frequency spectrum, consistent with real data, using a small number of interpretable parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Regularity of Random 2-SAT and 3-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the random $k$-SAT problem with $n$ variables, $m=m(n)$ clauses, and clause density $\alpha=\lim_{n\to\infty}m/n$ for $k=2,3$. It is known that if $\alpha$ is small enough, then the random $k$-SAT problem admits a solution with high probability, which we interpret as the problem being under-constrained. In this paper, we quantify exactly how under-constrained the random $k$-SAT problems are by determining their degrees of freedom, which we define as the threshold for the number of variables we can fix to an arbitrary value before the problem no longer is solvable with high probability. We show that the random $2$-SAT and $3$-SAT problems have $n/m^{1/2}$ and $n/m^{1/3}$ degrees of freedom, respectively. Our main result is an explicit computation of the corresponding threshold functions. Our result shows that the threshold function for the random $2$-SAT problem is regular, while it is non-regular for the random $3$-SAT problem. By regular, we mean continuous and analytic on the interior of its support. This result shows that the random $3$-SAT problem is more sensitive to small changes in the clause density $\alpha$ than the random $2$-SAT problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive strong Lp convergence rates for the Euler-Maruyama schemes of Levy-driven SDE using a new dynamic cutting (DC) method with a time-dependent jump threshold. In addition, we present results from numerical simulations comparing the DC and Asmussen-Rosinski (AR) approaches. These simulations demonstrate the superior accuracy achieved by the DC method.</description>

      <title>Non-local Wasserstein Geometry, Gradient Flows, and Functional Inequalities for Stationary Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a non-local Benamou-Brenier-type transport distance on the space of stationary point processes and analyse the induced geometry. We show that our metric is a specific variant of the transport distance recently constructed in [DSHS24]. As a consequence, we show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup is the gradient flow of the specific relative entropy w.r.t. the newly constructed distance. Furthermore, we show the existence of stationary geodesics, establish $1$-geodesic convexity of the specific relative entropy, and derive stationary analogues of functional inequalities such as a specific HWI inequality and a specific Talagrand inequality. One of the key technical contributions is the existence of solutions to the non-local continuity equation between arbitrary point processes.</description>

      <title>The rank evolution of block bidiagonal matrices over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate uniform random block lower bidiagonal matrices over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and prove that their rank undergoes a phase transition.
  First, we consider block lower bidiagonal matrices with $(k_n+1)\times k_n$ blocks where each block is of size $n\times n$. We prove that if $k_n\ll q^{n/2}$, then these matrices have full rank with high probability, and if $k_n\gg q^{n/2}$, then the rank has Gaussian fluctuations.
  Second, we consider block lower bidiagonal matrices with $k_n\times k_n$ blocks where each block is of size $n\times n$. We prove that if $k_n\ll q^{n/2}$, then the rank exhibits the same constant order fluctuations as the rank of the matrix products considered by Nguyen and Van Peski, and if $k_n\gg q^{n/2}$, then the rank has Gaussian fluctuations.
  Finally, we also consider a truncated version of the first model, where we prove that at $k_n\approx q^{n/2}$, we have a phase transition between a Cohen-Lenstra and a Gaussian limiting behavior of the rank. We also show that there is a localization/delocalization phase transition for the vectors in the kernels of these matrices at the same critical point.
  In all three cases, we also provide a precise description of the behavior of the rank at criticality.
  These results are proved by analyzing the limiting behavior of a Markov chain obtained from the increments of the ranks of these matrices.</description>

      <title>Exceptional times when bigeodesics exist in dynamical last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is believed that, under very general conditions, doubly infinite geodesics (or bigeodesics) do not exist for planar first and last passage percolation (LPP) models. However, if one endows the model with a natural dynamics, thereby gradually perturbing the geometry, then it is plausible that there could exist a non-trivial set of exceptional times $\mathscr{T}$ at which such bigeodesics exist, and the objective of this paper is to investigate this set. For dynamical exponential LPP, we obtain an $\Omega( 1/\log n)$ lower bound on the probability that there exists a random time $t\in [0,1]$ at which a geodesic of length $n$ passes through the origin at its midpoint -- note that this is slightly short of proving the non-triviality of the set $\mathscr{T}$ which would instead require an $\Omega(1)$ lower bound. In the other direction, working with a dynamical version of Brownian LPP, we show that the average total number of changes that a geodesic of length $n$ accumulates in unit time is at most $n^{5/3+o(1)}$; using this, we establish that the Hausdorff dimension of $\mathscr{T}$ is a.s. upper bounded by $1/2$. Further, for a fixed angle $\theta$, we show that the set $\mathscr{T}^\theta\subseteq \mathscr{T}$ of exceptional times at which a $\theta$-directed bigeodesic exists a.s. has Hausdorff dimension zero. We provide a list of open questions.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian geometry of the probability space of the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the Riemannian geometry of the Wasserstein space of the circle, namely $P(S^{1})$, the set of probability measures on the unit circle endowed with the 2-Wasserstein metric. Building on the foundational work of Otto, Lott, and Villani, the authors developed in another work an intrinsic framework for studying the differential geometry of Wasserstein spaces of compact Lie groups, making use of the Peter-Weyl Theorem. This formalism allowed them to explicit an example in this paper. Key contributions include explicit computations of the Riemannian metric matrix coefficients, Lie brackets, and the Levi-Civita connection, along with its associated Christoffel symbols. The geodesic equations and curves with constant velocity fields are analysed, expliciting their PDEs. Notably, the paper demonstrates that $P(S^{1})$ is flat, with vanishing curvature. These results provide a comprehensive geometric understanding of $P(S^{1})$, connecting optimal transport theory and differential geometry, with potential applications in dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the author introduces new methods to construct Archimedean copulas. The generator of each copula fulfills the sufficient conditions as regards the boundary and being continuous, decreasing, and convex. Each inverse generator also fulfills the necessary conditions as regards the boundary conditions, marginal uniformity, and 2-increasing properties. Although these copulas satisfy these conditions, they have some limitations. They do not cover the entire dependency spectrum, ranging from perfect negative dependency to perfect positive dependency, passing through the independence state</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Spectral Distribution of a non-Hermitian $\beta$-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-Hermitian $\beta$-ensemble and determine its spectral density in the limit of large $\beta$ and large matrix size $n$. The ensemble is given by a general tridiagonal complex random matrix of normal and chi-distributed random variables, extending previous work of two of the authors. The joint distribution of eigenvalues contains a Vandermonde determinant to the power $\beta$ and a residual coupling to the eigenvectors. A tool in the computation of the limiting spectral density is a single characteristic polynomial for centred tridiagonal Jacobi matrices, for which we explicitly determine the coefficients in terms of its matrix elements. In the low temperature limit $\beta\gg1$ our ensemble reduces to such a centred matrix with vanishing diagonal. A general theorem from free probability based on the variance of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial allows us to obtain the spectral density when additionally taking the large-$n$ limit. It is rotationally invariant on a compact disc, given by the logarithm of the radius plus a constant. The same density is obtained when starting form a tridiagonal complex symmetric ensemble, which thus plays a special role. Extensive numerical simulations confirm our analytical results and put this and the previously studied ensemble in the context of the pseudospectrum.</description>

      <title>A Peano curve from mated geodesic trees in the directed landscape</title>

Abstract: For the directed landscape, the putative universal space-time scaling limit object in the (1+1) dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, consider the geodesic tree -- the tree formed by the coalescing semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction. As shown in Bhatia '23, this tree comes interlocked with a dual tree, which (up to a reflection) has the same marginal law as the geodesic tree. Analogous examples of one ended planar trees formed by coalescent semi-infinite random paths and their duals are objects of interest in various other probability models, a classical example being the Brownian web, which is constructed as a scaling limit of coalescent random walks. In this paper, we continue the study of the geodesic tree and its dual in the directed landscape and exhibit a new space-filling curve traversing between the two trees that is naturally parametrized by the area it covers and encodes the geometry of the two trees; this parallels the construction of the T\'oth-Werner curve between the Brownian web and its dual. We study the regularity and fractal properties of this Peano curve, exploiting simultaneously the symmetries of the directed landscape and probabilistic estimates obtained in planar exponential last passage percolation, which is known to converge to the directed landscape in the scaling limit. On the way, we develop a novel coalescence estimate for geodesics, and this has recently found application in other work.</description>

      <title>Moments of polynomial functionals of spectrally positive L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11137v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $J(\cdot)$ be a compound Poisson process with rate $\lambda&gt;0$ and a jumps distribution $G(\cdot)$ concentrated on $(0,\infty)$. In addition, let $V$ be a random variable which is distributed according to $G(\cdot)$ and independent from $J(\cdot)$. Define a new process $W(t)\equiv W_V(t)\equiv V+J(t)-t$, $t\geqslant 0$ and let $\tau_V$ be the first time that $W(\cdot)$ hits the origin. A long-standing open problem due to Iglehart (1971) and Cohen (1979) is to derive the moments of the functional $\int_0^\tau W(t)\,{\rm d}t$ in terms of the moments of $G(\cdot)$ and $\lambda$. In the current work, we solve this problem in much greater generality, i.e., first by letting $J(\cdot)$ belong to a wide class of spectrally positive \color{black} L\'evy processes and secondly, by considering more general class of functionals. We also supply several applications of the existing results, e.g., in studying the process $x\mapsto \int_0^{\tau_x}W_x(t)\,{\rm d}t$ defined on $x\in[0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence, uniqueness and stability results for the obstacle problem associated with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion equation perturbed by conservative gradient noise. Our approach revolves round introducing a new entropy formulation for stochastic variational inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain a novel well-posedness result for the obstacle problem of deterministic porous medium equations with nonlinear reaction terms.</description>

      <title>2d Sinh-Gordon model on the infinite cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $R&gt;0$, we give a rigorous probabilistic construction on the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times (\mathbb{R}/(2\pi R\mathbb{Z}))$ of the (massless) Sinh-Gordon model. In particular we define the $n$-point correlation functions of the model and show that these exhibit a scaling relation with respect to $R$. The construction, which relies on the massless Gaussian Free Field, is based on the spectral analysis of a quantum operator associated to the model. Using the theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos, we prove that this operator has discrete spectrum and a strictly positive ground state.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Shenanigans: Permutons from pipe dreams via integrable probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random permutations arising from reduced pipe dreams. Our main model is motivated by Grothendieck polynomials with parameter $\beta=1$ arising in K-theory of the flag variety. The probability weight of a permutation is proportional to the principal specialization (setting all variables to 1) of the corresponding Grothendieck polynomial. By mapping this random permutation to a version of TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), we describe the limiting permuton and fluctuations around it as the order $n$ of the permutation grows to infinity. The fluctuations are of order $n^{\frac13}$ and have the Tracy-Widom GUE distribution, which places this algebraic (K-theoretic) model into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.
  We also investigate non-reduced pipe dreams and make progress on a recent open problem on the asymptotic number of inversions of the resulting permutation. Inspired by Stanley's question for the maximal value of principal specializations of Schubert polynomials, we resolve the analogous question for $\beta=1$ Grothendieck polynomials, and provide bounds for general $\beta$.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for free multiplicative Brownian motions via spherical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After some normalization, the logarithms of the ordered singular values of Brownian motions on $GL(N,\mathbb F)$ with $\mathbb F=\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ form Weyl-group invariant Heckman-Opdam processes on $\mathbb R^N$ of type $A_{N-1}$. We use classical elementary formulas for the spherical functions of $GL(N,\mathbb C)/SU(N)$ and the associated Euclidean spaces $H(N,\mathbb C)$ of Hermitian matrices, and show that in the $GL(N,\mathbb C)$-case, these processes can be also interpreted as ordered eigenvalues of Brownian motions on $H(N,\mathbb C)$ with particular drifts. This leads to an explicit description for the free limits for the associated empirical processes for $N\to\infty$ where these limits are independent from the parameter $k$ of the Heckman-Opdam processes. In particular we get new formulas for the distributions of the free multiplicative Browniam motion of Biane. We also show how this approach works for the root systems $B_N, C_N, D_N$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of L\'evy tax processes with bailouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider controlling the paths of a spectrally negative L\'evy process by two means: the subtraction of `taxes' when the process is at an all-time maximum, and the addition of `bailouts' which keep the value of the process above zero. We solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem of maximising the expected present value of the difference between taxes received and cost of bailouts given. Our class of taxation controls is larger than has been considered up till now in the literature and makes the problem truly two-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Along the way, we define and characterise a large class of controlled L\'evy processes to which the optimal solution belongs, which extends a known result for perturbed Brownian motions to the case of a general L\'evy process with no positive jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of singular numbers for all principal corners of a $p$-adic Hermitian (resp. alternating) matrix with additive Haar distribution, the non-archimedean analogue of the GUE (resp. aGUE) corners process. In the alternating case we find that it is a Hall-Littlewood process, explaining -- and recovering as a corollary -- results of Fulman-Kaplan. In the Hermitian case we obtain a `marginal distribution' of a formal Hall-Littlewood process with both positive and negative transition `probabilities'. The proofs relate natural random matrix operations to structural results of Hironaka and Hironaka-Sato on modules over the spherical Hecke algebra, yielding other probabilistic statements of independent interest along the way.</description>

      <title>Symmetric splitting of one-dimensional noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetric random walk $X$ whose jumps have diffuse law, looked at up to an independent geometric random time, splits at the minimum into two independent and identically distributed pieces. The same for the maximum. It is natural to ask, are there any other times adapted to $X$ exhibiting this "symmetric splitting"? It appears that the phenomenon is most conveniently couched in terms of (what may be called) the noise structure of $X$. At the level of generality of the latter, an equivalent set-theoretic condition for the symmetric splitting property is provided, leading to the observation that the answer to the elucidated question is to the affirmative. While we do not deal much with the obvious analog of the phenomenon in continuous time, the discrete findings do beg the question: does linear Brownian motion admit times of symmetric splitting other than the maxima and minima? This is left unresolved, but we do make some comments as to why it may be non-trivial/interesting.</description>

      <title>Efficient Rare-Event Simulation for Random Geometric Graphs via Importance Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random geometric graphs defined on Euclidean subspaces, also called Gilbert graphs, are widely used to model spatially embedded networks across various domains. In such graphs, nodes are located at random in Euclidean space, and any two nodes are connected by an edge if they lie within a certain distance threshold. Accurately estimating rare-event probabilities related to key properties of these graphs, such as the number of edges and the size of the largest connected component, is important in the assessment of risk associated with catastrophic incidents, for example. However, this task is computationally challenging, especially for large networks. Importance sampling offers a viable solution by concentrating computational efforts on significant regions of the graph. This paper explores the application of an importance sampling method to estimate rare-event probabilities, highlighting its advantages in reducing variance and enhancing accuracy. Through asymptotic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, contributing to improved analysis of Gilbert graphs and showcasing the broader applicability of importance sampling in complex network analysis.</description>

      <title>Tangled Paths: A Random Graph Model from Mallows Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the random graph $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ which results from taking the union of two paths of length $n\geq 1$, where the vertices of one of the paths have been relabelled according to a Mallows permutation with parameter $0&lt;q(n)\leq 1$. This random graph model, the tangled path, goes through an evolution: if $q$ is close to $0$ the graph bears resemblance to a path, and as $q$ tends to $1$ it becomes an expander. In an effort to understand the evolution of $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ we determine the treewidth and cutwidth of $\mathcal{P}(n,q)$ up to log factors for all $q$. We also show that the property of having a separator of size one has a sharp threshold. In addition, we prove bounds on the diameter, and vertex isoperimetric number for specific values of $q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the parameters of a latent variable causal model is central to causal inference and causal identification. In this article, we show that existing graphical structures that are used in causal inference are not stable under marginalization of Gaussian Bayesian networks, and present a graphical structure that faithfully represent margins of Gaussian Bayesian networks. We present the first duality between parameter optimization of a latent variable model and training a feed-forward neural network in the parameter space of the assumed family of distributions. Based on this observation, we develop an algorithm for parameter optimization of these graphical structures based on a given observational distribution. Then, we provide conditions for causal effect identifiability in the Gaussian setting. We propose an meta-algorithm that checks whether a causal effect is identifiable or not. Moreover, we lay a grounding for generalizing the duality between a neural network and a causal model from the Gaussian to other distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept evolutionary semigroups on path spaces, generalizing the notion of transition semigroups to possibly non-Markovian stochastic processes. We study the basic properties of evolutionary semigroups and, in particular, prove that they always arise as the composition of the shift semigroup and a single operator called the expectation operator of the semigroup. We also prove that the transition semigroup of a Markov process can always be extended to an evolutionary semigroup on the path space whenever the Markov process can be realized with the appropriate path regularity. As first examples of evolutionary semigroups associated to non-Markovian processes, we discuss deterministic evolution equations and stochastic flows driven by L\'evy processes. The latter in particular include certain stochastic delay equations.</description>

      <title>Future Aware Safe Active Learning of Time Varying Systems using Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental exploration of high-cost systems with safety constraints, common in engineering applications, is a challenging endeavor. Data-driven models offer a promising solution, but acquiring the requisite data remains expensive and is potentially unsafe. Safe active learning techniques prove essential, enabling the learning of high-quality models with minimal expensive data points and high safety. This paper introduces a safe active learning framework tailored for time-varying systems, addressing drift, seasonal changes, and complexities due to dynamic behavior. The proposed Time-aware Integrated Mean Squared Prediction Error (T-IMSPE) method minimizes posterior variance over current and future states, optimizing information gathering also in the time domain. Empirical results highlight T-IMSPE's advantages in model quality through toy and real-world examples. State of the art Gaussian processes are compatible with T-IMSPE. Our theoretical contributions include a clear delineation which Gaussian process kernels, domains, and weighting measures are suitable for T-IMSPE and even beyond for its non-time aware predecessor IMSPE.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop an intrinsic formalism to study the topology, smooth structure, and Riemannian geometry of the Wasserstein space of a closed Riemannian manifold. Our formalism allows for a new characterisation of the Weak topology via convergent sequences of the subjacent space. Applying it we also provide a new proof that Wasserstein spaces of closed manifolds are geodesically convex. Our framework is particularly handy to address the Wasserstein spaces of compact Lie groups, where we refine our formalism and present an explicit example.</description>

Abstract: Enhanced binding of a quantum particle coupled to a quantized field means that the Hamiltonian of the particle alone does not have a bound state, while the particle-field Hamiltonian does. For the Pauli--Fierz model, this is usually shown via the binding condition, which works less well in the case of a linear coupling to a scalar field. In particular, the case of a single particle linearly coupled to a scalar field has been open so far. Using a method relying on functional integrals and the Gaussian correlation inequality, we obtain enhanced binding for this case. From a statistical mechanics point of view, our result describes a localization phase transition (in the strength of the pair potential) for a Brownian motion subject to an external and an attractive pair potential.</description>

      <title>Martingale properties of entropy production and a generalized work theorem with decoupled forward and backward processes</title>

Abstract: By decoupling forward and backward stochastic trajectories, we construct a family of martingales and work theorems for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our results are made possible by an alternative derivation of work theorems that uses tools from stochastic calculus instead of path-integration. We further strengthen the equality in work theorems by evaluating expectations conditioned on an arbitrary initial state value. These generalizations extend the applicability of work theorems and offer new interpretations of entropy production in stochastic systems. Lastly, we discuss the violation of work theorems in far-from-equilibrium systems.</description>
