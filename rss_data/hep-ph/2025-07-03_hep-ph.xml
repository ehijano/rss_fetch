      <title>PQ-ball and its Real Scalar Analogue in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of quasi-stable localized scalar configurations in spontaneously symmetry breaking U(1) model by 3+1-dimensional classical lattice simulations. Such configurations are called PQ-balls, as the primary motivation of this kind of configuration is Peccei-Quinn theory under the kinetic misalignment mechanism. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that they can form if the PQ charge is generated through the coherent rotation of a complex scalar field in the complex plane, via dynamics analogous to the Affleck-Dine mechanism. These configurations subsequently decay due to the U(1)-breaking effect induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate the formation and decay of oscillons in a similar setup in a real scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>QED positronium and the exact renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is studied in the framework of the exact (functional) renormalization group (ERG). This is done using an approach to these equations which employs dimensional regularization. Simultaneous solutions of the ERG equations and Ward identities are considered. An approach to the study of bound states at long distances in the ERG is employed to describe the positronium. This is done by introducing a real scalar field which describes that bound state. The flow equations are studied using an effective action ansatz and a low-momentum expansion.</description>

      <title>New avenues for the neutrino dipole portal exploration at the energy frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and gauge-invariant study of the neutrino dipole portal at the energy frontier. Assuming negligible active-sterile mixing, we analyze sterile neutrino production via dimension-6 dipole operators coupling to the electroweak field strengths. The analysis incorporates, for the first time, both single- and double-gauge-boson effective interactions. We investigate novel collider signatures at the HL-LHC, the FCC-hh -- studied here in this context for the first time -- and a 10 TeV muon collider. Particular emphasis is placed on electroweak boson-initiated processes, which dominate in the high-mass regime above $\sim$1 TeV. At the muon collider, these VBF-like topologies enable production even when the dipole couples to non-muonic flavors, offering a unique and sensitive probe for different flavor scenarios. We derive sensitivity projections for various theoretical benchmarks, reaching dipole couplings down to $d_{\gamma}\sim 6\times10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at FCC-hh and $d_{\gamma}\sim 2\times10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at the muon collider.</description>

Abstract: We establish constraints on the dimension-six four-heavy-quark operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) by synthesising LHC measurements of top-quark and single-Higgs production with electroweak precision observables. We scrutinise the choice of the $\gamma_5$ scheme in single-Higgs calculations, demonstrating its non-negligible impact on SMEFT fits.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Standard Model Higgs physics: Hunting $h \rightarrow bs$ with Higgs-strahlung at CEPC and FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of $e^{-}e^{+}$ colliders, particularly the CEPC and FCC-ee, will offer unprecedented precision to probe Higgs boson properties. In this work, we investigate the flavor-changing decay $h \rightarrow bs$ produced via Higgs-strahlung in the framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model of Type III (2HDM-III). Using multivariate techniques, we project the signal significance for CEPC and FCC-ee, considering dominant backgrounds and systematic uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that these colliders could achieve $5\sigma$ sensitivity to $\text{BR}(h \rightarrow bs)$ down to $10^{-4}$, providing a unique window into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A Frequentist Simulation-Based Inference Treatment of Sterile Neutrino Global Fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical challenge in particle physics is combining results from diverse experimental setups that measure the same physical quantity to enhance precision and statistical power, a process known as a global fit. Global fits of sterile neutrino searches, hunts for additional neutrino oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, present an intriguing case study. In such a scenario, the key assumptions underlying Wilks' theorem, a cornerstone of most classic frequentist analyses, do not hold. The method of Feldman and Cousins, a trials-based approach which does not assume Wilks' theorem, becomes computationally prohibitive for complex or intractable likelihoods. To bypass this limitation, we borrow a technique from simulation-based inference (SBI) to estimate likelihood ratios for use in building trials-based confidence intervals, speeding up test statistic evaluations by a factor $&gt;10^4$ per grid point, resulting in a faster, but approximate, frequentist fitting framework. Applied to a subset of sterile neutrino search data involving the disappearance of muon-flavor (anti)neutrinos, our method leverages machine learning to compute frequentist confidence intervals while significantly reducing computational expense. In addition, the SBI-based approach holds additional value by recognizing underlying systematic uncertainties that the Wilks approach does not. Thus, our method allows for more robust machine learning-based analyses critical to performing accurate but computationally feasible global fits. This allows, for the first time, a global fit to sterile neutrino data without assuming Wilks' theorem. While we demonstrate the utility of such a technique studying sterile neutrino searches, it is applicable to both single-experiment and global fits of all kinds.</description>

      <title>Flux of Extragalactic Dark Matter in Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of extragalactic dark matter to the local dark matter density and flux in the Milky Way. By analyzing the Galactic escape velocity as a function of direction, we establish the criterion for separating dark matter particles bound to the Milky Way and those originating from the Local Group environment. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of dark matter particles in the Solar neighborhood have an extragalactic origin, contributing nearly 38% of the total mass flux. The directional dependence of this extragalactic component shows significant anisotropy across the sky, with implications for direct detection experiments. We provide quantitative predictions for detection rates and signatures that could help identify the extragalactic dark matter component in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating decay of true muonium: $\boldsymbol{(\mu^+ \mu^-) \to \mu^\pm e^\mp}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new channel for probing charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV): the decay of true muonium into a lepton pair of different flavor, $(\mu^+ \mu^-) \to \mu^\pm e^\mp$. This purely leptonic two-body decay provides a clean experimental signature in the form of energetic, oppositely charged leptons. It is sensitive not only to photonic dipole interactions but also to four-fermion contact interactions, and is free from hadronic uncertainties in theoretical predictions. We evaluate the branching ratios induced by scalar-, vector-, and dipole-type CLFV operators. Our results show that the branching ratio can reach up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ within current experimental bounds. Such a decay may be observable at future high-luminosity muon beamlines or at dedicated $e^+e^-$ or $\mu^+\mu^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>Study of $\tau\rightarrow e M^+ M^-$ decays in the N-B-LSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the next to the minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a local B-L gauge symmetry (N-B-LSSM), we study lepton flavor violating (LFV) $\tau\rightarrow e M^+ M^-$ decays: $\tau \rightarrow e \pi^+\pi^-$,~$\tau \rightarrow e \pi^+K^-$,~$\tau \rightarrow e K^+K^-$. According to the latest experimental data, the influence of different sensitive parameters on the branching ratios is considered. It can be seen from the numerical analysis that the main sensitive parameters and LFV sources are non-diagonal elements corresponding to the initial and final leptons. This work can provide a basis for discovering the existence of new physics (NP).</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic form factors of $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^0 \to \Lambda$ transition in the timelike region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $e^+e^-\to \Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$ and $e^+e^-\to \Lambda\bar{\Sigma}^0$ reactions within the extended vector meson dominance model. In addition to the ground state mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$, we consider the contributions of the excited states $\rho(3D)$, $\omega(3D)$, $\phi(3D)$, and $\rho(6D)$. It is found that the current experimental data on the $\Sigma$ electromagnetic form factors in timelike region can be well reproduced. And the $\phi(3D)$ resonance is essential to the near threshold enhancement of the cross section for the $e^+e^-\to \Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$ reaction. Furthermore, in the $e^+e^-\to \Lambda\bar{\Sigma}^0$ reaction, the $\rho(3D)$ is important to get a good fit for the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Parton-shower and fixed-order QCD effects in Higgs-boson production in weak-boson fusion and its decays to bottom quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was observed [arXiv:2407.09363] that an aggressive cut on the $b$-jets' transverse momenta applied to Higgs-boson production in weak-boson fusion followed by the decay $H \to b \bar b$, leads to very large QCD corrections to the fiducial cross section. In this paper we show that these corrections are caused by soft and collinear QCD radiation and, therefore, can be efficiently treated by a parton shower. We combine the parton-shower description of the decay $H \to b \bar b$ with NNLO QCD corrections to Higgs production in weak-boson fusion and its subsequent decay, and demonstrate that the quality of the theoretical prediction is markedly improved even if $b$-jets with rather high transverse momenta are selected. The remaining uncertainty of the theoretical prediction, mainly driven by imprecise modelling of $H \to b \bar b$ decay, is estimated to be of the order of $\mathcal{O}(5{-}7\%)$.</description>

      <title>A Factorized Mass Structure of Fermions and Its Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the mass matrix, a challenging problem in the Standard Model, is closely related to flavor phenomenology and the understanding of the Yukawa interaction. We derive a factorized mass structure based on observed fermion mass hierarchies, investigating the role of $SO(2)^f$ family symmetry in explaining the approximate degeneracy of light quark generations and its connection to flavor mixing. Our calculation includes the slightest modification from the lightest fermions by $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ hierarchy corrections. Using this model-independent framework, we systematically analyze all mass patterns and perform comprehensive fits to both quark CKM and lepton PMNS mixing data with extended normal-ordered Dirac neutrinos. The results demonstrate this framework's capacity to unify flavor phenomena while simultaneously providing new insights into the fundamental nature of Yukawa interactions.</description>

      <title>Gluon Distributions in the Pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a light-front model for the pion that explicitly incorporates the gluonic degree of freedom. In this framework, high-energy scattering off the pion is described by an active gluon, while the remaining constituents are treated as a spectator system with an effective mass. The mass spectrum and light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion are determined by solving two Schr\"odinger-like equations derived from quantum chromodynamics: the light-front holographic equation in the chiral limit and the 't~Hooft equation. Using the resulting LFWFs, we compute the gluon distributions within pion, including the parton distribution functions in comparison with the available global fits, generalized parton distributions, and transverse momentum-dependent distributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the obtained LFWFs provide a good description of the gravitational form factors of pion when compared with the recent lattice QCD results.</description>

Abstract: We study for the first time the transverse momentum transfer distributions $d\sigma/dt$ in coherent production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions within the QCD color dipole approach based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This allows us to treat properly the color transparency effects, as well as the higher and leading-twist shadowing corrections associated with the $|Q\bar Q\rangle$ and $|Q\bar QnG\rangle$ Fock components of the photon. While the multi-gluon photon fluctuations represent the dominant source of nuclear shadowing at kinematic regions related to the recent LHC and its future upgrade to LHeC, the upcoming electron-ion collider at RHIC will additionally require the proper incorporation of reduced quark shadowing. The latter effect leads to a significant decrease in the differential cross sections $d\sigma/dt$ compared to standard calculations based on the eikonal form for the dipole-nucleus amplitude. The leading-twist shadowing corrections, corresponding to a non-linear QCD evolution of a partial dipole-nucleus amplitude, reduce substantially charmonium $t$-distributions in the LHeC energy range. We predict a non-monotonic energy dependence of $d\sigma/dt$ suggesting so possible gluon saturation effects with increased onset at larger $t$-values. In addition to shadowing corrections, we study how the color transparency effects affect the shape of $t$-dependent nuclear modification factor. We also briefly discuss several aspects that can modify the charmonium production rate and thus may have a large impact on the search for gluon saturation effects.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hot SM, Magnetic Flux &amp; Baryogenesis from Helicity Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the electroweak crossover of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe, focusing on the interplay between generalized global symmetries, magnetic flux dynamics, and baryogenesis. Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure -- including higher-form and magnetic symmetries -- and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of Non-extensive Parameters in Au-Au Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a Bayesian statistical framework is employed to analyze particle yield ratios in Au-Au collisions, utilizing Non-Extensive Statistics (NES). Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, we systematically estimate key parameters, including the non-extensive factor $q$, temperature $T$, and chemical potential $\mu$. Our analysis confirms previous findings highlighting the suitability and robustness of Bayesian methods in describing heavy-ion collision data. A subsequent Bayes factor analysis does not provide definitive evidence favoring an Excluded Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (EV-HRG) model over the simpler NES approach. Overall, these results suggest that combining NES with Bayesian inference can effectively model particle distributions and improve parameter estimation accuracy, demonstrating the potential of this approach for future studies on relativistic nuclear interactions.</description>

      <title>Precision determination of $\alpha_\text{s}$ from Dijet Cross Sections in the Multi-TeV Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk we present a determination of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_\text{s}$ and its energy-scale dependence based on a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD analysis of dijet production. Using the invariant mass of the dijet system to probe $\alpha_\text{s}$ at different scales, we extract a value of $\alpha_\text{s}(m_\text{Z})=0.1178 \pm 0.0022$ from LHC dijet data. The combination of various LHC datasets significantly extends the precision and scale reach of the analysis, enabling the first determination of $\alpha_\text{s}$ up to 7 TeV. By incorporating dijet cross sections from HERA, we further probe $\alpha_\text{s}$ at smaller scales, covering a kinematic range of more than three orders of magnitude. Our results are in excellent agreement with QCD predictions based on the renormalization group equation, providing a stringent test of the running of the strong coupling across a wide energy range.</description>

      <title>Extending the sensitivity of heavy sterile neutrino searches with solar neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sensitivity study of the search for heavy sterile neutrinos ($\nu_H$) in the MeV mass range using solar neutrino experiments is presented. $\nu_H$, with masses ranging from a few MeV up to 15 MeV, can be produced in the Sun through $^8$B decay and subsequently decay into $\nu_e e^+ e^-$. Its flux and lifetime strongly depend on the mixing parameter $|U_{eH}|^2$ and mass $m_{\nu_H}$. The $\nu_H$ signal can be detected via its decay products, either the $e^+e^-$ pair or $\nu_e$, depending on whether $\nu_H$ decays inside or outside the detector. Expected signal yields for both detection methods (detecting $e^+e^-$ or $\nu_e$ signal) are presented across the full $|U_{eH}|^2$ and $m_{\nu_H}$ parameter space. These two methods are found to be complementary in different regions of the $|U_{eH}|^2$ and $m_{\nu_H}$ phase space. By combining both approaches, we anticipate observing at least a handful of signal events across most of the parameter space of $10^{-6} &lt; |U_{eH}|^2 &lt; 1$ and 2 MeV $&lt; m_{\nu_H} &lt; $ 14 MeV, assuming a 500-ton solar neutrino experiment operating for one year. Key variables, such as the energy spectra of $\nu_e$ or $e^+e^-$ and the $\nu_e$ solar angle, are also discussed to help distinguish signal from major backgrounds, such as solar neutrino events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the connection of the global properties of the SM gauge group to 1-form discrete symmetries, the possible non-Abelian embeddings of the SM group, and electric and magnetic charge quantisation. Building on previous work, we introduce indexes to characterise the group choices, connect the concept of compositeness degree to emergent electric 1-form symmetry, introduce a new model to fill in the $p=1$ gap, and analyse the magnetic spectrum while connecting its UV and IR realisations.</description>

      <title>Pentaquarks made of light quarks and their admixture to baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our studies of multiquark hadrons. The anti-symmetrization of their wavefunctions required by Fermi statistics is nontivial, as it mixes orbital, color, spin and flavor structures. In our previous papers we developed a method to find them based on the representations of the permutation group, and derived the explicit wave functions for baryons excited to the first and second shells $(L=1,2)$, tetraquarks $qq\bar q\bar q$ and hexaquarks ($6q$). Now we apply it
  to light pentaquarks ($qqqq\bar q$), in the S- and P-shells ($L=0,1$). Using Jacobi coordinates, one can use the hyperdistance approximation in
  12-dimensional space. We further address the issue of ``unquenching" of baryons, by considering their mixing with pentaquarks, via two channels, through the addition of $\sigma$-like or $\pi$-like $\bar q q$ pairs. This mixing is central for understanding of the observed flavor asymmetry of the antiquark sea, the amount of orbital motion issue as well as other nucleon properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle-II experiment has recently reported the first measurement of $B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar{\nu}$ decay which exceeds the Standard Model prediction by approximately 2.7$\sigma$. The deviation may indicate the presence of new physics beyond the Standard Model in the $b\to s\nu\bar{\nu}$ sector. Under this assumption, we study the hadronic $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda(\to p\pi)\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda^\ast(\to N\!\bar{K})\nu\bar{\nu}$ decays within both the Standard Model and beyond. We work in a low energy effective field theory framework with additional light right-handed neutrinos. We calculate the differential branching ratios of these decay modes and explore the implications of the Belle-II results through various observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After briefly touching on relativistic hydrodynamics, we provide a detailed description of recent developments in spin hydrodynamics. We discuss the theory of perfect spin hydrodynamics within two different approaches, which lead to identical generalized thermodynamic relations. We also indicate the applicability range of the theory, finding it compatible with the conditions existing in the late stages of heavy-ion collisions. Finally, we discuss the near-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-body decays \(\Lambda_b \to D^+ D^- \Lambda,~D^0D_s^- p,~D_s^+D_s^-\Lambda\), considering both internal and external emission mechanisms that produce various meson-baryon final states. Using a unitarized coupled-channel approach based on the local hidden gauge formalism, we analyze final state interactions in the exotic anticharm systems with strangeness \(S=-1\) and \(S=-2\). Significant threshold enhancements appear in both pseudoscalar and vector meson-baryon channels, indicating strong final state interactions and the possible formation of molecular exotic states below threshold. These features remain stable under variations of model parameters. Our results provide valuable insights into heavy hadron decay dynamics and offer theoretical guidance for future experimental searches of open-charm strange exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>$E_6$ Unification of Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis in an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Probing CP and flavor violation in neutral kaon decays with ALPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the three-body decays of the long-lived neutral kaon $K_L \to \pi\pi a$, where $a$ is an axion-like particle (ALP), and compare them to the two-body decay $K_L \to \pi^0 a$. While the latter requires both flavor violation (FV) and $CP$ violation (CPV), the former can proceed via FV alone, allowing the ratio of decay rates to serve as a probe of CPV of the underlying UV theory. We emphasize the importance of weak-interaction-induced contributions, often neglected in recent calculations. We explore both minimal and non-minimal flavor-violating scenarios, and identify classes of models where ALP production from neutral three-body decays is comparable to - or even dominates over - the two-body decay, despite its reduced phase space. Finally, we discuss the phenomenological implications of our results and show how these decays can provide complementary probes of ALP couplings beyond those accessible via charged kaon channels.</description>

      <title>Sub-keV dark matter can strongly ionize molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ionization of dense molecular clouds can be used to set strong constraints on dark matter models producing UV/X-ray photons in their annihilation or decay. We place robust and competitive constraints on various dark matter models, such as axion-like particles, scalars and sterile neutrinos, for masses between $\sim30$~eV and $10$~keV, and project forecasts to illustrate the potential of this target. We discuss how these constraints can be significantly improved by considering a more refined sample of molecular clouds near the Galactic Center and above the Galactic plane, a detailed modeling of the cosmic-ray ionization contribution and, potentially, a more refined analysis of the gas density in clouds through dust extinction maps. Thus, ionization of molecular clouds emerges as one of the most powerful tools for probing sub-keV dark matter.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Simulation of QED in Coulomb Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider background fields within the gravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension (SME) in a cosmological setting. Our analysis is divided into two parts. The first part addresses the consistency of nondynamical backgrounds in scenarios where diffeomorphism invariance is explicitly broken. Focusing on gravitational systems that admit Killing vector fields and possess a priori symmetries, we demonstrate that potential discrepancies between Riemannian geometry and dynamical equations can be avoided. The second part presents a direct application of various techniques developed by decomposing the modified Einstein equations along normal and tangential directions of the (3+1) decomposition. We show that nondynamical backgrounds can lead to accelerated cosmological expansion without requiring a cosmological constant, thereby opening new avenues for interpreting dark energy.</description>

      <title>Effects of beyond-mean-field correlations on nuclear Schiff moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the nuclear Schiff moments of the diamagnetic atoms $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg, and $^{225}$Ra in multireference covariant density functional theory. Beyond-mean-field correlations, arising from symmetry restoration and shape mixing, are incorporated via the generator coordinate method with projection onto states with well-defined parity, particle number, and angular momentum. Our results reveal a correlation between the contributions of nuclear intermediate states to Schiff moments and the electric dipole transition strengths from these states to the ground state. The new beyond-mean-field effects can either enhance or suppress the Schiff moments. In $^{225}$Ra, they do the latter, reducing the enhancement from octupole deformation somewhat.</description>

      <title>Slow Stable Self-bound Hybrid Star Can Relieve All Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii at the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of hybrid stars that are self-bound and radially stable in the slow phase transition context, and by some subsets even in the rapid phase transition context also. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of slow stable self-bound hybrid stars in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

      <title>Pion properties in isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter using in-medium chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the density dependence of in-medium pion properties, such as mass, wave function renormalization, and decay constant in the correlation function approach, and how they change under the influence of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. To this end, we use in-medium chiral perturbation theory to compute the relevant Feynman diagrams up to two-loop diagrams. Our results show that the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear matter splits these quantities into three separate values, corresponding to the three pions. Consequently, the tendency of each in-medium pion mass, wave function renormalization, and decay constant is dependent on the density and the neutron-to-proton ratio $\rho_n/\rho_p$ of nuclear matter. We also derive an in-medium Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation which is valid for isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter and investigate to what extent it holds within our calculations.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Physics Confronts Relativistic Collisions Of Isobars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy collisions involving the $A=96$ isobars $^{96}$Zr and $^{96}$Ru have been performed in 2018 at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as a means to search for the chiral magnetic effect in QCD. This would manifest itself as specific deviations from unity in the ratio of observables taken between $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr and $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru collisions. Measurements of such ratios (released at the end of 2021) indeed reveal deviations from unity, but these are primarily caused by the two collided isobars having different radial profiles and intrinsic deformations. To make progress in understanding RHIC data, nuclear physicists across the energy spectrum gathered in Heidelberg in 2022 as part of an EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force (RRTF) to address the following question. Does the combined effort of low-energy nuclear structure physics and high-energy heavy-ion physics enable us to understand the observations made in isobar collisions at RHIC?</description>

      <title>Numerical treatment of annual modulation of relic neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical treatment of the annual modulation of relic neutrinos due to the Sun's gravitational influence. Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.</description>

      <title>Toward graviton detection via photon-graviton quantum state conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations. We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework, allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.</description>

      <title>Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the computation of the C_T charge of the 2-point function of the Energy-Momentum Tensor to 4-loops. We show that C_T decomposes into two sectors, the conformal sector, which encodes the value of the central charge at fixed points and an RG-sector that contains logarithmic and constant corrections proportional to the beta-function. This latter constitutes the main new result of this work and is inaccessible via CFT methods alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that C_T satisfies an eigenvalue-like equation analogous to that of the spin-0 charge, as discussed in part I, though with a different in general eigenvalue. Finally we present three possible applications.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma &gt; 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma &gt; 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.</description>

Abstract: We provide a fully analytical approach to calculate the nonlinearities of the gravitational waves in the ringdown of a Kerr black hole in the eikonal limit. The corresponding quasi-normal modes are associated to the orbits of a closed circular null geodesic and the problem can be analyzed by taking the Penrose limit around it. We calculate analytically the amplitude and the phase of the quadratic quasi-normal modes as well as its dependence on the black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Universal lower bound on the axion decay constant from free streaming effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that enhancement of the axion relic abundance compared to the standard misalignment contribution generically leads to the production of nonzero momentum axion modes, resulting in warm dark matter behavior and enhanced isocurvature perturbations. It leads to universal constraints on the axion parameter space that are independent of detailed model assumptions and cosmological history. For models enhancing relic abundance with gradient axion modes, observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest impose a lower bound on the axion decay constant, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{15} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$, from the free-streaming effect. For models relying on the delay of coherent axion oscillations, we obtain a slightly weaker bound, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{14} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$. We make relatively conservative choices to establish these universal bounds but also provide scaling parameters that can be calibrated for stronger constraints in concrete models and updated as observations improve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11908v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we expand the scope of the JETSCAPE framework to investigate the dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, on the jet radius parameter ($R$) for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets extending up to 1 TeV to probe the quark-gluon plasma medium at much shorter distance scales. It focuses on quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed during Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, particularly for the most-central (0-10\%) collisions. Jet-medium interactions represent a pivotal domain of both theoretical and experimental QGP studies, with various models offering different assumptions to describe these phenomena. To illustrate this modular approach, this work computes the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets via coupling of the MATTER model (which simulates the high virtuality phase of the parton evolution) with the LBT model (which simulates the low virtuality phase of the parton evolution). Additionally, the two successful energy loss models: MARTINI and AdS/CFT are employed to characterize the jet-suppression effectively within the JETSCAPE framework. The results are compared with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors, covering jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$) ranging from 100 GeV to 1 TeV for ATLAS and 300 GeV to 1 TeV for CMS. The predictions made by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes, showing deviation within 10-25\%. Our major focus is on calculating the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet-R and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the experimental results align well with predictions from the JETSCAPE framework.</description>

Abstract: We discuss entanglement and the violation of the CGLMP inequality in a system of two vector bosons produced in the decay of a spin-0 particle. We assume the most general CPT conserving, Lorentz-invariant coupling of the spin-0 particle with the daughter bosons. We compute the most general two-boson density matrix obtained by averaging over kinematical configurations with an appropriate probability distribution (which can be obtained when both bosons subsequently decay into fermion-antifermion). We show that the two-boson state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constants and that in this case the state is entangled iff it can violate the CGLMP inequality. As an exemplary process of this kind we use the decay $H\to ZZ$ with anomalous coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A likelihood analysis of the observables in deeply virtual exclusive photoproduction off a proton target, $ep \rightarrow e' p' \gamma'$, is presented. Two processes contribute to the reaction: deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the photon is produced at the proton vertex, and the Bether-Heitler process, where the photon is radiated from the electron. We consider the unpolarized process for which the largest amount of data with all the kinematic dependences are available from corresponding datasets with unpolarized beams and unpolarized targets from Jefferson Lab. We provide and use a method which derives a joint likelihood of the Compton form factors, which parametrize the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude in QCD, for each observed combination of the kinematic variables defining the reaction. The unpolarized twist-two cross section likelihood fully constrains only three of the Compton form factors (CFFs). The impact of the twist-three corrections to the analysis is also explored. The derived likelihoods are explored using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Using our proposed method we derive CFF error bars and covariances. Additionally, we explore methods which may reduce the magnitude of error bars/contours in the future.</description>

      <title>Combination of aN$^3$LO PDFs and implications for Higgs production cross-sections at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how the two existing approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) sets of parton distributions (PDFs) from the MSHT20 and NNPDF4.0 series can be combined for LHC phenomenology, both in the pure QCD case and for the QCD$\otimes$QED sets that include the photon PDF. Using the resulting combinations, we present predictions for the total inclusive cross-section for Higgs production in gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production at the LHC Run-3. For the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion channels, the corrections that arise when using correctly matched aN$^3$LO PDFs with N$^3$LO cross section calculations, compared to using NNLO PDFs, are significant, in many cases larger than the PDF uncertainty, and generally larger than the differences between the two aN$^3$LO PDF sets entering the combination. The combined aN$^3$LO PDF sets, MSHT20xNNPDF40_an3lo and MSHT20xNNPDF40_an3lo_qed, are made publicly available in the LHAPDF format and can be readily used for LHC phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with one or more scalar multiplets beyond the Higgs doublet $\Phi$. The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of ALPs from $B$-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion-like particles (ALPs) through flavor changing neutral current processes, such as $B\to K a$ followed by $a\to\text{hadronic}, \gamma\gamma,\mu^+\mu^-$ channels. Our generic framework encompasses different ultraviolet scenarios similar to KSVZ, DFSZ and flavorful axions etc. Starting from the effective Lagrangian written at the high scale, we compute the anomalous dimension matrix, taking into account all one-loop and relevant two-loop contributions. The latter is most important for the KSVZ and heavy QCD axion scenarios. We recognized that such two-loop diagrams can have both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) divergences. We show explicitly that UV divergences cancel by inserting appropriate counterterms, which are new operators involving the axion field and required to be present at the UV itself, to renormalize the theory. On the other hand, the cancellation of IR divergences is subtle and demonstrated through matching with the effective theory at the electroweak scale. We also utilize chiral perturbation theory and vector meson dominance framework to compute the decay and branching fractions of the ALP pertaining to our framework. We find that for KSVZ-like scenario, axion decay constant, $f_a \lesssim 1$ TeV can be ruled out. The bound becomes stronger for the DFSZ and Flaxion-like models, reaching upto $10^4$ TeV and $10^6$ TeV, respectively. We also provide projections on the parameter space based on 3 ab$^{-1}$ data from Belle II and 300 fb$^{-1}$ data from LHCb.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dirac seesaw dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal Type-I Dirac seesaw which accommodates a thermal scalar dark matter (DM) candidate protected by a charge conjugation symmetry in dark sector $C_{\rm dark}$, without introducing any additional field beyond the ones taking part in the seesaw. A $Z_4$ symmetry is introduced to realise the tree level Dirac seesaw while the Majorana mass terms are prevented by an unbroken global lepton number symmetry. While the spontaneous $Z_4$ breaking together with electroweak symmetry breaking lead to the generation of light Dirac neutrino mass, it also results in the formation of domain walls. These cosmologically catastrophic walls can be made to annihilate away by introducing bias terms while also generating stochastic gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments like \texttt{LISA}, \texttt{BBO}, $\mu$-\texttt{ARES} etc. The scalar DM parameter space can be probed at direct and indirect search experiments. Light Dirac neutrinos also enhance the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The model can also explain the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: By using the \emph{Rydberg--Klein--Rees} (RKR) formulas to solve the inverse Schr\"{o}dinger problem, we found a confining bottom-up potential from a given eigenvalue spectrum. To illustrate this methodology, we consider the vector meson spectrum derived in the D3/D7 system as input data to derive the corresponding bottom-up confining potential that resembles the geometric structure of the so-called hardwall model. We compute some properties for this new bottom-up model, including the thermal deconfinement phase transition, the $\rho$ radial Regge trajectory, and the configurational entropy.</description>

Abstract: In the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model with n extra compactified dimensions, the gravitational potential scales as 1/r^{n+1} and becomes significantly stronger at short distances. We investigate the possibility of forming small-sized composite systems of Standard Model particles bound by this potential. Such bound states, composed of quarks, neutrinos, axions, or other particles, exhibit a small cross-section-to-mass ratio, making them viable candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of singly heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with heavy-quark dominance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rigorous calculation of the spin-orbit terms in the three-quark system is realized based on the Gaussian expansion method and the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions in the frame work of the relativized quark model, by ignoring the mixing between different excited states. Then, the complete mass spectra of the singly heavy baryons are obtained rigorously, under the mechanism of the heavy-quark dominance. On these bases, the systematical analyses are carried out for the reliability and predictive power of the model, the fine structure of the singly heavy baryon spectra, the assignments of the excited baryons, and some important topics about the heavy baryon spectroscopy such as the missing states, the `spin-orbit puzzle', the clustering effect, etc. The result confirms that under the heavy-quark dominance mechanism, the relativized quark model can describe the excitation spectra and the fine structures of the singly heavy baryons correctly and precisely.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the hadronization of parton showers using the HOMER method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We update the HOMER method, a technique to solve a restricted version of the inverse problem of hadronization -- extracting the Lund string fragmentation function $f(z)$ from data using only observable information. Here, we demonstrate its utility by extracting $f(z)$ from synthetic Pythia simulations using high-level observables constructed on an event-by-event basis, such as multiplicities and shape variables. Four cases of increasing complexity are considered, corresponding to $e^+e^-$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $90$ GeV producing either a string stretched between a $q$ and $\bar{q}$ containing no gluons; the same string containing one gluon $g$ with fixed kinematics; the same but the gluon has varying kinematics; and the most realistic case, strings with an unrestricted number of gluons that is the end-result of a parton shower. We demonstrate the extraction of $f(z)$ in each case, with the result of only a relatively modest degradation in performance of the HOMER method with the increased complexity of the string system.</description>

      <title>Mass and width of $T_{c\bar c}(4020)$ in the developed Bethe-Salpeter theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In experiments exotic meson resonance $T_{c\bar c}(4020)$ lies above the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold, and in principle one can not explain $T_{c\bar c}(4020)$ as a meson-meson bound state because meson-meson bound state must lie below the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold. In this work, exotic resonance $T_{c\bar c}(4020)$ is considered as an unstable meson-meson molecular state $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$, and the developed Bethe-Salpeter theory for dealing with unstable state is applied to investigate resonance $T_{c\bar c}(4020)$. We calculate the mass and width of unstable meson-meson molecular state $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory and find that this unstable meson-meson molecular state lies above the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold, which is consistent with experimental values of resonance $T_{c\bar c}(4020)$.</description>

Abstract: The femtoscopic $D \bar D $ correlations correlation functions are investigated to predict the signature of the not-yet-established $X(3700)$ state. Here it is interpreted as a bound state generated by solving the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equations with the local hidden-gauge formalism. We prospect how the relevant properties and observables characterizing this state -- like the pole position, scattering lengths and compositeness -- might be affected by the variation of the parameters of the model. The amplitudes are then used as input into the momentum correlation functions of the $D^0 \bar D^0$ and $D^+ D^- $ pairs. We discuss how their behaviors encode the features of the $X(3700)$ state.</description>

      <title>Characterizing CJPL's Site-Specific Neutrino Floor as the Neutrino Fog Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino floor, a theoretical sensitivity limit for dark matter (DM) direct detections, is being redefined as the boundary of a dynamic ``neutrino fog", where neutrino signals become inevitable, obscuring DM detection due to the statistical and systematic uncertainties. This study provides the first site-specific analysis of the neutrino floor at China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), leveraging its unique geographic and environmental characteristics. We quantify how CJPL's suppressed atmospheric neutrino flux (around 30\% lower than Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS)) reshapes the neutrino floor, thereby enabling improved sensitivity to high-mass WIMPs (mass $&gt;10 \rm GeV$). Using a gradient-based framework, we derive CJPL's neutrino floor and estimate the detection prospects for the PandaX-xT experiment. Our results demonstrate that a 500 tonne-year exposure with PandaX-xT could touch the floor, probing spin independent cross-section down to $\sigma_{n}\sim 3\times 10^{-49} \rm cm^2$ at a DM mass of 70 GeV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Implications of recent LHCb data on CPV in b-baryon four body decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent CPV observation, we investigate the CPV of b-baryon charmless four body decays under the U-spin symmetry. However, we find that only U-spin symmetry cannot provide effective predictions, particularly for $\Lambda_b$ decays. For giving more useful predictions, we also give a simple dynamic analysis. By counting the power($\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{\Lambda_{QCD}}{m_b}}$) of each topological diagram, we find that for the specific decay $B_b^2\to R(B_1^2 M^2 M^{\bar 2})M^2$, only one U-spin amplitude can contribute in the leading power, while for $B_b^2\to R(B_1^2 M^2)R( M^{\bar 2}M^2)$, only two U-spin amplitudes can contribute in this leading power. Then the most effective prediction can be given as \begin{align}
  &amp;A_{CP}^{dir}(\Lambda_b^0 \to R( p \pi^- \pi^+ )\pi^-) = (-12.99 \pm 2.83\pm2.59\pm0.65)\%,\notag \end{align} Considering the $\Lambda_b$ can effectively produced in LHCb, we strongly encourage a more precise experimental investigation of it.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles with multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be copiously produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers through nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung if the ALP-nucleon couplings $g_{a N}$ are sizable. The ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ may trigger conversions of ultralight ALPs into photons in the magnetic fields of the merger remnant and of the Milky Way. This effect would lead to a potentially observable short gamma-ray signal, in coincidence with the gravitational-wave signal produced during the merging process. This event could be detected through multi-messenger observation of BNS mergers employing the synergy between gravitational-wave detectors and gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we study the sensitivity of current and proposed MeV gamma-ray experiments to detect such a signal. As an explicit example, we consider ALP couplings related as in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) axion model, and show that in this case the proposed instruments can reach a sensitivity down to $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim \textrm{few} \times 10^{-13}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}$ eV, comparable with the SN 1987A limit.</description>

Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) soft function for a generic hadroproduction process involving massive colored particles is analytically calculated at the one-loop level, extended to higher orders in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$. We present both the azimuthal-angle-averaged and azimuthal-angle-dependent soft functions in impact-parameter space, making them suitable for small $q_T$ resummation calculations. Their analytic expressions are provided in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Our results offer essential ingredients for a complete higher-order perturbative calculation of the TMD soft function.</description>

      <title>Using the Virasoro conditions to revise the model of a quark-gluon string fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark-gluon string fragmentation is usually seen as a universal process with its physics remaining unchanged for different colliding systems and center-of-mass energy. However, there is a way to go beyond this assumption by considering the angular momentum of the fragmenting system. An accurate calculation of the spin of the string requires a specific definition of the initial state of the string. In this paper, I present a new method for defining the initial data for the Nambu-Goto relativistic string and derive the basics of its fragmentation process using the so-called Virasoro conditions. It is shown that very non-trivial consequences arise for non-zero mass strings, including the discrete spectrum of string spin, the discreteness of the possible string breaking points, the close-to-Regge behavior of the spin-mass relation for the light string fragments, and the natural stopping mechanism for fragmentation.</description>

Abstract: We present automated next-to-leading order QCD and/or electroweak (EW) predictions for photon-photon processes in ultraperipheral high-energy collisions of protons and ions, extending the capabilities of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework together in combination with the gamma-UPC code. Key aspects of this extension are discussed. We compute QCD and/or EW quantum corrections for several phenomenologically interesting processes at LHC and FCC-hh energies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling. We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package ``PySR" to model the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the flavor isovector combination $H_{u-d}(x,t,\xi)$ at $\xi=0$. These PySR models were trained on GPD results provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific physics hypotheses, including force-factorized $x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in a wide range in $x$ and $t$, crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic spatial distributions and their derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Q-balls Under Spontaneously Broken U(1) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of Q-balls under a spontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry. Q-balls are stabilized by the conservation of $U(1)$ charge, but when the symmetry is spontaneously broken, the resulting Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson can carry charge away from the Q-ball, potentially leading to charge leakage. To study this process in a controlled setting, we consider a scenario where Q-balls first form under an unbroken $U(1)$ symmetry, which is then spontaneously broken. We introduce two complex scalar fields: one responsible for forming the Q-ball, and the other for spontaneously breaking the $U(1)$ symmetry, allowing us to clearly separate the formation and symmetry-breaking phases. Using numerical simulations in a spherically symmetric system, we find that the evolution of Q-balls depends sensitively on the structure of the interaction between the two fields and the magnitude of symmetry breaking. Depending on parameters, Q-balls can completely decay, evaporate into smaller, stable Q-balls, or transition into oscillons/I-balls. In particular, we find that stable, localized remnants often survive the evolution over long timescales, especially when the symmetry-breaking scale is small. These results demonstrate that, even though spontaneous $U(1)$ breaking can lead to significant energy and charge loss from Q-balls, stable localized objects with reduced or no charge can frequently survive and potentially contribute to cosmological relics.</description>

      <title>New horizon in particle physics: first observation of CP violation in baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration achieved the observation of CP violation (CPV) in baryon decays through the process of $\Lambda_b^0\to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$, reporting an asymmetry of $(2.45\pm0.46\pm0.10)\%$ with a significance of 5.2$\sigma$. This marks a breakthrough and a milestone in particle physics, six decades after the first observation of CPV in mesons. It will be helpful to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In addition to the global CPV, local CPV is also observed by LHCb in the low mass region of $m_{p\pi^+\pi^-}&lt;2.7$GeV as $(5.4\pm0.9\pm0.1)\%$ with a significance of 6.0$\sigma$. Intriguingly, this measurement aligns well with a theoretical prediction of $(5.6-5.9)\%$ based on a CPV dynamics using the data of $N\pi\to p\pi^+\pi^-$ scatterings. Since baryons contain one more quark than mesons, the dynamics of baryon decays are significantly different from those of mesons. Therefore, the first observation of baryon CPV by LHCb opens a new horizon in the studies of dynamics of the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Different scenarios of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the interacting instanton liquid model via flavor symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a type of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\chi$SB) for various current quark masses using the interacting instanton liquid model. The type of D$\chi$SB is classified based on the sign of the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. We perform numerical simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model with the flavor SU(2) symmetric and (2+1)-flavor quarks. We find that the curvature is negative in the SU(2) case. This means the ordinary type of D$\chi$SB. In contrast, in the (2+1)-flavor case, a positive curvature is observed when the strange quark mass is as small as those of the up and down quarks. This suggests that the anomaly-driven type of D$\chi$SB can occur under the approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. As the strange quark mass increases, the curvature gradually decreases and becomes negative when the strange quark mass is approximately three times larger than those of the light quarks. This difference can be understood in terms of the 't Hooft vertex which induces a six-quark interaction in the $N_f=3$ case and does a four-quark interaction in the $N_f=2$ case. Our results might indicate that the ratio between the strange and light quark masses plays a crucial role in understanding the microscopic relationship between D$\chi$SB and the anomaly effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exotic baryon systems composed of anticharmed mesons and strange baryons using the extended local hidden gauge approach. By solving the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation with interaction kernels from vector meson exchange, we explore the formation of hadronic molecular states in sectors with strangeness $S = -1$, $-2$, $-3$ and $-4$. {We systematically consider all possible isospin configurations and include both octet and decuplet baryons in the coupled-channel systems.} \textcolor{black}{Our results indicate that attractive interactions in $S=-1,-2$ can dynamically generate bound states, while systems with $S=-3,-4$ have repulsive interactions and do not support molecular formation.} We also investigate vector-baryon systems with $\bar{D}^*$ and $\bar{D}_s^*$ mesons, finding similar but more deeply bound states. The results show that bound exotic states are more likely when one or two strange quarks are present. {To assess the robustness of our predictions, we perform an uncertainty analysis by varying the cutoff parameter \( q_{\text{max}} \), which affects the loop function regularization. The variations lead to moderate shifts in the pole positions, confirming the qualitative stability of the molecular states.} These results highlight the strangeness dependence of the molecular formation mechanism and provide theoretical predictions that can guide future experimental searches for exotic multistrange-anticharm baryon systems.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution) valid in realistic astrophysical environment, we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. Notably, the first-order study indicates that this photon cloud exists with no threshold for the coupling constant. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. Intriguingly, the induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling. Furthermore, in the near horizon region, the induced EM field has some overlap with the photon region as expected.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, the off-shell electromagnetic pion form factors in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism are considered. The separable kernel of the first rank quark-antiquark interaction is used to solve the equation analytically. The semi-off-shell pion form factors \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \), which are related to each other by the Ward-Takahashi identity, are calculated. The obtained off-shell form factors as well as static properties of the pion are compared with the results of other authors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate molecular states formed by bottom mesons and multistrange baryons from both octet and decuplet flavor representations, using the local hidden gauge approach combined with coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equations. Focusing on strangeness sectors \(S = -1\) to \(-4\), we predict several bound states in the \(S=-1, I=1/2,~3/2\) and \(S=-2, I=0\) sectors. No bound states are found in other isospin channels, where the interaction is repulsive, nor in higher strangeness sectors. The binding energies are analyzed under different values of the cutoff regularization parameters, providing estimates of theoretical uncertainties. This study provides concrete predictions to support future experimental investigations and improve understanding of heavy-flavor multistrange exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>A new approach to handling factorial moment correlations through principal component analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermittency analysis of factorial moments is a promising method used for the detection of power-law scaling in high-energy collision data. In particular, it has been employed in the search of fluctuations characteristic of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. However, intermittency analysis has been hindered by the fact that factorial moments measurements corresponding to different scales are correlated, since the same data are conventionally used to calculate them. This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents. We present a novel approach to intermittency analysis, employing the well-established statistical and data science tool of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique allows for the proper handling of correlations between scales without the need for subdividing the data sets available.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{\cal R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Neutrino Statistics from Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of neutrino statistical property on cosmology and the constraints imposed by cosmological data on neutrino statistics. Cosmological data from probes such as Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) radiation and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) are used to constrain the statistical parameter of neutrino. This constraint is closely related to the degeneracy effects among neutrino statistical property, the sum of neutrino masses, and the Hubble constant. Our results show that purely bosonic neutrinos can be ruled out at 95\% confidence level and purely fermionic neutrinos are preferred.</description>

      <title>PhyLiNO: A Forward-Folding Likelihood-Fit Framework for Neutrino Oscillation Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis of data from neutrino oscillation experiments. The framework performs a profile likelihood fit and employs a forward-folding technique to optimize its model with respect to the oscillation parameters. It is capable of simultaneously handling multiple datasets from the same or different experiments and their correlations. The code of the framework is optimized for performance and allows for convergence times of a few seconds handling hundreds of fit parameters, thanks to multi-threading and usage of GPUs. The framework was developed in the context of the Double Chooz experiment, where it was successfully used to fit three- and four-flavor models to the data, as well as in the measurement of the energy spectrum of reactor neutrinos. We demonstrate its applicability to other experiments by applying it to a study of the oscillation analysis of a medium baseline reactor experiment similar to JUNO.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for the moments of the binary collision integral and its relation to the relaxation-time approximation in leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the moments of the nonlinear binary collision integral in the ultrarelativistic hard-sphere approximation for an arbitrary anisotropic distribution function in the local rest frame. This anisotropic distribution function has an angular asymmetry controlled by the parameter of anisotropy $\xi$, such that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy $\lim_{\xi \rightarrow 0} \hat{f}_{0 \mathbf{k}} = f_{0 \mathbf{k}}$, approaches the spherically symmetric local equilibrium distribution function. The corresponding moments of the binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of different moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well defined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the moments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used relaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal distribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear Boltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the relaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two dynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the Boltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Topology and the Infrared Structure of Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infrared divergences in quantum electrodynamics using geometric phases and the adiabatic approximation in quantum field theory. In this framework, the asymptotic \textit{in} and \textit{out} states are modified by Berry phases, $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{in}}}$ and $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{out}}}$, which encode the infrared structure non-perturbatively and regulate soft-photon divergences.
  Unlike the Faddeev--Kulish formalism, which employs perturbative dressing with coherent states, our approach reformulates the effective action in terms of Berry connections in field space. This yields finite, gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes without requiring a sum over soft-photon emissions.
  We show that infrared divergences cancel to all orders in the bremsstrahlung vertex function $\Gamma^\mu(p_1, p_2)$, due to destructive interference among inequivalent Berry phases. As an application, we study the formation of positronium in the infrared regime and argue that the dressed \(S\)-matrix exhibits a functional singularity at $s = 4 m_e^2$, corresponding to a physical pole generated by topological flux.</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>
