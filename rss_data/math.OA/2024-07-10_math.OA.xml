      <title>Feynman-Kac perturbation of $C^*$ quantum stochastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of Feynman-Kac perturbation of quantum stochastic processes has a long pedigree, with the theory usually developed within the framework of processes on von Neumann algebras. In this work, the theory of operator spaces is exploited to enable a broadening of the scope to flows on $C^*$ algebras. Although the hypotheses that need to be verified in the general setting may seem numerous, we provide auxiliary results that enable this to be simplified in many of the cases which arise in practice. A wide variety of examples is provided by way of illustration.</description>

      <title>Hyperrigidity I: singly generated commutative $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hyperrigidity for singly generated unital commutative $C^*$-algebras. We provide four main approaches to hyperrigidity. The first is via operator-moment characterizations of spectral measures, the subject intensively exploited in quantum theory. The second approach is based on dilation theory and is written in terms of the Stone-von Neumann calculus for normal operators. The third, inspired by a recent result of L. G. Brown, concerns the weak and strong convergence of sequences of subnormal (or normal) operators. Finally, the fourth approach deals with the multiplicativity of unital completely positive maps on $C^*$-subalgebras generated by single normal elements. This is inspired by Petz's theorem and its generalizations established first by Arveson in the finite-dimensional case and then by L. G. Brown in general. The above machinery, together with sophisticated operator inequalities (Kadison's, Hansen's and Lieb-Ruskai's), makes it possible to identify certain subsets $G$ of the set $\{t^{*m}t^n\colon m, n = 0,1,2,\ldots\}$ that are hyperrigid in $C^*(t)$, the unital $C^*$-algebra generated by a single normal element $t$. Examples based on the Choquet boundary are included to confirm the optimality of our results.</description>

      <title>Weak*-Simplicity of Convolution Algebras on Discrete Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a discrete group $G$, and $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$, the algebra of $p$-convolution operators $CV_p(G)$ is weak*-simple, in the sense of having no non-trivial weak*-closed ideals, if and only if $G$ is an ICC group. This generalises the basic fact that $vN(G)$ is a factor if and only if $G$ is ICC. When $p=1$, $CV_p(G) = \ell^1(G)$. In this case we give a more detailed analysis of the weak*-closed ideals, showing that they can be described in terms of the weak*-closed ideals of $\ell^1(FC(G))$; when $FC(G)$ is finite, this leads to a classification of the weak*-closed ideals of $\ell^1(G)$.</description>
