      <title>Feature-free regression kriging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial interpolation is a crucial task in geography. As perhaps the most widely used interpolation methods, geostatistical models -- such as Ordinary Kriging (OK) -- assume spatial stationarity, which makes it difficult to capture the nonstationary characteristics of geographic variables. A common solution is trend surface modeling (e.g., Regression Kriging, RK), which relies on external explanatory variables to model the trend and then applies geostatistical interpolation to the residuals. However, this approach requires high-quality and readily available explanatory variables, which are often lacking in many spatial interpolation scenarios -- such as estimating heavy metal concentrations underground. This study proposes a Feature-Free Regression Kriging (FFRK) method, which automatically extracts geospatial features -- including local dependence, local heterogeneity, and geosimilarity -- to construct a regression-based trend surface without requiring external explanatory variables. We conducted experiments on the spatial distribution prediction of three heavy metals in a mining area in Australia. In comparison with 17 classical interpolation methods, the results indicate that FFRK, which does not incorporate any explanatory variables and relies solely on extracted geospatial features, consistently outperforms both conventional Kriging techniques and machine learning models that depend on explanatory variables. This approach effectively addresses spatial nonstationarity while reducing the cost of acquiring explanatory variables, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization ability. This finding suggests that an accurate characterization of geospatial features based on domain knowledge can significantly enhance spatial prediction performance -- potentially yielding greater improvements than merely adopting more advanced statistical models.</description>

      <title>The maximum proportion of spreaders in stochastic rumor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a general stochastic rumor model characterized by specific parameters that govern the interaction rates among individuals. Our model includes the \((\alpha, p)\)-probability variants of the well-known Daley--Kendall and Maki--Thompson models. In these variants, a spreader involved in an interaction attempts to transmit the rumor with probability \(p\); if successful, any spreader encountering an individual already informed of the rumor has probability \(\alpha\) of becoming a stifler. We prove that the maximum proportion of spreaders throughout the process converges almost surely, as the population size approaches~\(\infty\). For both the classical Daley--Kendall and Maki--Thompson models, the asymptotic proportion of the rumor peak is \(1 - \log 2 \approx 0.3069\).</description>

      <title>Deterministic simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate simplicial complexes deterministically growing from a single vertex. In the first step, a vertex and an edge connecting it to the primordial vertex are added. The resulting simplicial complex has a 1-dimensional simplex and two 0-dimensional faces (the vertices). The process continues recursively: On the $n$-th step, every existing $d-$dimensional simplex ($d\leq n-1$) joins a new vertex forming a $(d+1)-$dimensional simplex; all $2^{d+1}-2$ new faces are also added so that the resulting object remains a simplicial complex. The emerging simplicial complex has intriguing local and global characteristics. The number of simplices grows faster than $n!$, and the upper-degree distributions follow a power law. Here, the upper degree (or $d$-degree) of a $d$-simplex refers to the number of $(d{+}1)$-simplices that share it as a face. Interestingly, the $d$-degree distributions evolve quite differently for different values of $d$. We compute the Hodge Laplacian spectra of simplicial complexes and show that the spectral and Hausdorff dimensions are infinite. We also explore a constrained version where the dimension of the added simplices is fixed to a finite value $m$. In the constrained model, the number of simplices grows exponentially. In particular, for $m=1$, the spectral dimension is $2$. For $m=2$, the spectral dimension is finite, and the degree distribution follows a power law, while the $1$-degree distribution decays exponentially.</description>

      <title>When Dialects Collide: How Socioeconomic Mixing Affects Language Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The socioeconomic background of people and how they use standard forms of language are not independent, as demonstrated in various sociolinguistic studies. However, the extent to which these correlations may be influenced by the mixing of people from different socioeconomic classes remains relatively unexplored from a quantitative perspective. In this work we leverage geotagged tweets and transferable computational methods to map deviations from standard English on a large scale, in seven thousand administrative areas of England and Wales. We combine these data with high-resolution income maps to assign a proxy socioeconomic indicator to home-located users. Strikingly, across eight metropolitan areas we find a consistent pattern suggesting that the more different socioeconomic classes mix, the less interdependent the frequency of their departures from standard grammar and their income become. Further, we propose an agent-based model of linguistic variety adoption that sheds light on the mechanisms that produce the observations seen in the data.</description>

      <title>Emerging properties of the degree distribution in large non-growing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree distribution is a key statistical indicator in network theory, often used to understand how information spreads across connected nodes. In this paper, we focus on non-growing networks formed through a rewiring algorithm and develop kinetic Boltzmann-type models to capture the emergence of degree distributions that characterize both preferential attachment networks and random networks. Under a suitable mean-field scaling, these models reduce to a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation with an affine diffusion coefficient, that is consistent with a well-established master equation for discrete rewiring processes. We further analyze the convergence to equilibrium for this class of Fokker-Planck equations, demonstrating how different regimes -- ranging from exponential to algebraic rates -- depend on network parameters. Our results provide a unified framework for modeling degree distributions in non-growing networks and offer insights into the long-time behavior of such systems.</description>

      <title>The gradual transformation of inland areas -- human plowing, horse plowing and equity incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many modern areas have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by expected value and variance. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of complex contagions is shaped by a trade-off between reach and reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does social network structure amplify or stifle behavior diffusion? Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5% margin in only 22% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions. This pattern reflects a fundamental tradeoff: random ties enhance reach, while clustered ties enhance social reinforcement.</description>

      <title>Anomaly, Class Division, and Decoupling in Wealth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Economic inequality is driven by the structure of agent networks, interactions among agents, and the abilities of individual agents. We provide a comprehensive picture of anomalous diffusion, economic class division, and bimodal wealth distribution in an agent-based model, where heterogeneous agent abilities and growth rates are tuned on sparse regular networks. In particular, we focus on the statistical characteristics of logarithmic scaled normalized wealth distributions with two ability parameters, assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and concentration $\mathcal{R}$. For the set of $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R})$, temporal behaviors of log-wealth distributions reveal that the decoupling between different ability groups depends primarily on $\mathcal{R}$ and long-term inequality depends mainly on $\mathcal{A}$. In other words, class division and decoupling are driven by $\mathcal{R}$, while the super-diffusive nature in the leading class is driven by $\mathcal{A}$. Our findings highlight that hierarchical segregation of abilities, rather than ability differences alone, is a key driver of economic class stratification. Finally, our model provides a minimal, yet powerful framework for understanding the bimodal global income distribution observed over the past half century and highlights the critical role of network-level segregation in shaping economic inequality.</description>
