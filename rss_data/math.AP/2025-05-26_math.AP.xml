      <title>Compactness of the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the $C^0$ estimate for the $L_p$ $q$th dual Minkowski problem on $S^2$ under fairly general conditions; namely, when $p$ lies in [0,1) and $q&gt;2+p$, and the $L_p$ $q$th dual curvarture is bounded and bounded away from zero. We note that it is known that the analogous $C^0$ estimate does not hold if $p&lt;-1$ and $q=3$. As a corollary of our $C^0$ estimate, we deduce the uniqueness of the solution of the near isotropic $q$th $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem on $S^2$ if $q$ is close to 3 and the $q$th $L_p$ dual curvature is Holder close to be the constant one function.</description>

      <title>The Poisson's Problems on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem \[ \begin{cases} -\Delta_d u = \mu_0 &amp;\text{ in } G\\ u = 0 &amp;\text{ on } \partial G \end{cases} \] where, $\Delta_d$ represent the discret Laplacian, and $\mu_0$ it is a measure defined in the vertex of the graph $G=(V,E)$. Here $V$ defined the vertex of the graph, $E$ its edges and $\partial G$ its boundary. We prove that this problem has an unique solution by using an adaption of the Perron's method for the graphs by using an idea known as Balayage.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of a vertical oscillating Neumann condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We homogenize the Laplace and heat equations with the Neumann data oscillating in the ``vertical" $u$-variable. These are simplified models for interface motion in heterogeneous media, particularly capillary contact lines. The homogenization limit reveals a pinning effect at zero tangential slope, leading to a novel singularly anisotropic pinned Neumann condition. The singular pinning creates an unconstrained contact set, generalizing the contact set in the classical thin obstacle problem. We establish a comparison principle for the heat equation with this new type of boundary condition. The comparison principle enables a proof of homogenization via the method of half-relaxed limits from viscosity solution theory. Our work also demonstrates, for the first time in a PDE problem in multiple dimensions, the emergence of rate-independent pinning from gradient flows with wiggly energies. Prior limit theorems of this type, in rate-independent contexts, were limited to ODEs and PDEs in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter identification in systems of PDEs from internal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to present a general analysis of a class of inverse problems that consists in recovering the elliptic parameter maps in systems of PDEs, such as the linear elastic system, from the knowledge of some of their solutions. This identification problem is reformulated as a first-order linear system of the form $\nabla\bm{\mu} + \bm{B} \cdot \bm{\mu} = F$, where $F$ and $\g B$ are tensor fields constructed from the data. A closed range property is proved, which induces $L^2$-stability estimates. We then characterize the null space by introducing the concept of conservative third-order tensor field. Finally, a discretization based on the finite element method is proposed and some numerical examples show the efficiency of this approach to recover anisotropic elastic parameters from both static and dynamic solutions of the PDE system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of the pressureless Euler-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (with $d\geq 2$) in the critical regularity setting for a density close to $0$. We prove a global existence result for small data for this system, and then give optimal time decay estimates.</description>

      <title>Weak solution for granular model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to questions concerning the existence of solutions for partial differential equation problems modeling granular flows. The models studied take into account the complex threshold rheology of these flows, as well as the dilatance effects. It is the coupling of these two physical phenomena that ensures stability and the existence of dissipated energy. The key point of the article is to understand how this energy can ensure the existence of a weak solution. We first establish a complete result on a simplified model, then demonstrate how it can be extended to more general cases. This work represents a real breakthrough in the mathematical analysis of this type of models for complex flows.</description>

      <title>On an inverse dynamic problem for the wave equation with a potential on a real line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse dynamic problem for the wave equation with a potential on a real line. The forward initial-boundary value problem is set up with a help of boundary triplets. As an inverse data we use an analog of a response operator (dynamic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map). We derive equations of inverse problem and also point out the relationship between dynamic inverse problem and spectral inverse problem from a matrix-valued measure.</description>

      <title>One dimensional inverse problem in photoacoustic. Numerical testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstruction of Cauchy data for the wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^1$ by the measurements of its solution on the boundary of the finite interval. This is a one-dimensional model for the multidimensional problem of photoacoustics, which was studied in \cite{BLMM}. We adapt and simplify the method for one-dimensional situation and provide the results on numerical testing to see the rate of convergence and stability of the procedure. We also give some hints on how the procedure of reconstruction can be simplified in 2d and 3d cases.</description>

      <title>On the fragility of laminar flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inviscid laminar flow is a stationary solution of the incompressible Euler equations whose streamlines foliate the fluid domain. Their structure on symmetric domains is rigid: all laminar flows occupying straight periodic channels are shear and on regular annuli they are circular. Laminarity can persist to slight deformations of these domains provided the base flow is Arnold stable and non-stagnant (non-vanishing velocity). On the other hand, flows with trivial net momentum (and thus stagnate) break laminarity by developing islands (regions of contractible streamlines) on all non-flat periodic channels with up/down reflection symmetry. Here, we show that stable steady states occupying generic channels or annuli and stagnate must have islands. Additionally, when the domain is close to symmetric, we characterize the size of the islands, showing that they scale as the square root of the boundary's deviation from flat. Taken together, these results show that dynamically stable laminar flows are structurally unstable whenever they stagnate.</description>

Abstract: We study Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of-type theorems for functions $u$ in homogeneous De Giorgi classes, and we show that the maximum modulus $\mu_+(r)$ of $u$ has a power-like growth of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ when $r\to\infty$. By proper counterexamples, we show that in general we cannot expect $\alpha$ to be $1$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Fingering Patterns in $A + B \rightarrow C$ Reactive Porous Media Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convection-diffusion-reaction system governing incompressible reactive fluids in porous media is studied, focusing on the \( A + B \to C \) reaction coupled with density-driven flow. The time-dependent Brinkman equation describes the velocity field, incorporating permeability variations modeled as an exponential function of the product concentration. Density variations are accounted for using the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation, with density as a function of reactants and product concentration. The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions are established via the Galerkin approach, proving the system's well-posedness. A maximum principle ensures reactant nonnegativity with nonnegative initial conditions, while the product concentration is shown to be bounded, with an explicit upper bound derived in a simplified setting. Numerical simulations are performed using the finite element method to explore reactive fingering instabilities and illustrate the effects of density stratification, differential product mobility, and two- or three-dimensionality. Two cases with initial flat and elliptic interfaces further demonstrate the theoretical result that solutions continuously depend on initial and boundary conditions. These theoretical and numerical findings provide a foundation for understanding chemically induced fingering patterns and their implications in applications such as carbon dioxide sequestration, petroleum migration, and rock dissolution in karst reservoirs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse boundary value problem of the simultaneous determination of the coefficients $\sigma$ and $q$ of the equation $-\mbox{div}(\sigma \nabla u)+qu = 0$ from knowledge of the so-called Neumann-to-Dirichlet map, given locally on a non-empty curved portion $\Sigma$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ of a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, with $n\geq 3$. We assume that $\sigma$ and $q$ are \textit{a-priori} known to be a piecewise constant matrix-valued and scalar function, respectively, on a given partition of $\Omega$ with curved interfaces. We prove that $\sigma$ and $q$ can be uniquely determined in $\Omega$ from the knowledge of the local map.</description>

      <title>Primitive variable regularization to derive novel Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that employ a vertical velocity expansion and derive additional so-called moment equations for the expansion coefficients. Among desirable analytical properties for such systems of equations are hyperbolicity, accuracy, correct momentum equation, and interpretable steady states. In this paper, we show analytically that existing models fail at different of these properties and we derive new models overcoming the disadvantages. This is made possible by performing a hyperbolic regularization not in the convective variables (as done in the existing models) but in the primitive variables. Via analytical transformations between the convective and primitive system, we can prove hyperbolicity and compute analytical steady states of the new models. Simulating a dam-break test case, we demonstrate the accuracy of the new models and show that it is essential for accuracy to preserve the momentum equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit a class of optimal transport problems associated to non-autonomous linear control systems. Building on properties of the cost functions on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}$ derived from suitable variational problems, we show the equivalence between the static and dynamic versions of the corresponding transport problems. Our analysis is constructive in nature and relies on functional analytic properties of the end-point map and the fine properties of the optimal control functions. These lead to some new quantitative estimates which play a crucial role in our investigation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a one dimensional energy dissipating free boundary model with nonlinear boundary conditions. Existence of weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is part of a general study on the long-term safety of the geological repository of nuclear wastes. A diffusion equation with a moving free boundary in one dimension is introduced and studied. The model describes some mechanisms involved in corrosion processes at the surface of carbon steel canisters in contact with a claystone formation. The main objective of the paper is to prove the existence of weak solutions to the problem which are maximal in time. For this, a time semidiscrete minimizing movements scheme based on a Wasserstein-like distance is introduced. The existence of solutions to the scheme is proved. Then, using a priori estimates, it is shown that as the time step goes to zero these solutions converge up to extraction towards a maximal weak solution to the free boundary model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous stationary states that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath stationary state for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller than the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Boundary null controllability of a class of 2-d degenerate parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the boundary null controllability of some degenerate parabolic equations posed on a square domain, presenting the first study of boundary controllability for such equations in multidimensional settings. The proof combines two classical techniques: the method of moments and the Lebeau-Robbiano strategy. A key novelty of this work lies in the analysis of boundary control localized on a subset of the boundary where the degeneracy occurs. Furthermore, we establish the Kalman rank condition as a full characterization of boundary controllability for coupled degenerate systems. The results are extended to $N$-dimensional domains, and potential extensions and open problems are discussed to motivate further research in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a framework for approximating the obstacle problem through a penalty approach by nonlinear PDEs. By using tools from capacity theory, we show that derivatives of the solution maps of the penalised problems converge in the weak operator topology to an element of the strong-weak Bouligand subdifferential. We are able to treat smooth penalty terms as well as nonsmooth ones involving for example the positive part function $\max(0,\cdot)$. Our abstract framework applies to several specific choices of penalty functions which are omnipresent in the literature. We conclude with consequences to the theory of optimal control of the obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Orr-Sommerfeld equation and complex deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For shear flows in a 2D channel, we define resonances near regular values of the shear profile for the Rayleigh equation under an analyticity assumption. This is done via complex deformation of the interval on which Rayleigh equation is considered. We show such resonances are inviscid limits of the eigenvalues of the corresponding Orr--Sommerfeld equation.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Penrose inequality via Nonlinear Potential Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the Riemannian Penrose inequality for time-symmetric asymptotically flat initial data with a single black-hole horizon. The proof proceeds through a newly established monotonicity formula holding along the level sets of the $p$-capacitary potential of the horizon boundary, in any asymptotically flat $3$-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse optimal control of random elliptic variational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a risk-averse optimal control problem governed by an elliptic variational inequality (VI) subject to random inputs. By deriving KKT-type optimality conditions for a penalised and smoothed problem and studying convergence of the stationary points with respect to the penalisation parameter, we obtain two forms of stationarity conditions. The lack of regularity with respect to the uncertain parameters and complexities induced by the presence of the risk measure give rise to new challenges unique to the stochastic setting. We also propose a path-following stochastic approximation algorithm using variance reduction techniques and demonstrate the algorithm on a modified benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Existence and higher regularity of statistically steady states for the stochastic Coleman-Gurtin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of semi-linear differential Volterra equations with polynomial-type potentials that incorporates the effects of memory while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. We show that for a broad class of non-linear potentials, the system always admits invariant probability measures. However, the presence of memory effects precludes access to compactness in a typical fashion. In this paper, this obstacle is overcome by introducing functional spaces adapted to the memory kernels, thereby allowing one to recover compactness. Under the assumption of sufficiently smooth noise, it is then shown that the statistically stationary states possess higher-order regularity properties dictated by the structure of the nonlinearity. This is established through a control argument that asymptotically transfers regularity onto the solution by exploiting the underlying Lyapunov structure of the system in a novel way.</description>
