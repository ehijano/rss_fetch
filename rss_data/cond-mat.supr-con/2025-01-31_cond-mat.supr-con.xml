      <title>Chiral cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Topological Hinge States in the Higher-Order Topological Insulator WTe$_2$ Based on the Fractional Josephson Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a novel class of topological materials, characterised by the emergence of topological boundary modes at dimensions two or more lower than those of bulk materials. Recent experimental studies have identified conducting channels at the hinges of HOTIs, although their topological nature remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated Shapiro steps in Al-WTe$_2$-Al proximity Josephson junctions (JJs) under microwave irradiation and examined the topological properties of the hinge states in WTe$_2$. Specifically, we analysed the microwave frequency dependence of the absence of the first Shapiro step in hinge-dominated JJs, attributing this phenomenon to the 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship characteristic of topological JJs. These findings may encourage further research into topological superconductivity with topological hinge states in superconducting hybrid devices based on HOTIs. Such advances could lead to the realisation of Majorana zero modes for topological quantum physics and pave the way for applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian catalysis of density-wave orders on Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the lattice geometry, the nearest-neighbor (NN) tight-binding model for free fermions gives rise to particle-hole symmetric emergent Dirac liquid, Fermi liquid, and flat bands near the half-filling or zero-energy on bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices, respectively embedded on the flat and negatively curved spaces. Such noninteracting electronic fluids are characterized by a vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near half-filling, respectively. A non-Hermitian generalization of this scenario resulting from an imbalance of the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions between any pair of NN sites continues to accommodate a real eigenvalue spectrum over an extended non-Hermitian parameter regime. Most importantly, it reduces the band width without altering the characteristic scaling of the density of states close to the zero-energy. Here, we show that on two-dimensional bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a non-Hermiticity catalyzes the formation of both charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave orders at weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in conventional or Hermitian systems) NN Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions, respectively. These two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of average electronic density and spin between the NN sites, respectively, and both cause insulation in half-filled systems. We arrive at these conclusions by combining biorthogonal quantum mechanics and lattice-based self-consistent numerical mean-field analysis in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling of the associated mass gaps near the zero-energy with the non-Hermitian parameter, and also address the finite size scaling of the order parameters specifically on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions. A robust general mathematical criterion for the proposed non-Hermitian catalysis mechanism for ordered phases is showcased.</description>

      <title>Cascade switching current detectors based on arrays of Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cascade multiplication is a common technique to enhance the sensitivity of photon detectors. In this study, we demonstrate novel cascade-amplified superconducting detectors utilizing arrays of Josephson junctions. The mutual coupling between junctions induces avalanche-like switching of multiple junctions upon photon absorption, leading to cascade amplification of the readout voltage. We present two prototypes featuring either low-Tc linear Nb/NbxSi1-x/Nb arrays, or high-Tc stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Both devices exhibit clear antenna effects in microwave directivities, indicating good impedance matching and absorption efficiency. The combination of high absorption efficiency and large cascade amplification has the potential to produce broadband THz sensors with sensitivity exceeding 10^13 V/W.</description>

      <title>Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the bias current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is formulated under the bias current using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. The bias current shifts the Fermi momentum in the Rashba system due to the continuity of the electronic current. Including the shift of Fermi momentum in the coupling energy, it is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device.</description>

      <title>Conditions for orbital-selective altermagnetism in Sr2RuO4: tight-binding model, similarities with cuprates, and implications for superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spin-Triplet Pairing in Heavy Nuclei is Stable Against Deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any experimental evidence of nucleons paired in spin-triplet states will confirm the existence of an exotic phase of nuclear matter. This type of nuclear superfluidity has been hypothesized in heavy nuclei, where the antagonizing spin-orbit effects are damped, and there it oftentimes coexists with traditional spin-singlet pairing, leading to the possibility of mixed-spin pairing. Realistic nuclear deformation, not considered in such studies, could make-or-break these proposals, since its effect on triplet-pairing, and the competition (and coexistence) of the two superfluid phases, was expected to be crucial. We report on a thorough study on the effect of deformation on triplet-, singlet-, and mixed-spin pairing in the relevant region of the nuclear chart. We find that, at low isospin asymmetries, spin-triplet pairing is enhanced by deformation, while below the proton-drip line, the novel superfluid phase survives alongside the usual spin-singlet pairing. These results suggest that spin-triplet superfluidity exists in realistic nuclei and can be probed in the lab.</description>

      <title>Josephson currents in neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the interface between $S$-wave and $P$-wave paired superfluids in neutron stars induces a neutron supercurrent, a charge-neutral analog of the Josephson junction effect in electronic superconductors. The proton supercurrent entrainment by the neutron superfluid generates, in addition to the neutral supercurrent, a charged current across the interface. Beyond this stationary effect, the motion of the neutron vortex lines responding to secular changes in the neutron star's rotation rate induces a time-dependent oscillating Josephson current across this interface when proton flux tubes are dragged along with them. We show that such motion produces radiation from the interface once clusters of proton flux tubes intersect the interface. The power of radiation exceeds by orders of magnitude the Ohmic dissipation of currents in neutron stars. This effect appears to be phenomenologically significant enough to heat the star and alter its cooling rate during the photon cooling era.</description>

      <title>Space-Time-Coupled Qubits for Enhanced Superconducting Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</description>
