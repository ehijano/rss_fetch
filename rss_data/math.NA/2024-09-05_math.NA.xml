      <title>Nonlinear Monolithic Two-Level Schwarz Methods for the Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear domain decomposition methods became popular in recent years since they can improve the nonlinear convergence behavior of Newton's method significantly for many complex problems. In this article, a nonlinear two-level Schwarz approach is considered and, for the first time, equipped with monolithic GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse basis functions for the Navier-Stokes equations. Results for lid-driven cavity problems with high Reynolds numbers are presented and compared with classical global Newton's method equipped with a linear Schwarz preconditioner. Different options, for example, local pressure corrections on the subdomain and recycling of coarse basis functions are discussed in the nonlinear Schwarz approach for the first time.</description>

      <title>On the backward stability of s-step GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication, i.e., data movement, is a critical bottleneck for the performance of classical Krylov subspace method solvers on modern computer architectures. Variants of these methods which avoid communication have been introduced, which, while equivalent in exact arithmetic, can be unstable in finite precision. In this work, we address the backward stability of s-step GMRES, also known as communication-avoiding GMRES. We present a framework for simplifying the analysis of s-step GMRES, which includes standard GMRES (s=1) as a special case, by isolating the effects of rounding errors in the QR factorization and the solution of the least squares problem. Using this framework, we analyze s-step GMRES with popular block orthogonalization methods: block modified Gram--Schmidt and reorthogonalized block classical Gram--Schmidt algorithms. An example illustrates the resulting instability of s-step GMRES when paired with the classical s-step Arnoldi process and shows the limitations of popular strategies for resolving this instability. To address this issue, we propose a modified Arnoldi process that allows for much larger block size s while maintaining satisfactory accuracy, as confirmed by our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On Advanced Monte Carlo Methods for Linear Algebra on Advanced Accelerator Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present computational experiments with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Matrix Inversion ($(\text{MC})^2\text{MI}$) on several accelerator architectures and investigate their impact on performance and scalability of the method. The method is used as a preconditioner and for solving the corresponding system of linear equations iterative methods, such as generalized minimal residuals (GMRES) or bi-conjugate gradient (stabilized) (BICGstab), are used.
  Numerical experiments are carried out to highlight the benefits and deficiencies of both approaches and to assess their overall usefulness in light of scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>Approximation and application of minimizing movements for surface PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the closest point method, we extend the applicability of minimizing movements to the surface PDE setting. The corresponding approximation methods are created, and their convergence is observed. The numerical methods are then used to develop threshold dynamics algorithms for surface-constrained interfacial motions. In particular, show how the minimizing movements enable one to approximate multiphase, volume-preserving, curvature flows on surfaces via generalized MBO and HMBO algorithms.</description>

      <title>A priori and a posteriori error bounds for the fully mixed FEM formulation of poroelasticity with stress-dependent permeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a family of mixed finite element methods for a model of nonlinear poroelasticity where, thanks to a rewriting of the constitutive equations, the permeability depends on the total poroelastic stress and on the fluid pressure and therefore we can use the Hellinger--Reissner principle with weakly imposed stress symmetry for Biot's equations. The problem is adequately structured into a coupled system consisting of one saddle-point formulation, one linearised perturbed saddle-point formulation, and two off-diagonal perturbations. This system's unique solvability requires assumptions on regularity and Lipschitz continuity of the inverse permeability, and the analysis follows fixed-point arguments and the Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi theory. The discrete problem is shown uniquely solvable by applying similar fixed-point and saddle-point techniques as for the continuous case. The method is based on the classical PEERS$_k$ elements, it is exactly momentum and mass conservative, and it is robust with respect to the nearly incompressible as well as vanishing storativity limits. We derive a priori error estimates, we also propose fully computable residual-based a posteriori error indicators, and show that they are reliable and efficient with respect to the natural norms, and robust in the limit of near incompressibility. These a posteriori error estimates are used to drive adaptive mesh refinement. The theoretical analysis is supported and illustrated by several numerical examples in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Constrained mock-Chebyshev least squares approximation for Hermite interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of function approximation using Hermite interpolation on equally spaced nodes. In this setting, standard polynomial interpolation suffers from the Runge phenomenon. To mitigate this issue, we propose an extension of the constrained mock-Chebyshev least squares approximation technique to Hermite interpolation. This approach leverages both function and derivative evaluations, resulting in more accurate approximations. Numerical experiments are implemented in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Free convection in fractured porous media: a numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to better understand the influence of fractures on the possibility of free convection in porous media. To this aim, we introduce a mathematical model for density driven flow in the presence of fractures, and the corresponding numerical approximation. In addition to the direct numerical solution of the problem we propose and implement a novel method for the assessment of convective stability through the eigenvalue analysis of the linearized numerical problem. The new method is shown to be in agreement with existing literature cases both in simple and complex fracture configurations. With respect to direct simulation in time, the results of the eigenvalue method lack information about the strength of convection and the steady state solution, they however provide detailed (quantitative) information about the behavior of the solution near the initial equilibrium condition. Furthermore, not having to solve a time-dependent problem makes the method computationally very efficient. Finally, the question of how the porous matrix interacts with the fracture network to enable free convection is examined: the porous matrix is shown to be of key importance in enabling convection for complex fracture networks, making stability criteria based on the fracture network alone somewhat limited in applicability.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtue surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>

      <title>A thermo-flow-mechanics-fracture model coupling a phase-field interface approach and thermo-fluid-structure interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geothermal energy, a promising renewable source, relies on efficiently utilizing geothermal reservoirs, especially in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), where fractures in hot rock formations enhance permeability. Understanding fracture behavior, influenced by temperature changes, is crucial for optimizing energy extraction. To address this, we propose a novel high-accuracy phase-field interface model integrating temperature dynamics into a comprehensive hydraulic-mechanical approach, aiming for a thermo-fluid-structure interaction representation. Therein, the key technical development is a four-step algorithm. This consists of computing the fracture width, reconstructing the sharp interface geometry, solving the thermo-fluid-structure interaction (TFSI) problem, and employing a phase-field approach coupled to the temperature and pressure from the TFSI problem. By coupling temperature-hydraulic-mechanical processes with our newly proposed high-accuracy phase-field interface approach, we investigate how temperature impacts fracture width values, which are crucial for permeability in EGS reservoirs. Through this model and three different numerical simulations, we aim to provide an approach to deepen understanding of the complex interplay between temperature, mechanical deformation, and permeability evolution. Therein, we substantiate our formulations and algorithms through mesh convergence results of crack width and total crack volumes for static fractures, and crack lengths in the case of propagating fractures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying a model for molecular motors responsible for the bending of the axoneme in the flagella of microorganisms. The model is a coupled system of partial differential equations inspired by J\"ulicher et al. or Camalet, incorporating two rows of molecular motors between microtubules filaments. Existence and uniqueness of a solution is proved, together with the presence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results. A brief study on the generalization to N-rows is also included.</description>

      <title>Meshless quadrature formulas arising from numerical differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a method for simultaneously generating high order quadrature weights for integrals over Lipschitz domains and their boundaries that requires neither meshing nor moment computation. The weights are determined on pre-defined scattered nodes as a minimum norm solution of a sparse underdetermined linear system arising from a discretization of a suitable boundary value problem by either collocation or meshless finite differences. The method is easy to implement independently of the domain's representation, since it only requires as inputs the position of all quadrature nodes and the direction of outward-pointing normals at each node belonging to the boundary. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and high accuracy of the method on a number of smooth and piecewise smooth domains in 2D and 3D, including some with reentrant corners and edges.</description>

      <title>Numerical spectral analysis of Cauchy-type inverse problems: A probabilistic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to inverse problems for elliptic partial differential equations in an Euclidean domain, in which the boundary and/or interior conditions are given merely on some accessible portion of the boundary and/or inside the domain, the goal being the efficient construction of an approximation for the unknown solution in the remaining part of the domain; such inverse problems are usually called data-completion problems or inverse Cauchy problems. They have been intensively studied in the past decades, but due to their severe instability it has remained an up-to-date challenge to derive both theoretical and numerical methods that can efficiently treat such inverse problems in general settings, especially in high dimensions or in which the solution or the domain exhibit singularities or complex geometries. In this paper we establish a fundamental probabilistic framework in which such inverse problems can be analyzed both theoretically and numerically in terms of the geometry of the domain and the structure of the coefficients. The methods we develop are different from what has been previously proposed in the literature, and are designed to accurately quantify the instability of the inverse problem, as well as to construct a natural subspace of approximate solutions given the available measurements, by simulating the spectrum of the direct problem and performing a singular value decomposition.The approach is based on elliptic measures in conjunction with probabilistic representations and parallel Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed methods are accompanied by a full probabilistic error analysis, showing the convergence of the approximations and providing explicit error bounds. The complexity of the methods is also taken into discussion.We provide thorough numerical simulations performed on graphical processing units, in dimensions two and three, and for various types of domains.</description>

      <title>Consistent multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for solving the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations (VANSE). Different from the approach given in [1], this method is rooted in the widely-adopted density equilibrium distribution, which provides possibility for simulating scenarios where fluid compressibility cannot be ignored, e.g., thermal and multiphase flows. The Chapman-Enskog analysis is presented to confirm the consistency of this scheme at macroscopic level. Some numerical experiments further demonstrate that it achieves second-order convergence and exhibits better numerical performance over previous schemes as reported [2-4].</description>

Our approach involves creating an approximate solution for the turbulence models by employing an interpolant operator based on the observational data of the systems. The estimation depends on the parameter alpha in the models. Additionally, numerical simulations are presented to validate our theoretical results</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a posteriori error estimates for a control-constrained optimal control problem with bang-bang solutions. We consider a solution strategy based on the variational approach, where the control variable is not discretized; no Tikhonov regularization is made. We design, for the proposed scheme, a residual-type a posteriori error estimator that can be decomposed as the sum of two individual contributions related to the discretization of the state and adjoint equations. We explore reliability and efficiency properties of the aforementioned error estimator. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>State-space models are accurate and efficient neural operators for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical methods for predicting dynamical systems, offering faster and more generalizable solutions. However, existing models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and neural operators, face challenges such as long-time integration, long-range dependencies, chaotic dynamics, and extrapolation, to name a few. To this end, this paper introduces state-space models implemented in Mamba for accurate and efficient dynamical system operator learning. Mamba addresses the limitations of existing architectures by dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and enhancing computational efficiency through reparameterization techniques. To extensively test Mamba and compare against another 11 baselines, we introduce several strict extrapolation testbeds that go beyond the standard interpolation benchmarks. We demonstrate Mamba's superior performance in both interpolation and challenging extrapolation tasks. Mamba consistently ranks among the top models while maintaining the lowest computational cost and exceptional extrapolation capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate the good performance of Mamba for a real-world application in quantitative systems pharmacology for assessing the efficacy of drugs in tumor growth under limited data scenarios. Taken together, our findings highlight Mamba's potential as a powerful tool for advancing scientific machine learning in dynamical systems modeling.

      <title>Strong Converse Inequalities for Bernstein Polynomials with Explicit Asymptotic Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain strong converse inequalities for the Bernstein polynomials with explicit asymptotic constants. We give different estimation procedures in the central and non-central regions of [0,1]. The main ingredients in our approach are the following: representation of the derivatives of the Bernstein polynomials in terms of the Krawtchouk polynomials, estimates of different inverse moments of various random variables, sharp estimates of both absolute central moments of Bernstein polynomials and the total variation distance between binomial and Poisson distributions, and iterates of the Bernstein polynomials, together with their probabilistic representations.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach for Solving Distributed Order Fractional Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for solving distributed-order fractional differential equations using a physics-informed machine learning framework. The core of this approach involves extending the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to approximate the unknown solutions of the governing equations during the training phase. By embedding the distributed-order functional equation into the SVR framework, we incorporate physical laws directly into the learning process. To further enhance computational efficiency, Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials are employed as the kernel function, capitalizing on their fractional differentiation properties to streamline the problem formulation. Finally, the resulting optimization problem of SVR is addressed either as a quadratic programming problem or as a positive definite system in its dual form. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a series of numerical experiments on Caputo-based distributed-order fractional differential equations, encompassing both ordinary and partial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Derivation of normal forms for dispersive PDEs via arborification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of normal forms for dispersive equations using decorated trees introduced in arXiv:2005.01649. The key tool is the arborification map which is a morphism from the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra to the Shuffle Hopf algebra. It originates from Ecalle's approach to dynamical systems with singularities. This natural map has been used in many applications ranging from algebra, numerical analysis and rough paths. This connection shows that Hopf algebras also appear naturally in the context of dispersive equations and provide insights into some crucial decomposition.</description>

      <title>Discrete stochastic maximal $ L^p $-regularity and convergence of a spatial semidiscretization for a stochastic parabolic equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the boundedness of the \( H^\infty \)-calculus for the negative discrete Laplace operator subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The discrete Laplace operator is realized via the finite element method, and we demonstrate that its \( H^\infty \)-calculus is uniformly bounded with respect to the spatial mesh size. Using this result, we deduce the discrete stochastic maximal \( L^p \)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Additionally, we provide (almost) optimal error estimates for the semidiscretization under a broad class of spatial \( L^q \)-norms.</description>

      <title>An optimization based limiter for enforcing positivity in a semi-implicit discontinuous Galerkin scheme for compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an optimization based limiter for enforcing positivity of internal energy in a semi-implicit scheme for solving gas dynamics equations. With Strang splitting, the compressible Navier-Stokes system is splitted into the compressible Euler equations, solved by the positivity-preserving Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, and the parabolic subproblem, solved by Crank-Nicolson method with interior penalty DG method. Such a scheme is at most second order accurate in time, high order accurate in space, conservative, and preserves positivity of density. To further enforce the positivity of internal energy, we impose an optimization based limiter for the total energy variable to post process DG polynomial cell averages. The optimization based limiter can be efficiently implemented by the popular first order convex optimization algorithms such as the Douglas-Rachford splitting method if using the optimal algorithm parameters. Numerical tests suggest that the DG method with $\mathbb{Q}^k$ basis and the optimization-based limiter is robust for demanding low pressure problems such as high speed flows.</description>

      <title>A particle-in-Fourier method with energy conservation for non-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel particle-in-Fourier (PIF) scheme that extends its applicability to non-periodic boundary conditions. Our method handles free space boundary conditions by replacing the Fourier Laplacian operator in PIF with a mollified Green's function as first introduced by Vico-Greengard-Ferrando. This modification yields highly accurate free space solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, while still maintaining energy conservation up to an error bounded by the time step size. We also explain how to extend our scheme to arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions via standard potential theory, which we illustrate in detail for Dirichlet boundary conditions on a circular boundary. We support our approach with proof-of-concept numerical results from two-dimensional plasma test cases to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and conservation properties of the scheme. By avoiding grid heating and finite grid instability we are able to show an order of magnitude speedup compared to the standard PIC scheme for a long time integration cyclotron simulation.</description>

      <title>Robust error estimates of PINN in one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate solutions to one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations and establish robust error estimates of PINN regardless of the quantities of the coefficients. In particular, we rigorously demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of solutions using the Sobolev space theory based on a variational approach. Deriving $L^2$-contraction estimates, we show that the error, defined as the mean square of the differences between the true solution and our trial function at the sample points, is dominated by the training loss. Furthermore, we show that as the quantities of the coefficients for the differential equation increase, the error-to-loss ratio rapidly decreases. Our theoretical and experimental results confirm the robustness of the error regardless of the quantities of the coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an optimisation approach motivated by the Blind Source Separation, or also known as Independent Component Analysis, for cointegration between financial time series. Two methods for cointegration tests are introduced, namely decorrelation for the bivariate case and maximisation of nongaussianity for higher-dimensions. The advantages of our methods, especially the better performances in limited sample size, enable a wider range of application and accessibility for researchers and practitioners to identify cointegrating relationships.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Covariance Estimation via Regression on the Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multifidelity estimator of covariance matrices formulated as the solution to a regression problem on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. The estimator is positive definite by construction, and the Mahalanobis distance minimized to obtain it possesses properties enabling practical computation. We show that our manifold regression multifidelity (MRMF) covariance estimator is a maximum likelihood estimator under a certain error model on manifold tangent space. More broadly, we show that our Riemannian regression framework encompasses existing multifidelity covariance estimators constructed from control variates. We demonstrate via numerical examples that the MRMF estimator can provide significant decreases, up to one order of magnitude, in squared estimation error relative to both single-fidelity and other multifidelity covariance estimators. Furthermore, preservation of positive definiteness ensures that our estimator is compatible with downstream tasks, such as data assimilation and metric learning, in which this property is essential.</description>

      <title>A Parallel in Time Algorithm Based on ParaExp for Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new parallel-in-time algorithm for solving optimal control problems constrained by discretized partial differential equations. Our approach, which is based on a deeper understanding of ParaExp, considers an overlapping time-domain decomposition in which we combine the solution of homogeneous problems using exponential propagation with the local solutions of inhomogeneous problems. The algorithm yields a linear system whose matrix-vector product can be fully performed in parallel. We then propose a preconditioner to speed up the convergence of GMRES in the special cases of the heat and wave equations. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our preconditioners.</description>
