      <title>Design, Fabrication, and Measurement of a Hemispherical Multi-Layer Band-Pass Frequency Selective Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hemispherical multilayer wide-band (7-13 GHz) band-pass frequency selective surface (FSS) is reported. A new design technique based on a Goldberg discretization and unit cell scaling technique is introduced to accommodate the curved profile of the FSS. The FSS is additively manufactured by sequentially printing dielectric layers and metallic patterns until 3 patterned silver-ink surfaces are integrated within a 4.5 mm (${\lambda_0}/6$ at 10 GHz) thick ABS hemispherical radome. The diameter and the height of the realized hemispherical FSS are around $5{\lambda_0}$ and $3{\lambda_0}$ respectively. Measurements demonstrate a roughly 1.7 dB insertion loss in the passband and 15-20 dB rejection in the stop-band. Additionally, a new postprocessing technique is used to suppress the effects of edge diffraction in the measured transmission spectrum. The design process, manufacturing technique, and measurement postprocessing represent novel advancements enabling future conformal frequency selective surfaces.</description>

      <title>Experimental Multi-site Testbed for Advanced Control and Optimization of Hybrid Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid energy system (HES) experimental testbed developed at the University of Vermont to support prototyping and validation of advanced control and optimization strategies for grid services. The platform integrates hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation with a reconfigurable set of kilowatt-scale assets, including solar photovoltaic (PV), battery storage, an electrolyzer as a controllable load, and grid-tied inverters. A unified monitoring and communication architecture supports real-time data acquisition, model validation, and control implementation. The testbed's capabilities are demonstrated through a controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) experiment in which a battery system participates in PV power smoothing.</description>

      <title>The PV performance ratio paradox: annual data from large-scale, real-world PV systems show negligible meteorological and technical impact and points to dominant human factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance ratio (PR) is a established measure of efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems. While previous research demonstrated the effects of meteorological and technical variables on PR, a gap persists in the literature on which variables strongly influence PR in large-scale, real-world, heterogeneous PV systems. This paper aims to fill this gap, applying data-driven models to PV systems located in Rond\^onia State, Brazil, to identify which variables strongly influence annual PR, and, hence, should be the target for optimization. Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%). A map of annual final yield was developed for Rond\^onia State and can be used by entrepreneurs to quickly and cheaply estimate energy production.</description>

      <title>When Motion Learns to Listen: Diffusion-Prior Lyapunov Actor-Critic Framework with LLM Guidance for Stable and Robust AUV Control in Underwater Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are indispensable for marine exploration; yet, their control is hindered by nonlinear hydrodynamics, time-varying disturbances, and localization uncertainty. Traditional controllers provide only limited adaptability, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, suffers from sample inefficiency, weak long-term planning, and lacks stability guarantees, leading to unreliable behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-prior Lyapunov actor-critic framework that unifies exploration, stability, and semantic adaptability. Specifically, a diffusion model generates smooth, multimodal, and disturbance-resilient candidate actions; a Lyapunov critic further imposes dual constraints that ensure stability; and a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven outer loop adaptively selects and refines Lyapunov functions based on task semantics and training feedback. This "generation-filtering-optimization" mechanism not only enhances sample efficiency and planning capability but also aligns stability guarantees with diverse mission requirements in the multi-objective optimization task. Extensive simulations under complex ocean dynamics demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves more accurate trajectory tracking, higher task completion rates, improved energy efficiency, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional RL and diffusion-augmented baselines.</description>

      <title>State-Derivative Feedback Control for Damping Low-Frequency Oscillations in Bulk Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency oscillations remain a major challenge in bulk power systems with high renewable penetration, long lines, and large loads. Existing damping strategies based on power modulation of high voltage DC (HVDC) or energy storage, are often limited by fixed control architectures, leaving some modes poorly damped. This paper introduces a state-derivative feedback (SDF) damping controller that uses both frequency and its rate of change as feedback signals. Incorporating state derivatives enhances modal damping and accelerates frequency recovery, enabling HVDC and energy storage to effectively stabilize the grid. We evaluate the SDF controller on two- and three-area systems and compare performance with a frequency difference-based damping scheme. Results show that the SDF control reproduces state-feedback performance while providing good damping of both inter- and intra-area oscillations compared to the frequency-difference method, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for stabilizing power-electronics-rich grids.</description>

      <title>Feature Partitioning and Semantic Equalization for Intrinsic Robustness in Semantic Communication under Packet Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication can improve transmission efficiency by focusing on task-relevant information. However, under packet-based communication protocols, any error typically results in the loss of an entire packet, making semantic communication particularly vulnerable to packet loss. Since high-dimensional semantic features must be partitioned into one-dimensional transmission units during packetization. A critical open question is how to partition semantic features to maximize robustness. To address this, we systematically investigate the performance of two mainstream architectures, Transformer and Convolutional neural networks (CNN), under various feature partitioning schemes. The results show that the Transformer architecture exhibits inherent robustness to packet loss when partitioned along the channel dimension. In contrast, the CNN-based baseline exhibits imbalanced channel utilization, causing severe degradation once dominant channels are lost. To enhance the CNN resilience, we propose a lightweight Semantic Equalization Mechanism (SEM) that balances channel contributions and prevents a few channels from dominating. SEM consists of two parallel approaches: a Dynamic Scale module that adaptively adjusts channel importance, and a Broadcast module that facilitates information interaction among channels. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN equipped with SEM achieve graceful degradation under packet loss (retaining about 85% of lossless PSNR at 40% packet loss), comparable to that of Transformer models. Our findings indicate that, under an appropriate partitioning strategy, maintaining a balanced semantic representation is a fundamental condition for achieving intrinsic robustness against packet loss. These insights may also extend to other modalities such as video and support practical semantic communication design.</description>

      <title>Continuous Resilience in Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Extending Architectural Models through Adaptive Coordination and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems of systems (CPSoS) are highly complex, dynamic environments in which technical, cybernetic and organisational subsystems interact closely with one another. Dynamic, continuously adaptable resilience is required to ensure their functionality under variable conditions. However, existing resilience architectures usually only deal with adaptation implicitly and thus remain predominantly static. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new Adaptive Coordination Layer (ACL) and conceptually redefining the Adaptation &amp; Learning Layer (AL). The ACL acts as an operational control layer that detects risks in real time, prioritises countermeasures and coordinates them dynamically. The AL is reinterpreted as a strategic-cooperative layer that evaluates the operational decisions of the ACL, learns from them, and derives long-term adjustments at the policy, governance, and architecture levels. Together, both layers operationalise the resilience principle of adaptation and combine short-term responsiveness with long-term learning and development capabilities. The paper describes various implementation variants of both levels - from rule-based and KPI-driven approaches to AI-supported and meta-learning mechanisms - and shows how these can be combined depending on system complexity, data availability and degree of regulation. The proposed architecture model no longer understands resilience as a static system property, but as a continuous, data-driven process of mutual coordination and systemic learning. This creates a methodological basis for the next generation of adaptive and resilient CPSoS.</description>

      <title>Comparison of linear observation techniques for robust load torque estimation in actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of estimating robustly the external load torque in rotary actuator systems, when only the generated motor drive torque and angular displacement are the available input and output. We compare, theoretically and experimentally, two sufficiently established linear observation techniques (i) reduced-order Luenberger observer and (ii) disturbance observer, both using the same identified model of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)-based actuator. Our goal is to highlight several aspects related to the implementation, relative degree of the input-torque to estimated-load-torque transfer characteristics, observer open-loop transfer function, and the associated sensitivity (respectively stability margins) with respect to inherently uncertain system plants. Apart from the developed analysis, a detailed experimental case study is demonstrated where the load torque sensor provides reference measurements and allows for evaluation of both observers.</description>

      <title>KNN and Time Series Based Prediction of Power Generation from Renewable Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the world shifts towards utilizing natural resources for electricity generation, there is need to enhance forecasting systems to guarantee a stable electricity provision and to incorporate the generated power into the network systems. This work provides a machine learning environment for renewable energy forecasting that prevents the flaws which are usually experienced in the actual process; intermittency, nonlinearity and intricacy in nature which is difficult to grasp by ordinary existing forecasting procedures. Leveraging a comprehensive approximately 30-year dataset encompassing multiple renewable energy sources, our research evaluates two distinct approaches: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and Non-Linear Autoregressive distributed called with Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast total power generation using the solar, wind, and hydroelectric resources. The framework uses high temporal resolution and multiple parameters of the environment to improve the predictions. The fact that both the models in terms of error metrics were equally significant and had some unique tendencies at certain circumstances. The long history allows for better model calibration of temporal fluctuations and seasonal and climatic effects on power generation. The reliability enhancement in the prediction function, which benefits from 30 years of data, has value to grid operators, energy traders, and those establishing renewable energy policies and standards concerning reliability</description>

      <title>Power Flow Solution in Unbalanced 3-Wire MV and 4-Wire LV Networks Using Symmetrical and Eigen-basis Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large penetration of distributed generations impacts both the secondary low-voltage (LV) and the primary medium-voltage (MV) segments of the distribution network. Optimizing power flow calculations for the integrated MV/LV networks is crucial for the real-time management of modern distribution networks. Traditional methods in symmetrical coordinates are primarily limited to the three-wire model of three-phase networks, often leading to inaccuracies in power flow calculations when applied to three-phase four-wire LV segments. This paper introduces a novel power flow method for integrated three-wire MV and four-wire LV networks. Using eigenvector decomposition to diagonalize the admittance matrix of four-wire LV lines, the proposed method improves the computational efficiency of power flow calculations and accurately calculates the neutral-to-ground voltage. The results of the case studies show over 50\% reduction in the number of non-zero elements in the LU factors of the bus admittance matrix, and speed-up factors of 2.78 on the IEEE 123-node test system and 3.63 on the IEEE 8500-node test system in execution times for Volt/Var control (VVC), compared to the phase coordinates model.</description>

      <title>Distributed Switching Model Predictive Control Meets Koopman Operator for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Koopman-enhanced distributed switched model predictive control (SMPC) framework for safe and scalable navigation of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The proposed method integrates switched motion modes and data-driven prediction to enable real-time, collision-free coordination. A localized Koopman operator approximates nonlinear obstacle dynamics as linear models based on online measurements, enabling accurate trajectory forecasting. These predictions are embedded into a distributed SMPC structure, where each UAV makes autonomous decisions using local and cluster-based information. This computationally efficient architecture is particularly promising for applications in surface transportation, including coordinated vehicle flows, shared infrastructure with pedestrians or cyclists, and urban UAV traffic. Simulation results demonstrate reliable formation control and real-time obstacle avoidance, highlighting the frameworks broad relevance for intelligent and cooperative mobility systems.</description>

      <title>Influence of Transmission Rank on EMF Exposure Measured With Provoked Data Traffic Around 5G Massive MIMO Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of 5G New Radio networks with massive MIMO technology has complicated electromagnetic field exposure assessments for radiation protection. Massive MIMO transmission enables beamforming, beam steering, and spatial multiplexing across multiple transmission layers, with the number of simultaneous transmission paths depending on the rank of the radio channel, further named 'transmission rank'. Since the total transmission power of a base station is shared among these layers, rank variations affect the measured exposure levels, e.g., when assessments use provoked traffic via user equipment. This study investigates the impact of the transmission rank on the measured maximum exposure in the 3.6 GHz (n78) band of a German 5G network employing massive MIMO technology. Field measurements were performed using a spectrum analyzer with isotropic probe, to capture maximum field strengths under full-load traffic conditions. The transmission rank was manipulated by artificially degrading the reception quality of the user equipment with a shielding bag, forcing a single transmission layer (rank-1). The results were compared with unshielded operation allowing up to the maximum number of four independent transmission layers (rank-4). The data reveal exposure differences ranging from 1.7 dB to 5.4 dB, with a median of 4.3 dB at the measurement points studied. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the transmission rank in exposure assessments to electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic design and implementation considerations of deep MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Model Predictive Control (Deep MPC) is an evolving field that integrates model predictive control and deep learning. This manuscript is focused on a particular approach, which employs deep neural network in the loop with MPC. This class of approaches distributes control authority between a neural network and an MPC controller, in such a way that the neural network learns the model uncertainties while the MPC handles constraints. The approach is appealing because training data collected while the system is in operation can be used to fine-tune the neural network, and MPC prevents unsafe behavior during those learning transients. This manuscript explains implementation challenges of Deep MPC, algorithmic way to distribute control authority and argues that a poor choice in distributing control authority may lead to poor performance. A reason of poor performance is explained through a numerical experiment on a four-wheeled skid-steer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Computing the Hard Scaled Relative Graph of LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems, where Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems are the fundamental building block. To analyze feedback loops with unstable LTI components, the hard SRG is required, since it aptly captures the input/output behavior on the extended $L_2$ space. In this paper, we develop a systematic computational method to exactly compute the hard SRG of LTI systems, which may be unstable and contain integrators. We also study its connection to the Nyquist criterion, including the multivariable case, and demonstrate our method on several examples.</description>

Abstract: On April 28, 2025, the Iberian power system suffered a full blackout. It was the first documented overvoltage-driven cascade in Europe. The event sparked debate about root causes, including high renewables output, low inertia, and operator actions. This paper presents a thorough power system analysis of the incident to sort signal from noise and explain, step by step, how the blackout unfolded. Specifically, we (i) reconstruct the timeline and causal chain of the incident, (ii) present and summarize contributing factors using factual findings from incident reports, (iii) reproduce the blackout on an IEEE test system, (iv) analyze the incident from a system-theoretic, voltage-control perspective, and (v) translate our analysis into practical, technical measures that aim to mitigate and prevent similar incidents.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Adaptive Stabilisation of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the adaptive control problem for discrete-time, nonlinear stochastic systems with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming access to a parameterised family of controllers that can stabilise the system in a bounded set within an informative region of the state space when the parameter is well-chosen, we propose a certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy, and subsequently derive stability bounds on the closed-loop system that hold for some probabilities. We then show that if the entire state space is informative, and the family of controllers is globally stabilising with appropriately chosen parameters, high probability stability guarantees can be derived.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic transients and failed upward leaders observed during lightning activity in an onshore wind farm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a wind farm in Croatia, lightning activity is monitored across the entire site using a lightning location system, and on a single wind turbine equipped with a Rogowski-coil-based current measurement system and a high-speed camera, all independently GPS-synchronized. In addition to recording lightning flash currents on the monitored turbine, the system is frequently triggered by electromagnetic disturbances caused by nearby lightning flashes. These include direct flashes to two neighboring turbines that share the same cable connection to the substation and have interconnected grounding systems with buried bare conductor, as well as cloud-to-ground flashes to soil near cable routes, where the resulting electromagnetic fields couple onto the cables, causing surges to propagate to the monitored turbine. The camera occasionally captures failed upward connecting leaders from the monitored turbine during these lightning events. This paper presents three cases of flashes to two neighboring wind turbines and two cases of cloud-to-ground flashes to nearby soil, all of which induced electromagnetic transients that propagated to the monitored turbine. Failed upward connecting leaders were observed in some of these cases. This paper provides observational analysis, providing Rogowski measurements of electromagnetic disturbances and failed leader currents, complemented by high-speed camera and lightning location system data.</description>

      <title>RampoNN: A Reachability-Guided System Falsification for Efficient Cyber-Kinetic Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting kinetic vulnerabilities in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), vulnerabilities in control code that can precipitate hazardous physical consequences, is a critical challenge. This task is complicated by the need to analyze the intricate coupling between complex software behavior and the system's physical dynamics. Furthermore, the periodic execution of control code in CPS applications creates a combinatorial explosion of execution paths that must be analyzed over time, far exceeding the scope of traditional single-run code analysis.
  This paper introduces RampoNN, a novel framework that systematically identifies kinetic vulnerabilities given the control code, a physical system model, and a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification of safe behavior. RampoNN first analyzes the control code to map the control signals that can be generated under various execution branches. It then employs a neural network to abstract the physical system's behavior. To overcome the poor scaling and loose over-approximations of standard neural network reachability, RampoNN uniquely utilizes Deep Bernstein neural networks, which are equipped with customized reachability algorithms that yield orders of magnitude tighter bounds. This high-precision reachability analysis allows RampoNN to rapidly prune large sets of guaranteed-safe behaviors and rank the remaining traces by their potential to violate the specification. The results of this analysis are then used to effectively guide a falsification engine, focusing its search on the most promising system behaviors to find actual vulnerabilities.
  We evaluated our approach on a PLC-controlled water tank system and a switched PID controller for an automotive engine. The results demonstrate that RampoNN leads to acceleration of the process of finding kinetic vulnerabilities by up to 98.27% and superior scalability compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Single-Pixel Tactile Skin via Compressive Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of large-area, high-speed electronic skins is a grand challenge for robotics, prosthetics, and human-machine interfaces, but is fundamentally limited by wiring complexity and data bottlenecks. Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>Generative MIMO Beam Map Construction for Location Recovery and Beam Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has greatly advanced data-driven channel modeling and resource optimization in wireless communication systems. However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study linear policy approximations for the risk-conscious operation of an industrial energy system with uncertain wind power, significant and variable electricity demand, and high thermal output, as found in a modern foundry. The system incorporates thermal storage and operates under rolling forecasts, leading to a sequential decision-making framework. To address uncertainty in key parameters, we formulate chance-constrained optimization problems that limit the probability of critical constraint violations, such as unmet demand requirements or the exceedance of system boundaries. To reduce computational effort, we replace direct uncertainty handling with a parameter-modified cost function that approximates the underlying risk structure. We validate our method through a numerical case study, demonstrating the trade-offs between operational efficiency and reliability in a stochastic environment.</description>

      <title>Convergence and stability of Q-learning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning promises, among other benefits, to efficiently capture and utilize the temporal structure of a decision-making problem and to enhance continual learning capabilities, but theoretical guarantees lag behind practice. In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Bayesian Transfer Learning into Particle Filter for Dual-Tracking System with Asymmetric Noise Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Bayesian transfer learning, we develop a particle filter approach for tracking a nonlinear dynamical model in a dual-tracking system where intensities of measurement noise for both sensors are asymmetric. The densities for Bayesian transfer learning are approximated with the sum of weighted particles to improve the tracking performance of the primary sensor, which experiences a higher noise intensity compared to the source sensor. We present simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to an isolated particle filter and transfer learning applied to the unscented Kalman filter and the cubature Kalman filter. Furthermore, increasing the number of particles shows an improvement in the performance of transfer learning applied to the particle filter with a higher rate compared to the isolated particle filter. However, increasing the number of particles raises computational time per step. Moreover, the performance gain from incorporating Bayesian transfer learning is approximately linearly proportional to the absolute difference value between the noise intensities of the sensors in the dual-tracking system.</description>

      <title>A Patient-Centric Blockchain Framework for Secure Electronic Health Record Management: Decoupling Data Storage from Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a patient-centric architecture for electronic health record (EHR) sharing that separates content storage from authorization and audit. Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Data from Clustered LQR Systems: Personalized and Collaborative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Beyond yield: integrating energy, water, cost, and carbon to benchmark indoor vertical farming viability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interest in vertical farming arises from its ability to ensure consistent, high-quality, and pest-free vegetable production while supporting synergies with energy systems and urban development. While previous studies have assessed energy use and cost-effectiveness in vertical farming using simplified models, this study fills a gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of how individual input parameters affect efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability through a detailed modeling framework with sensitivity and correlation analyses. 162 scenarios were evaluated by combining three levels of temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density, and CO2 concentration across three distinct localities, namely Trondheim, Shanghai, and Dubai regions, which differ from a socio-environmental viewpoint. Two insulation thicknesses were also tested in each scenario. Results indicate that, due to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and dehumidification system, crop productivity could be kept optimal regardless of insulation or the external climate. Photosynthetic photon flux density was the dominant growth factor (correlation: 0.85), followed by CO2 (0.36) and temperature (0.22), and also the driver of energy consumption (0.73). The lowest specific energy consumption coincided with the lowest productivity (55 kg/m2). Levelized cost of lettuce identified the most cost-effective setup as 24{\deg}C, 250 umol/m2s photosynthetic photon flux density, 1400ppm CO2, with insulation (102kg/m2). Only decarbonized energy systems can support vertical farming without increasing CO2 emissions compared to imported lettuce. These findings guide practitioners and policymakers in selecting cost-effective, sustainable vertical farming strategies and provide validated data for research and implementation across diverse climatic and energy contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy leads to a continuous reduction in system inertia, for which conventional synchronization criteria based solely on frequency consistency can no longer accurately capture the coupled dynamics of frequency and voltage during transients. To address this issue, this paper employs the concept of complex frequency and develops an analysis framework that integrates theory, indices, and simulation for assessing synchronization stability in low-inertia power systems. First, the basic concepts and mathematical formulation of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization are introduced. Then, dynamic criteria for local and global complex synchronization are established, upon which a complex inertia index is proposed. This index unifies the supporting role of traditional frequency inertia and the voltage support capability associated with voltage inertia, enabling quantitative evaluation of the strength of coordinated frequency-voltage support and disturbance rejection within a region. Finally, transient simulations on a modified IEEE 9-bus system are carried out to validate the proposed method. The results show that the method can clearly reveal the synchronization relationships between subnetworks and the overall system, providing a useful theoretical reference for stability analysis and control strategy design in low-inertia power systems.</description>

      <title>Solving Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control Problems using the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed machine learning approach for synthesizing optimal feedback control policy for infinite-horizon optimal control problems by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation(PDE). The optimal control policy is derived analytically for affine dynamical systems with separable and strictly convex control costs, expressed as a function of the gradient of the value function. The resulting HJB-PDE is then solved by approximating the value function using the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC) - a hybrid approach that combines the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) with the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. This approach ensures analytical satisfaction of boundary conditions and significantly reduces training cost compared to traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We benchmark the method on linear and non-linear systems with known analytical solutions as well as demonstrate its effectiveness on control tasks such as spacecraft optimal de-tumbling control.</description>

To achieve this, firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the multi-area interconnected system incorporating disturbances from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) generation and load demand, as aggregated uncertainties. Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed GITSMC approach, achieving approximately 94.9% improvement in ITSE and 94.4% improvement in ISE, confirming its superior accuracy and dynamic performance compared to the existing controller.</description>

      <title>On the Contraction of Excitable Systems</title>

Abstract: We analyze contraction in conductance-based excitable systems and link it to reliable spike timing. For a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with synaptic input, we prove the unforced dynamics is incrementally exponentially stable on a compact physiological set. With impulsive inputs, contraction persists under an average dwell-time condition, and for periodic spike trains we derive an explicit lower bound on the inter-impulse period. In the high-rate limit the synapse is effectively held open, the conductance is nearly constant, and self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations can arise, so contraction no longer holds. This continuous-time view explains when spike times extracted by an event detector remain robust across trials, and simulations confirm both regimes.</description>

      <title>Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate -- based on the theory of upper-C1 functions -- the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. Accordingly, we propose to explore the parametric space with either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization, and to subsequently perform local exploitation with Sequential Quadratic Programming to compute Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: as in the state-of-art algorithm for standard robust control, identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. We show that the proposed method largely outperforms Monte-Carlo sampling alone, is able to reliably detect even rare worst-case configurations in minutes on a standard laptop, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations. Even in the unconstrained case, the proposed framework complements traditional methods, as it scales to plants with many parameters and states and explores the entire parametric space, albeit without formal guarantees of global optimality.</description>

      <title>Perception, Control and Hardware for In-Hand Slip-Aware Object Manipulation with Parallel Grippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation offers significant potential to enhance robotic manipulator capabilities. This paper presents a sensori-motor architecture for in-hand slip-aware control, being embodied in a sensorized gripper. The gripper in our architecture features rapid closed-loop, low-level force control, and is equipped with sensors capable of independently measuring contact forces and sliding velocities. Our system can quickly estimate essential object properties during pick-up using only in-hand sensing, without relying on prior object information. We introduce four distinct slippage controllers: gravity-assisted trajectory following for both rotational and linear slippage, a hinge controller that maintains the object's orientation while the gripper rotates, and a slip-avoidance controller. The gripper is mounted on a robot arm and validated through extensive experiments involving a diverse range of objects, demonstrating the architecture's novel capabilities for manipulating objects with flat surfaces.</description>

      <title>AgriChrono: A Multi-modal Dataset Capturing Crop Growth and Lighting Variability with a Field Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in AI and Robotics have accelerated significant initiatives in agriculture, particularly in the areas of robot navigation and 3D digital twin creation. A significant bottleneck impeding this progress is the critical lack of "in-the-wild" datasets that capture the full complexities of real farmland, including non-rigid motion from wind, drastic illumination variance, and morphological changes resulting from growth. This data gap fundamentally limits research on robust AI models for autonomous field navigation and scene-level dynamic 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a modular robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture these dynamic farmland conditions. Our platform integrates multiple sensors, enabling remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, IMU, and Pose data for efficient and repeatable long-term data collection in real-world agricultural environments. We successfully collected 18TB of data over one month, documenting the entire growth cycle of Canola under diverse illumination conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods on AgriChrono, revealing the profound challenge of reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic non-rigid scenes in such farmland settings. This benchmark validates AgriChrono as a critical asset for advancing model generalization, and its public release is expected to significantly accelerate research and development in precision agriculture.
