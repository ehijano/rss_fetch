      <title>Speech-based Clinical Depression Screening: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the utility of speech signals for AI-based depression screening across varied interaction scenarios, including psychiatric interviews, chatbot conversations, and text readings. Participants includes depressed patients recruited from the outpatient clinics of Peking University Sixth Hospital and control group members from the community, all diagnosed by psychiatrists following standardized diagnostic protocols. We extracted acoustic and deep speech features from each participant's segmented recordings. Classifications were made using neural networks or SVMs, with aggregated clip outcomes determining final assessments. Our analysis across interaction scenarios, speech processing techniques, and feature types confirms speech as a crucial marker for depression screening. Specifically, human-computer interaction matches clinical interview efficacy, surpassing reading tasks. Segment duration and quantity significantly affect model performance, with deep speech features substantially outperforming traditional acoustic features.</description>

      <title>Harder or Different? Understanding Generalization of Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has highlighted a key issue in speech deepfake detection: models trained on one set of deepfakes perform poorly on others. The question arises: is this due to the continuously improving quality of Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, i.e., are newer DeepFakes just 'harder' to detect? Or, is it because deepfakes generated with one model are fundamentally different to those generated using another model? We answer this question by decomposing the performance gap between in-domain and out-of-domain test data into 'hardness' and 'difference' components. Experiments performed using ASVspoof databases indicate that the hardness component is practically negligible, with the performance gap being attributed primarily to the difference component. This has direct implications for real-world deepfake detection, highlighting that merely increasing model capacity, the currently-dominant research trend, may not effectively address the generalization challenge.</description>

      <title>Improving Audio Codec-based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Multi-Modal Context and Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and development of audio codecs greatly propel the zero-shot TTS. They can synthesize personalized speech with only a 3-second speech of an unseen speaker as acoustic prompt. However, they only support short speech prompts and cannot leverage longer context information, as required in audiobook and conversational TTS scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel audio codec-based TTS model to adapt context features with multiple enhancements. Inspired by the success of Qformer, we propose a multi-modal context-enhanced Qformer (MMCE-Qformer) to utilize additional multi-modal context information. Besides, we adapt a pretrained LLM to leverage its understanding ability to predict semantic tokens, and use a SoundStorm to generate acoustic tokens thereby enhancing audio quality and speaker similarity. The extensive objective and subjective evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across various context TTS scenarios.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation in Prompt-based Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Context-Aware Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent prompt-based text-to-speech (TTS) models can clone an unseen speaker using only a short speech prompt. They leverage a strong in-context ability to mimic the speech prompts, including speaker style, prosody, and emotion. Therefore, the selection of a speech prompt greatly influences the generated speech, akin to the importance of a prompt in large language models (LLMs). However, current prompt-based TTS models choose the speech prompt manually or simply at random. Hence, in this paper, we adapt retrieval augmented generation (RAG) from LLMs to prompt-based TTS. Unlike traditional RAG methods, we additionally consider contextual information during the retrieval process and present a Context-Aware Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training (CA-CLAP) model to extract context-aware, style-related features. The objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed RAG method outperforms baselines, and our CA-CLAP achieves better results than text-only retrieval methods.</description>

      <title>SilentCipher: Deep Audio Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of audio watermarking, it is challenging to simultaneously encode imperceptible messages while enhancing the message capacity and robustness. Although recent advancements in deep learning-based methods bolster the message capacity and robustness over traditional methods, the encoded messages introduce audible artefacts that restricts their usage in professional settings. In this study, we introduce three key innovations. Firstly, our work is the first deep learning-based model to integrate psychoacoustic model based thresholding to achieve imperceptible watermarks. Secondly, we introduce psuedo-differentiable compression layers, enhancing the robustness of our watermarking algorithm. Lastly, we introduce a method to eliminate the need for perceptual losses, enabling us to achieve SOTA in both robustness as well as imperceptible watermarking. Our contributions lead us to SilentCipher, a model enabling users to encode messages within audio signals sampled at 44.1kHz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a limited amount of large-scale public datasets that contain downloadable music audio files and rich lead singer metadata. To provide such a dataset to benefit research in singing voices, we created Singer Traits Dataset (STraDa) with two subsets: automatic-strada and annotated-strada. The automatic-strada contains twenty-five thousand tracks across numerous genres and languages of more than five thousand unique lead singers, which includes cross-validated lead singer metadata as well as other track metadata. The annotated-strada consists of two hundred tracks that are balanced in terms of 2 genders, 5 languages, and 4 age groups. To show its use for model training and bias analysis thanks to its metadata's richness and downloadable audio files, we benchmarked singer sex classification (SSC) and conducted bias analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancement in large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in combining LLMs with multimodal learning. Previous surveys of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mainly focus on understanding. This survey elaborates on multimodal generation across different domains, including image, video, 3D, and audio, where we highlight the notable advancements with milestone works in these fields. Specifically, we exhaustively investigate the key technical components behind methods and multimodal datasets utilized in these studies. Moreover, we dig into tool-augmented multimodal agents that can use existing generative models for human-computer interaction. Lastly, we also comprehensively discuss the advancement in AI safety and investigate emerging applications as well as future prospects. Our work provides a systematic and insightful overview of multimodal generation, which is expected to advance the development of Artificial Intelligence for Generative Content (AIGC) and world models.

      <title>Style Mixture of Experts for Expressive Text-To-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in style transfer text-to-speech (TTS) have improved the expressiveness of synthesized speech. Despite these advancements, encoding stylistic information from diverse and unseen reference speech remains challenging. This paper introduces StyleMoE, an approach that divides the embedding space, modeled by the style encoder, into tractable subsets handled by style experts. The proposed method replaces the style encoder in a TTS system with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer. By utilizing a gating network to route reference speeches to different style experts, each expert specializes in aspects of the style space during optimization. Our experiments objectively and subjectively demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in increasing the coverage of the style space for diverse and unseen styles. This approach can enhance the performance of existing state-of-the-art style transfer TTS models, marking the first study of MoE in style transfer TTS to our knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a multimodal dataset obtained from a honey bee colony in Montr\'eal, Quebec, Canada, spanning the years of 2021 to 2022. This apiary comprised 10 beehives, with microphones recording more than 2000 hours of high quality raw audio, and also sensors capturing temperature, and humidity. Periodic hive inspections involved monitoring colony honey bee population changes, assessing queen-related conditions, and documenting overall hive health. Additionally, health metrics, such as Varroa mite infestation rates and winter mortality assessments were recorded, offering valuable insights into factors affecting hive health status and resilience. In this study, we first outline the data collection process, sensor data description, and dataset structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate a practical application of this dataset by extracting various features from the raw audio to predict colony population using the number of frames of bees as a proxy.</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-Shot Chinese-English Code-Switching ASR with kNN-CTC and Gated Monolingual Datastores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kNN-CTC model has proven to be effective for monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, its direct application to multilingual scenarios like code-switching, presents challenges. Although there is potential for performance improvement, a kNN-CTC model utilizing a single bilingual datastore can inadvertently introduce undesirable noise from the alternative language. To address this, we propose a novel kNN-CTC-based code-switching ASR (CS-ASR) framework that employs dual monolingual datastores and a gated datastore selection mechanism to reduce noise interference. Our method selects the appropriate datastore for decoding each frame, ensuring the injection of language-specific information into the ASR process. We apply this framework to cutting-edge CTC-based models, developing an advanced CS-ASR system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our gated datastore mechanism in enhancing the performance of zero-shot Chinese-English CS-ASR.</description>

      <title>BLSP-Emo: Towards Empathetic Large Speech-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent release of GPT-4o showcased the potential of end-to-end multimodal models, not just in terms of low latency but also in their ability to understand and generate expressive speech with rich emotions. While the details are unknown to the open research community, it likely involves significant amounts of curated data and compute, neither of which is readily accessible. In this paper, we present BLSP-Emo (Bootstrapped Language-Speech Pretraining with Emotion support), a novel approach to developing an end-to-end speech-language model capable of understanding both semantics and emotions in speech and generate empathetic responses. BLSP-Emo utilizes existing speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets through a two-stage process. The first stage focuses on semantic alignment, following recent work on pretraining speech-language models using ASR data. The second stage performs emotion alignment with the pretrained speech-language model on an emotion-aware continuation task constructed from SER data. Our experiments demonstrate that the BLSP-Emo model excels in comprehending speech and delivering empathetic responses, both in instruction-following tasks and conversations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Speech-Based Suicide Risk Detection Using Whisper and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early detection of suicide risk is important since it enables the intervention to prevent potential suicide attempts. This paper studies the automatic detection of suicide risk based on spontaneous speech from adolescents, and collects a Mandarin dataset with 15 hours of suicide speech from more than a thousand adolescents aged from ten to eighteen for our experiments. To leverage the diverse acoustic and linguistic features embedded in spontaneous speech, both the Whisper speech model and textual large language models (LLMs) are used for suicide risk detection. Both all-parameter finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning approaches are used to adapt the pre-trained models for suicide risk detection, and multiple audio-text fusion approaches are evaluated to combine the representations of Whisper and the LLM. The proposed system achieves a detection accuracy of 0.807 and an F1-score of 0.846 on the test set with 119 subjects, indicating promising potential for real suicide risk detection applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound event detection is the task of recognizing sounds and determining their extent (onset/offset times) within an audio clip. Existing systems commonly predict sound presence confidence in short time frames. Then, thresholding produces binary frame-level presence decisions, with the extent of individual events determined by merging consecutive positive frames. In this paper, we show that frame-level thresholding degrades the prediction of the event extent by coupling it with the system's sound presence confidence. We propose to decouple the prediction of event extent and confidence by introducing SEBBs, which format each sound event prediction as a tuple of a class type, extent, and overall confidence. We also propose a change-detection-based algorithm to convert legacy frame-level outputs into SEBBs. We find the algorithm significantly improves the performance of DCASE 2023 Challenge systems, boosting the state of the art from .644 to .686 PSDS1.</description>

      <title>Beyond Performance Plateaus: A Comprehensive Study on Scalability in Speech Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based speech enhancement (SE) models have achieved impressive performance in the past decade. Numerous advanced architectures have been designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance; however, their scalability potential remains unrevealed. Meanwhile, the majority of research focuses on small-sized datasets with restricted diversity, leading to a plateau in performance improvement. In this paper, we aim to provide new insights for addressing the above issues by exploring the scalability of SE models in terms of architectures, model sizes, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our investigation involves several popular SE architectures and speech data from different domains. Experiments reveal both similarities and distinctions between the scaling effects in SE and other tasks such as speech recognition. These findings further provide insights into the under-explored SE directions, e.g., larger-scale multi-domain corpora and efficiently scalable architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study music generation conditioned solely on the video. First, we present a large-scale dataset comprising 190K video-music pairs, including various genres such as movie trailers, advertisements, and documentaries. Furthermore, we propose VidMuse, a simple framework for generating music aligned with video inputs. VidMuse stands out by producing high-fidelity music that is both acoustically and semantically aligned with the video. By incorporating local and global visual cues, VidMuse enables the creation of musically coherent audio tracks that consistently match the video content through Long-Short-Term modeling. Through extensive experiments, VidMuse outperforms existing models in terms of audio quality, diversity, and audio-visual alignment. The code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/ZeyueT/VidMuse/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a prominent model framework for audio tagging (AT), boasting state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the widely-used Audioset dataset. However, their impressive performance often comes at the cost of high memory usage, slow inference speed, and considerable model delay, rendering them impractical for real-world AT applications. In this study, we introduce streaming audio transformers (SAT) that combine the vision transformer (ViT) architecture with Transformer-Xl-like chunk processing, enabling efficient processing of long-range audio signals. Our proposed SAT is benchmarked against other transformer-based SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision (mAP) at a delay of 2s and 1s, while also exhibiting significantly lower memory usage and computational overhead. Checkpoints are publicly available https://github.com/RicherMans/SAT.</description>

      <title>ConsistencyTTA: Accelerating Diffusion-Based Text-to-Audio Generation with Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are instrumental in text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Unfortunately, they suffer from slow inference due to an excessive number of queries to the underlying denoising network per generation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce ConsistencyTTA, a framework requiring only a single non-autoregressive network query, thereby accelerating TTA by hundreds of times. We achieve so by proposing "CFG-aware latent consistency model," which adapts consistency generation into a latent space and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) into model training. Moreover, unlike diffusion models, ConsistencyTTA can be finetuned closed-loop with audio-space text-aware metrics, such as CLAP score, to further enhance the generations. Our objective and subjective evaluation on the AudioCaps dataset shows that compared to diffusion-based counterparts, ConsistencyTTA reduces inference computation by 400x while retaining generation quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>EFFUSE: Efficient Self-Supervised Feature Fusion for E2E ASR in Low Resource and Multilingual Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models have demonstrated exceptional performance in various speech tasks, particularly in low-resource and multilingual domains. Recent works show that fusing diverse SSL models could achieve superior performance compared to using one SSL model. However, fusing models increases the overall parameter size, leading to higher computational costs. We propose EFFUSE, a novel approach that uses a single SSL model to mimic the features of multiple SSL models via prediction, resulting in a lightweight framework with competitive performance. Our experiments show that EFFUSE outperforms individual SSL models in multilingual speech recognition tasks. Our best performing model achieves an average SUPERB score increase of 63.5 (6.3%) from the SSL baselines in Multilingual Speech Universal PERformance Benchmark (ML-SUPERB), while decreasing parameter size on average by 317M parameters (49%) from the fusion models.</description>

      <title>Proactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of speech generative models, there is a pressing need to ensure audio authenticity against the risks of voice cloning. We present AudioSeal, the first audio watermarking technique designed specifically for localized detection of AI-generated speech. AudioSeal employs a generator/detector architecture trained jointly with a localization loss to enable localized watermark detection up to the sample level, and a novel perceptual loss inspired by auditory masking, that enables AudioSeal to achieve better imperceptibility. AudioSeal achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of robustness to real life audio manipulations and imperceptibility based on automatic and human evaluation metrics. Additionally, AudioSeal is designed with a fast, single-pass detector, that significantly surpasses existing models in speed - achieving detection up to two orders of magnitude faster, making it ideal for large-scale and real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Dance Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dance serves as a powerful medium for expressing human emotions, but the lifelike generation of dance is still a considerable challenge. Recently, diffusion models have showcased remarkable generative abilities across various domains. They hold promise for human motion generation due to their adaptable many-to-many nature. Nonetheless, current diffusion-based motion generation models often create entire motion sequences directly and unidirectionally, lacking focus on the motion with local and bidirectional enhancement. When choreographing high-quality dance movements, people need to take into account not only the musical context but also the nearby music-aligned dance motions. To authentically capture human behavior, we propose a Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model (BADM) for music-to-dance generation, where a bidirectional encoder is built to enforce that the generated dance is harmonious in both the forward and backward directions. To make the generated dance motion smoother, a local information decoder is built for local motion enhancement. The proposed framework is able to generate new motions based on the input conditions and nearby motions, which foresees individual motion slices iteratively and consolidates all predictions. To further refine the synchronicity between the generated dance and the beat, the beat information is incorporated as an input to generate better music-aligned dance movements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing unidirectional approaches on the prominent benchmark for music-to-dance generation.</description>

      <title>Iterative Feature Boosting for Explainable Speech Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In speech emotion recognition (SER), using predefined features without considering their practical importance may lead to high dimensional datasets, including redundant and irrelevant information. Consequently, high-dimensional learning often results in decreasing model accuracy while increasing computational complexity. Our work underlines the importance of carefully considering and analyzing features in order to build efficient SER systems. We present a new supervised SER method based on an efficient feature engineering approach. We pay particular attention to the explainability of results to evaluate feature relevance and refine feature sets. This is performed iteratively through feature evaluation loop, using Shapley values to boost feature selection and improve overall framework performance. Our approach allows thus to balance the benefits between model performance and transparency. The proposed method outperforms human-level performance (HLP) and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in emotion recognition on the TESS dataset.

      <title>Enhanced Classification of Heart Sounds Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients: A Comparative Study of Single and Ensemble Classifier Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the efficacy of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in detecting abnormal phonocardiograms using two classification strategies: a single-classifier and an ensemble-classifier approach. Phonocardiograms were segmented into S1, systole, S2, and diastole intervals, with thirteen MFCCs estimated from each segment, yielding 52 MFCCs per beat. In the single-classifier strategy, the MFCCs from nine consecutive beats were averaged to classify phonocardiograms. Conversely, the ensemble-classifier strategy employed nine classifiers to individually assess beats as normal or abnormal, with the overall classification based on the majority vote. Both methods were tested on a publicly available phonocardiogram database. Results demonstrated that the ensemble-classifier strategy achieved higher accuracy compared to the single-classifier approach, establishing MFCCs as more effective than other features, including time, time-frequency, and statistical features, evaluated in similar studies.</description>

      <title>RepCodec: A Speech Representation Codec for Speech Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With recent rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech tokenization has played an important role for injecting speech into LLMs. However, this discretization gives rise to a loss of information, consequently impairing overall performance. To improve the performance of these discrete speech tokens, we present RepCodec, a novel speech representation codec for semantic speech tokenization. In contrast to audio codecs which reconstruct the raw audio, RepCodec learns a vector quantization codebook through reconstructing speech representations from speech encoders like HuBERT or data2vec. Together, the speech encoder, the codec encoder and the vector quantization codebook form a pipeline for converting speech waveforms into semantic tokens. The extensive experiments illustrate that RepCodec, by virtue of its enhanced information retention capacity, significantly outperforms the widely used k-means clustering approach in both speech understanding and generation. Furthermore, this superiority extends across various speech encoders and languages, affirming the robustness of RepCodec. We believe our method can facilitate large language modeling research on speech processing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Child Vocalization Classification with Phonetically-Tuned Embeddings for Assisting Autism Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The assessment of children at risk of autism typically involves a clinician observing, taking notes, and rating children's behaviors. A machine learning model that can label adult and child audio may largely save labor in coding children's behaviors, helping clinicians capture critical events and better communicate with parents. In this study, we leverage Wav2Vec 2.0 (W2V2), pre-trained on 4300-hour of home audio of children under 5 years old, to build a unified system for tasks of clinician-child speaker diarization and vocalization classification (VC). To enhance children's VC, we build a W2V2 phoneme recognition system for children under 4 years old, and we incorporate its phonetically-tuned embeddings as auxiliary features or recognize pseudo phonetic transcripts as an auxiliary task. We test our method on two corpora (Rapid-ABC and BabbleCor) and obtain consistent improvements. Additionally, we outperform the state-of-the-art performance on the reproducible subset of BabbleCor.

      <title>RECAP: Retrieval-Augmented Audio Captioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RECAP (REtrieval-Augmented Audio CAPtioning), a novel and effective audio captioning system that generates captions conditioned on an input audio and other captions similar to the audio retrieved from a datastore. Additionally, our proposed method can transfer to any domain without the need for any additional fine-tuning. To generate a caption for an audio sample, we leverage an audio-text model CLAP to retrieve captions similar to it from a replaceable datastore, which are then used to construct a prompt. Next, we feed this prompt to a GPT-2 decoder and introduce cross-attention layers between the CLAP encoder and GPT-2 to condition the audio for caption generation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Clotho and AudioCaps, show that RECAP achieves competitive performance in in-domain settings and significant improvements in out-of-domain settings. Additionally, due to its capability to exploit a large text-captions-only datastore in a training-free fashion, RECAP shows unique capabilities of captioning novel audio events never seen during training and compositional audios with multiple events. To promote research in this space, we also release 150,000+ new weakly labeled captions for AudioSet, AudioCaps, and Clotho.</description>

      <title>Reacting like Humans: Incorporating Intrinsic Human Behaviors into NAO through Sound-Based Reactions to Fearful and Shocking Events for Enhanced Sociability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots' acceptability among humans and their sociability can be significantly enhanced by incorporating human-like reactions. Humans can react to environmental events very quickly and without thinking. An instance where humans show natural reactions is when they encounter a sudden and loud sound that startles or frightens them. During such moments, individuals may instinctively move their hands, turn toward the origin of the sound, and try to determine the event's cause. This inherent behavior motivated us to explore this less-studied part of social robotics. In this work, a multi-modal system composed of an action generator, sound classifier, and YOLO object detector was designed to sense the environment and, in the presence of sudden loud sounds, show natural human fear reactions; and finally, locate the fear-causing sound source in the environment. These valid generated motions and inferences could imitate intrinsic human reactions and enhance the sociability of robots. For motion generation, a model based on LSTM and MDN networks was proposed to synthesize various motions. Also, in the case of sound detection, a transfer learning model was preferred that used the spectrogram of the sound signals as its input. After developing individual models for sound detection, motion generation, and image recognition, they were integrated into a comprehensive "fear" module implemented on the NAO robot. Finally, the fear module was tested in practical application and two groups of experts and non-experts (in the robotics area) filled out a questionnaire to evaluate the performance of the robot. We indicated that the proposed module could convince the participants that the Nao robot acts and reasons like a human when a sudden and loud sound is in the robot's peripheral environment, and additionally showed that non-experts have higher expectations about social robots and their performance.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Self-Supervised Speech Models on Children's Speech and Infant Vocalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand why self-supervised learning (SSL) models have empirically achieved strong performances on several speech-processing downstream tasks, numerous studies have focused on analyzing the encoded information of the SSL layer representations in adult speech. Limited work has investigated how pre-training and fine-tuning affect SSL models encoding children's speech and vocalizations. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by probing SSL models on two relevant downstream tasks: (1) phoneme recognition (PR) on the speech of adults, older children (8-10 years old), and younger children (1-4 years old), and (2) vocalization classification (VC) distinguishing cry, fuss, and babble for infants under 14 months old. For younger children's PR, the superiority of fine-tuned SSL models is largely due to their ability to learn features that represent older children's speech and then adapt those features to the speech of younger children. For infant VC, SSL models pre-trained on large-scale home recordings learn to leverage phonetic representations at middle layers, and thereby enhance the performance of this task.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Factors: Explainable AI for Feature Boosting in Speech Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has gained significant attention due to its several application fields, such as mental health, education, and human-computer interaction. However, the accuracy of SER systems is hindered by high-dimensional feature sets that may contain irrelevant and redundant information. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes an iterative feature boosting approach for SER that emphasizes feature relevance and explainability to enhance machine learning model performance. Our approach involves meticulous feature selection and analysis to build efficient SER systems. In addressing our main problem through model explainability, we employ a feature evaluation loop with Shapley values to iteratively refine feature sets. This process strikes a balance between model performance and transparency, which enables a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictions. The proposed approach offers several advantages, including the identification and removal of irrelevant and redundant features, leading to a more effective model. Additionally, it promotes explainability, facilitating comprehension of the model's predictions and the identification of crucial features for emotion determination. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on the SER benchmarks of the Toronto emotional speech set (TESS), Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EMO-DB), Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS), and Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE) datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate model explainability into an SER framework.

      <title>Efficiently Train ASR Models that Memorize Less and Perform Better with Per-core Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient clipping plays a vital role in training large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. It is typically applied to minibatch gradients to prevent gradient explosion, and to the individual sample gradients to mitigate unintended memorization. This work systematically investigates the impact of a specific granularity of gradient clipping, namely per-core clip-ping (PCC), across training a wide range of ASR models. We empirically demonstrate that PCC can effectively mitigate unintended memorization in ASR models. Surprisingly, we find that PCC positively influences ASR performance metrics, leading to improved convergence rates and reduced word error rates. To avoid tuning the additional hyperparameter introduced by PCC, we further propose a novel variant, adaptive per-core clipping (APCC), for streamlined optimization. Our findings highlight the multifaceted benefits of PCC as a strategy for robust, privacy-forward ASR model training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale universal speech models (USM) are already used in production. However, as the model size grows, the serving cost grows too. Serving cost of large models is dominated by model size that is why model size reduction is an important research topic. In this work we are focused on model size reduction using weights only quantization. We present the weights binarization of USM Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) and show that its model size can be reduced by 15.9x times at cost of word error rate (WER) increase by only 1.9% in comparison to the float32 model. It makes it attractive for practical applications.</description>
