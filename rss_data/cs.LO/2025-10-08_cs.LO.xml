      <title>On the Interplay of Cube Learning and Dependency Schemes in QCDCL Proof Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantified Conflict Driven Clause Leaning (QCDCL) is one of the main approaches to solving Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). Cube-learning is employed in this approach to ensure that true formulas can be verified. Dependency Schemes help to detect spurious dependencies that are implied by the variable ordering in the quantifier prefix of QBFs but are not essential for constructing (counter)models. This detection can provably shorten refutations in specific proof systems, and is expected to speed up runs of QBF solvers.
  The simplest underlying proof system [BeyersdorffB\"ohm-LMCS2023], formalises the reasoning in the QCDCL approach on false formulas, when neither cube learning nor dependency schemes is used. The work of [B\"ohmPeitlBeyersdorff-AI2024] further incorporates cube-learning. The work of [ChoudhuryMahajan-JAR2024] incorporates a limited use of dependency schemes, but without cube-learning.
  In this work, proof systems underlying the reasoning of QCDCL solvers which use cube learning, and which use dependency schemes at all stages, are formalised. Sufficient conditions for soundness and completeness are presented, and it is shown that using the standard and reflexive resolution path dependency schemes ($D^{std}$ and $D^{rrs}$) to relax the decision order provably shortens refutations.
  When the decisions are restricted to follow quantification order, but dependency schemes are used in propagation and learning, in conjunction with cube-learning, the resulting proof systems using the dependency schemes $D^{std}$ and $D^{rrs}$ are investigated in detail and their relative strengths are analysed.</description>

      <title>On Equivalent Characterizations of NP in Abstract Models of Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate machine models similar to Turing machines that are augmented by the operations of a first-order structure $\mathcal{R}$, and we show that under weak conditions on $\mathcal{R}$, the complexity class $\text{NP}(\mathcal{R})$ may be characterized in three equivalent ways: (1) by polynomial-time verification algorithms implemented on $\mathcal{R}$-machines, (2) by the $\text{NP}(\mathcal{R})$-complete problem $\text{SAT}(\mathcal{R})$, and (3) by existential second-order metafinite logic over $\mathcal{R}$ via descriptive complexity. By characterizing $\text{NP}(\mathcal{R})$ in these three ways, we extend previous work and embed it in one coherent framework.
  Some conditions on $\mathcal{R}$ must be assumed in order to achieve the above trinity because there are infinite-vocabulary structures for which $\text{NP}(\mathcal{R})$ does not have a complete problem. Surprisingly, even in these cases, we show that $\text{NP}(\mathcal{R})$ does have a characterization in terms of existential second-order metafinite logic, suggesting that descriptive complexity theory is well suited to working with infinite-vocabulary structures, such as real vector spaces.
  In addition, we derive similar results for $\exists\mathcal{R}$, the constant-free Boolean part of $\text{NP}(\mathcal{R})$, by showing that $\exists\mathcal{R}$ may be characterized in three analogous ways. We then extend our results to the entire polynomial hierarchy over $\mathcal{R}$ and to its constant-free Boolean counterpart, the Boolean hierarchy over $\mathcal{R}$. Finally, we give a characterization of the polynomial and Boolean hierarchies over $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of oracle $\mathcal{R}$-machines.</description>

      <title>A Timed Obstruction Logic for Dynamic Game Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time cybersecurity and privacy applications require reliable verification methods and system design tools to ensure their correctness. Many of these reactive real-time applications embedded in various infrastructures, such as airports, hospitals, and oil pipelines, are potentially vulnerable to malicious cyber-attacks. Recently, a growing literature has recognized Timed Game Theory as a sound theoretical foundation for modeling strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. This paper proposes Timed Obstruction Logic (TOL), an extension of Obstruction Logic (OL), a formalism for verifying specific timed games with real-time objectives unfolding in dynamic models. These timed games involve players whose discrete and continuous actions can impact the underlying timed game model. We show that TOL can be used to describe important timed properties of real-time cybersecurity games. Finally, in addition to introducing our new logic and adapting it to specify properties in the context of cybersecurity, we provide a verification procedure for TOL and show that its complexity is PSPACE-complete, meaning that it is not higher than that of classical timed temporal logics like TCTL. Thus, we increase the expressiveness of properties without incurring any cost in terms of complexity.</description>

      <title>Analog and Symbolic Computation through the Koopman Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Koopman operator framework for studying the {computational properties} of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that the resolvent of the Koopman operator provides a natural abstraction of halting, yielding a ``Koopman halting problem that is recursively enumerable in general. For symbolic systems, such as those defined on Cantor space, this operator formulation captures the reachability between clopen sets, while for equicontinuous systems we prove that the Koopman halting problem is decidable. Our framework demonstrates that absorbing (halting) states {in finite automata} correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one, while cycles in the transition graph impose algebraic constraints on spectral properties. These results provide a unifying perspective on computation in symbolic and analog systems, showing how computational universality is reflected in operator spectra, invariant subspaces, and algebraic structures. Beyond symbolic dynamics, this operator-theoretic lens opens pathways to analyze {computational power of} a broader class of dynamical systems, including polynomial and analog models, and suggests that computational hardness may admit dynamical signatures in terms of Koopman spectral structure.</description>

      <title>Deciding the Existence of Interpolants and Definitions in First-Order Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: None of the first-order modal logics between $\mathsf{K}$ and $\mathsf{S5}$ under the constant domain semantics enjoys Craig interpolation or projective Beth definability, even in the language restricted to a single individual variable. It follows that the existence of a Craig interpolant for a given implication or of an explicit definition for a given predicate cannot be directly reduced to validity as in classical first-order and many other logics. Our concern here is the decidability and computational complexity of the interpolant and definition existence problems. We first consider two decidable fragments of first-order modal logic $\mathsf{S5}$: the one-variable fragment $\mathsf{Q^1S5}$ and its extension $\mathsf{S5}_{\mathcal{ALC}^u}$ that combines $\mathsf{S5}$ and the description logic$\mathcal{ALC}$ with the universal role. We prove that interpolant and definition existence in $\mathsf{Q^1S5}$ and $\mathsf{S5}_{\mathcal{ALC}^u}$ is decidable in coN2ExpTime, being 2ExpTime-hard, while uniform interpolant existence is undecidable. These results transfer to the two-variable fragment $\mathsf{FO^2}$ of classical first-order logic without equality. We also show that interpolant and definition existence in the one-variable fragment $\mathsf{Q^1K}$ of first-order modal logic $\mathsf{K}$ is non-elementary decidable, while uniform interpolant existence is again undecidable.</description>

      <title>Effect Algebras as Omega-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how an effect algebra $\mathcal{X}$ can be regarded as a category, where the morphisms $x \rightarrow y$ are the elements $f$ such that $x \leq f \leq y$. This gives an embedding $\mathbf{EA} \rightarrow \mathbf{Cat}$. The interval $[x,y]$ proves to be an effect algebra in its own right, so $\mathcal{X}$ is an $\mathbf{EA}$-enriched category. The construction can therefore be repeated, meaning that every effect algebra can be identified with a strict $\omega$-category. We describe explicitly the strict $\omega$-category structure for two classes of operators on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>What Monads Can and Cannot Do with a Few Extra Pages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delay monad provides a way to introduce general recursion in type theory. To write programs that use a wide range of computational effects directly in type theory, we need to combine the delay monad with the monads of these effects. Here we present a first systematic study of such combinations.

We study both the coinductive delay monad and its guarded recursive cousin, giving concrete examples of combining these with well-known computational effects. We also provide general theorems stating which algebraic effects distribute over the delay monad, and which do not. Lastly, we salvage some of the impossible cases by considering distributive laws up to weak bisimilarity.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of composition methods in logic (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a categorical theory of the composition methods in finite model theory -- a key technique enabling modular reasoning about complex structures by building them out of simpler components. The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models.
  Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads.
  We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.
  This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</description>

      <title>Branch Sequentialization in Quantum Polytime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms leverage the use of quantumly-controlled data in order to achieve computational advantage. This implies that the programs use constructs depending on quantum data and not just classical data such as measurement outcomes. Current compilation strategies for quantum control flow involve compiling the branches of a quantum conditional, either in-depth or in-width, which in general leads to circuits of exponential size. This problem is coined as the branch sequentialization problem. We introduce and study a compilation technique for avoiding branch sequentialization on a language that is sound and complete for quantum polynomial time, thus, improving on existing polynomial-size-preserving compilation techniques.</description>

      <title>Fracterm Calculus for Partial Meadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial algebras and datatypes are discussed with the use of signatures that allow partial functions, and a three-valued short-circuit (sequential) first order logic with a Tarski semantics. The propositional part of this logic is also known as McCarthy calculus and has been studied extensively.
  Axioms for the fracterm calculus of partial meadows are given. The case is made that in this way a rather natural formalisation of fields with division operator is obtained. It is noticed that the logic thus obtained cannot express that division by zero must be undefined.
  An interpretation of the three-valued sequential logic into $\bot$-enlargements of partial algebras is given, for which it is concluded that the consequence relation of the former logic is semi-computable, and that the $\bot$-enlargement of a partial meadow is a common meadow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a language for representing the pulse schedules that a superconducting quantum computer accepts as input. The language is a graded modal type theory named PSTT (Pulse Schedule Type Theory). Graded modals type theories are type systems where each variable is annotated with a parameter or grade. These can be used to represent, for example, resource usage, where the grade denotes how many times a given resource may be used; or privacy levels, whether a resource is private or public. In this system, we use the grades to represent timing information. We give categorical semantics to the system and prove soundness and completeness.</description>

      <title>On classes of bounded tree rank, their interpretations, and efficient sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph classes of bounded tree rank were introduced recently in the context of the model checking problem for first-order logic of graphs. These graph classes are a common generalization of graph classes of bounded degree and bounded treedepth, and they are a special case of graph classes of bounded expansion. We introduce a notion of decomposition for these classes and show that these decompositions can be efficiently computed. Also, a natural extension of our decomposition leads to a new characterization and decomposition for graph classes of bounded expansion (and an efficient algorithm computing this decomposition).
  We then focus on interpretations of graph classes of bounded tree rank. We give a characterization of graph classes interpretable in graph classes of tree rank $2$. Importantly, our characterization leads to an efficient sparsification procedure: For any graph class $C$ interpretable in a efficiently bounded graph class of tree rank at most $2$, there is a polynomial time algorithm that to any $G \in C$ computes a (sparse) graph $H$ from a fixed graph class of tree rank at most $2$ such that $G = I(H)$ for a fixed interpretation $I$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient "interpretation reversal" result that generalizes the result of Gajarsk\'y et al. [LICS 2016], who showed an analogous result for graph classes interpretable in classes of graphs of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>An algebra modality admitting countably many deriving transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category, that is, a symmetric monoidal category enriched over commutative monoids, with an algebra modality, axiomatizing smooth functions, and a deriving transformation on this algebra modality, axiomatizing differentiation. Lemay proved that a comonoidal algebra modality has at most one deriving transformation, thus differentiation is unique in models of differential linear logic. It was then an open problem whether this result extends to arbitrary algebra modalities. We answer this question in the negative. We build a free "commutative rig with a self-map" algebra modality on the category of commutative monoids, where the self-map can be seen as an arbitrary smooth function. We then define a countable family of distinct deriving transformations $({}_{n}\mathsf{d})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this algebra modality where the parameter $n$ controls the derivative of the self-map. It shows that in a differential category, a single algebra modality may admit multiple, inequivalent notions of differentiation.</description>
