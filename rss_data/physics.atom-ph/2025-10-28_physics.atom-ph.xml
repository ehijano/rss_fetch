      <title>Direct Measurement of the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ Decay Rate in Strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decay process $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$ in a magneto-optical trap of Sr atoms operating on the $461\,\mathrm{nm}$ ($5s^2\,{}^1S_0 - 5s5p\,{}^1P_1$) transition by irradiating the trapped atoms with laser light resonant with the $448\,\mathrm{nm}$ ($5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s8p\,{}^1P_1$) transition and observing the transient response of atom fluorescence. We measure, for the first time, the branching ratio of the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$ transition to be $0.177(4)$, which significantly deviates from the widely cited theoretical value of $0.322$ [C. W. Bauschlicher Jr. et al., J. Phys. B 18, 1523 (1985)]. Moreover, we determine the decay rate of the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ transition to be $5.3(5)\times10^3\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, consistent within uncertainty with the widely cited experimental value [L. R. Hunter et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 56, 823 (1986)], but substantially lower than the recent theoretical value of $9.25(40)\times10^3\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ [A. Cooper et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 041055 (2018)]. These findings have significant implications for laser cooling of Sr and fluorescence detection of single atoms in optical tweezers. They also call for a reevaluation of theoretical frameworks used to calculate transition rates essential for evaluating blackbody radiation shifts in the Sr optical atomic clock.</description>

      <title>Tensor gravity gradiometry with a single-axis atom gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for using a single-axis atom interferometric gravity gradiometer to measure off-diagonal elements of the gravity gradient tensor. By tilting the gradiometer, the measured gradient becomes a linear combination of different components of the gravity gradient tensor, and through multiple measurements at different tilts the separate tensor components can be inferred. We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of this technique, both for terrestrial surveys where the tilt is statically set by the user and for surveys where a strapdown sensor is dynamically tilted by the motion of the platform. We show that the gradiometer's sensitivity to the vertical gravity gradient is only slightly reduced by this method while allowing for more gradiometer information to be obtained. Major sources of error and loss of sensitivity on dynamic platforms are shown to be mitigated using an optical-gimbal technique employing commercially-available fibre-optic gyroscopes and tip-tilt mirrors.</description>

      <title>Vibronic coupling limits the use of high-lying electronic states in complex molecules for laser cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling of large, complex molecules is a long-standing goal, instrumental for enabling new quantum technology and precision measurements. A primary consideration for the feasibility of laser cooling, which determines the efficiency and technical requirements of the process, is the number of excited-state decay pathways leading to vibrational excitations. Therefore, the assessment of the laser-cooling potential of a molecule begins with estimate of the vibrational branching ratios of the first few electronic excited states theoretically to find the optimum cooling scheme. Such calculations, typically done within the BO and harmonic approximations, have suggested that one leading candidate for large, polyatomic molecule laser cooling, alkaline earth phenoxides, can most efficiently be laser-cooled via the third electronically excited C state. Here, we report the first detailed spectroscopic characterization of the C state in CaOPh and SrOPh. We find that nonadiabatic couplings between the A, B, and C states lead to substantial mixing, giving rise to vibronic states that enable additional decay pathways. Based on the intensity ratio of these extra decay channels, we estimate a non-adiabatic coupling strength of 0.1 cm-1. While this coupling strength is small, the large density of vibrational states available at photonic energy scales in a polyatomic molecule leads to significant mixing. Thus, this result is expected to be general for large molecules and implies that only the lowest electronic excited state should be considered when judging the suitability of a molecule for laser cooling.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited potential energy surfaces for CaF+Ca interactions and isotope exchange reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intermolecular interactions between laser-cooled CaF and Ca, in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand atom-exchange reaction pathways. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods, we compute potential energy surfaces for nine electronic states arising from the lowest three asymptotes of Ca$_2$F trimer, within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Two-dimensional potential energy surfaces are computed for the ground state and one of the excited states. We use a combination of the coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, and the multireference configuration interaction method with single and double excitations. The ground (X)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$ electronic state of the trimer is significantly deep and highly anisotropic. The excited electronic states are also strongly bound. Notably, the potential energy surface of one of the excited states, (2)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$, lies below the ground-state asymptote of the trimer. By analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss atom-exchange reaction pathways involving both the ground-state interaction between CaF and Ca and the excited metastable state of Ca.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Study of Surface Wettability Effects on Pool Boiling of Water over Nanoscale Aluminum Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were used to study pool boiling of water films on an ultra-thin planar aluminum substrate as well as the effect of surface wettability. The simulation geometry is a 10 nm-thick water film on an FCC aluminum substrate heated from 300 K to 900 K. The first peak acceleration onset time of the film, as the measure of the nucleation start, has been observed. The average heating rates of the near-wall water were 0.064, 0.048, and 0.035 K/ps for hydrophilic, neutral, and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. Boiling curves shows that the critical heat flux (CHF) equals 5216, 3979, and 2525 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 466, 502, and 561 K, respectively. The minimum heat flux (MHF, Leidenfrost point) is equal to 2157, 2463, and 2366 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 767, 784, and 746 K, respectively. Interfacial HTC remains higher for longer times under the hydrophilic condition, whereas Kapitza resistance is low initially but then increases sharply after transition to film boiling with the highest values for the hydrophobic surface. In general, the results demonstrate that engineering aluminum wettability towards intense hydrophilicity diminishes the explosive boiling point, increases CHF, and enhances nanoscale thermal management performance.</description>

      <title>Control of Valence Electron Motion in Xe Cation Using Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates possibilities of using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and its variants to control a coherent superposition of quantum states. We present a generalization of the so-called fractional STIRAP (f-STIRAP), demonstrating precise control over the mixing ratio of quantum states in the wave packet. In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussians envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence. We apply our developed techniques to control the ultrafast charge migration in the spin-orbit split ground electronic states of xenon cation via intermediate valence- and core-excited states. Finally, we propose concrete experimental realizations of the developed control schemes in combination with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a method to probe the system.</description>

      <title>Coupling-induced universal dynamics in bilayer two-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of order in many-body systems and the associated self-similar dynamics governed by dynamical scaling laws is a hallmark of universality far from equilibrium. Measuring and classifying such nontrivial behavior for novel symmetry classes remains challenging. Here, we realize a well-controlled interlayer coupling quench in a tunable bilayer two-dimensional Bose gas, driving the system to an ordered phase. We observe robust self-similar dynamics and a universal critical exponent consistent with diffusion-like coarsening, driven by vortex and antivortex annihilation induced by the interlayer coupling. Our results extend the understanding of universal dynamics in many-body systems and provide a robust foundation for quantitative tests of nonequilibrium effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Spin-selective coherent light scattering from ion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study coherent light scattering from linear crystals with up to twelve $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions, acting as single photon emitters. Light-scattering is induced by two-photon laser excitation, starting from the S$_{1/2}\rightarrow$ D$_{5/2}$ quadrupole transition at 729~nm followed by the D$_{5/2}\rightarrow$ P$_{3/2}$ dipole transition at 854~nm, from where the ions decay back to the S$_{1/2}$ ground state via emission of a photon near 393~nm. We realize spin-selective excitation from the Zeeman-split ground states S$_{1/2}$, m$= \pm 1/2$, of the $\text{Ca}^+$ ions and observe in the far field spin-dependent interference patterns displaying the spin textures of the ion crystals. We investigate their dynamics by measuring the temporal evolution of the spatial Fourier frequencies of the observed patterns.</description>

      <title>Light shift suppression in a CPT magnetometer using linear polarization and double frequency interrogation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a suppression of the light shift in a Coherent-Population-Trapping (CPT) atomic magnetometer by using linearly polarized light and a differential measurement between magnetic resonances. The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light. Various limitations to the method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Single-bounce quantum gravimeter to measure the free-fall of anti-hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative concept for a quantum gravimeter, where atoms prepared in a Heisenberg-limited state perform a single bounce on a mirror followed by a free fall. This quantum gravimeter produces a simple and robust interference pattern which should allow to measure the free-fall acceleration of atoms. We estimate the expected accuracy of the measurement in the GBAR experiment, which aims at testing the equivalence principle on anti-hydrogen at CERN antimatter facilities. Using simulations and estimation techniques based on Cramer-Rao law and Fisher information, we show that the new quantum sensor improves the expected accuracy of the measurement. The proposal opens the door to free fall measurements on rare or exotic atomic species, especially in situations where experimental time or detection events are limited by intrinsic physical reasons.</description>
