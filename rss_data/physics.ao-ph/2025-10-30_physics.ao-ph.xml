      <title>Reflecting on a Decade of Formalized Tornado Emergencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1999 the NWS began using the phrase "tornado emergency" to denote tornado warnings for storms with the potential to cause rare, catastrophic damage. After years of informal usage, tornado emergencies were formally introduced to 46 weather forecasting offices in 2014 as part of the impact-based warning (IBW) program, with a nationwide rollout occurring over the following years. In concert with the new tiered warning approach, the Warning Decision Training Division (WDTD) also introduced suggested criteria for when forecasters should consider upgrading a tornado warning to a tornado emergency, which includes thresholds of rotational velocity (VROT) and significant tornado parameter (STP). Although significant research has studied both tornado forecasting and tornado warning dissemination in the decade since, relatively little work has examined the effectiveness of the tornado emergency specifically. Our analysis of all 89 IBW tornado emergencies issued from 2014-2023 found that forecasters do not appear to follow suggested criteria for issuance in the majority of cases, with only two tornado emergencies meeting both VROT and STP thresholds. Regardless, 70% of tornado emergencies were issued for EF-3+ tornadoes and tornado emergencies covered 55% of all EF-4 tornadoes as well as 41% of all tornadoes resulting in 3 or more fatalities. Based on these results, we propose several updates to the current NWS training materials for impact-based tornado warnings.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Extreme Precipitation Forecasts: A Threshold-Weighted, Spatial Verification Approach for Comparing an AI Weather Prediction Model Against a High-Resolution NWP Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather prediction have led to the development of artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models with competitive forecast skill compared to traditional NWP models, but with substantially reduced computational cost. There is a strong need for appropriate methods to evaluate their ability to predict extreme weather events, particularly when spatial coherence is important, and grid resolutions differ between models.
  We introduce a verification framework that combines spatial verification methods and proper scoring rules. Specifically, the framework extends the High-Resolution Assessment (HiRA) approach with threshold-weighted scoring rules. It enables user-oriented evaluation consistent with how forecasts may be interpreted by operational meteorologists or used in simple post-processing systems. The method supports targeted evaluation of extreme events by allowing flexible weighting of the relative importance of different decision thresholds. We demonstrate this framework by evaluating 32 months of precipitation forecasts from an AIWP model and a high-resolution NWP model. Our results show that model rankings are sensitive to the choice of neighbourhood size. Increasing the neighbourhood size has a greater impact on scores evaluating extreme-event performance for the high-resolution NWP model than for the AIWP model. At equivalent neighbourhood sizes, the high-resolution NWP model only outperformed the AIWP model in predicting extreme precipitation events at short lead times. We also demonstrate how this approach can be extended to evaluate discrimination ability in predicting heavy precipitation. We find that the high-resolution NWP model had superior discrimination ability at short lead times, while the AIWP model had slightly better discrimination ability from a lead time of 24-hours onwards.</description>

      <title>The representation of Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves and upscale energy transfer in models with explicit and parametrized convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves (CCEWs) dominate atmospheric variability on timescales of 2--30 days in the Tropics, bringing episodes of widespread heavy precipitation. This study compares the representation of CCEWs and their connection to upscale energy transfer in two Met Office Unified Model simulations of the full tropical channel with identical km-scale resolution. The principal difference between the simulations is that one parametrizes convection (GAL), while the other (RAL) is convection permitting. This means GAL acts to remove vertical instability without explicitly representing the resolved-scale circulation associated with convective plumes. We present the first quantitative diagnosis of interscale energy transfer and its relation to CCEWs. This diagnosis is important because upscale energy transfer between convection and large-scale waves may influence accurate simulation and predictability of tropical weather systems. The average upper-tropospheric upscale transfer simulated by RAL is approximately 50\% higher than GAL. CCEWs are more coherent in RAL, with an average phase-speed variability 80\% higher than observations, compared with 166\% higher in GAL. RAL also simulates greater upscale energy transfer within waves than GAL, with a stronger correlation between the interscale energy transfer rate and equatorial wave winds. Simulated Kelvin and Rossby waves are associated with upscale energy transfer from scales 2--8 times smaller than the dominant wavelength, related to active deep convection within a particular sector of the wave phase. Our findings show that the explicit representation of convective motions has a significant impact on the simulation of upscale energy transfer, and is therefore very likely to be a significant factor in the faithful simulation of the convective coupling within CCEWs.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic vs dynamic representation of the inverse barometer effect in a global ocean model and its potential for probabilistic storm surge forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global ocean model NEMO is run in a series of stand-alone configurations (2015-2022) to investigate the potential for improving global medium-range storm surge forecasts by including the inverse barometer effect. Here, we compare a control experiment, where the inverse barometer effect was not included, against a run dynamically forced with mean sea level pressure. In the control experiment, the inverse barometer effect was then calculated diagnostically and added to the ocean model sea surface elevation, resulting in a total of three experiments to investigate. We compare against the global GESLA3 water level data set and find that the inclusion of the inverse barometer effect reduces the root-mean-square error by $\sim 1~cm$ on average. When we mask out all data where the observed storm surge is less than $\pm1$ or $\pm2$ standard deviations, including the inverse barometer effect reduces the RMS error by $4-5$ cm. While both methods reduce water level errors, there are regional differences in their performance. The run with dynamical pressure forcing is seen to perform slightly better than diagnostically adding the inverse barometer effect in enclosed basins such as the Baltic Sea. Finally, an ensemble forecast experiment with the Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts demonstrates that when the diagnostic inverse barometer effect is included for a severe storm surge event in the North Sea (Storm Xaver, December 2013), the ensemble spread of water level provides a stronger and earlier indication of the observed maximum surge level than the when the effect is excluded.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Storms in an Idealized Climate Revealed by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The midlatitude climate and weather are shaped by storms, yet the factors governing their predictability remain insufficiently understood. Here, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict and quantify uncertainty in the intensity growth and trajectory of over 200,000 storms simulated in a 200-year aquaplanet GCM. This idealized framework provides a controlled climate background for isolating factors that govern predictability. Results show that storm intensity is less predictable than trajectory. Strong baroclinicity accelerates storm intensification and reduces its predictability, consistent with theory. Crucially, enhanced jet meanders further degrade forecast skill, revealing a synoptic source of uncertainty. Using sensitivity maps from explainable AI, we find that the error growth rate is nearly doubled by the more meandering structure. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning for advancing understanding of predictability and its governing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Hydrogen and Helium: From Planetary Embryos to Earth- and Neptune-like Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen, helium, silicates, and iron are key building blocks of rocky and gas-rich planets, yet their chemical interactions remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we quantify hydrogen and helium partitioning between molten silicate mantles and metallic cores for Earth-to-Neptune-mass planets. Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds.</description>

      <title>On a wave kinetic equation with resonance broadening in oceanography and atmospheric sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a three-wave kinetic equation with resonance broadening arising from the theory of stratified ocean flows. Unlike Gamba-Smith-Tran(On the wave turbulence theory for stratified flows in the ocean, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 30 (2020), no.1, 105--137), we employ a different formulation of the resonance broadening, which makes the present model more suitable for ocean applications. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the new resonance broadening kinetic equation.</description>

      <title>Automated Supervised Identification of Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs) are bursts of high-energy particle fluxes detected at Earth's surface, linked to the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche (RREA) mechanism within thunderclouds. Accurate detection of TGEs is vital for advancing atmospheric physics and radiation safety, but event selection methods heavily rely on expert-defined thresholds. In this study, we use an automated supervised classification approach on a newly curated dataset of 2024 events from the Aragats Space Environment Center (ASEC). By combining a Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) with SHAP-based interpretability, we attain 94.79% classification accuracy with 96% precision for TGEs. The analysis reveals data-driven thresholds for particle flux increases and environmental parameters that closely match the empirically established criteria used over the last 15 years. Our results demonstrate that modest but concurrent increases across multiple particle detectors, along with strong near-surface electric fields, are reliable indicators of TGEs. The framework we propose offers a scalable method for automated, interpretable TGE detection, with potential uses in real-time radiation hazard monitoring and multi-site atmospheric research.</description>

      <title>Leveraging an Atmospheric Foundational Model for Subregional Sea Surface Temperature Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models; however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of 0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx 0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.</description>

      <title>Approximating the universal thermal climate index using sparse regression with orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>
