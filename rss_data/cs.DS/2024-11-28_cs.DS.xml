      <title>Structural Parameterization of Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structural parameterizations of two identification problems: LOCATING-DOMINATING SET and TEST COVER. In the first problem, an input is a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and an integer $k$, and one asks if there is a subset $S$ of $k$ vertices such that any two distinct vertices not in $S$ are dominated by distinct subsets of $S$. In the second problem, an input is a set of items $U$, a set of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ of $U$ called $tests$ and an integer $k$, and one asks if there is a set $S$ of at most $k$ tests such that any two items belong to distinct subsets of tests of $S$. These two problems are "identification" analogues of DOMINATING SET and SET COVER, respectively. Chakraborty et al. [ISAAC 2024] proved that both the problems admit conditional double-exponential lower bounds and matching algorithms when parameterized by treewidth of the input graph. We continue this line of investigation and consider parameters larger than treewidth, like vertex cover number and feedback edge set number. We design a nontrivial dynamic programming scheme to solve TEST COVER in "slightly super-exponential" time $2^{O(|U|\log |U|)}(|U|+|\mathcal{F}|)^{O(1)}$ in the number $|U|$ of items and LOCATING-DOMINATING SET in time $2^{O(\textsf{vc} \log \textsf{vc})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textsf{vc}$ is the vertex cover number and $n$ is the order of the graph. This shows that the lower bound results with respect to treewidth from Chakraborty et al. [ISAAC 2024] cannot be extended to vertex cover number. We also show that, parameterized by feedback edge set number, LOCATING-DOMINATING SET admits a linear kernel thereby answering an open question in [Cappelle et al., LAGOS 2021]. Finally, we show that neither LOCATING-DOMINATING SET nor TEST COVER is likely to admit a compression algorithm returning an input with a subquadratic number of bits, unless $\textsf{NP} \subseteq \textsf{coNP}/poly$.</description>

      <title>Improved Parallel Derandomization via Finite Automata with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One main genre of algorithmic derandomization comes from the construction of probability distributions with small support that fool a randomized algorithm. This is especially well-suited to parallelization, i.e. NC algorithms. A significant abstraction of these methods can be formulated in terms of fooling polynomial-space statistical tests computed via finite automata (Sivakumar 2002); this encompasses $k$-wise independence, sums of random variables, and many other properties.
  We describe new parallel algorithms to fool general finite-state automata with significantly reduced processor complexity. The analysis is also simplified because we can cleanly separate the problem-specific optimizations from the general lattice discrepancy problems at the core of the automaton-fooling construction. We illustrate with improved applications to the Gale-Berlekamp Switching Game and to approximate MAX-CUT via SDP rounding.</description>

      <title>A Faster Deterministic Algorithm for Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-Path Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with a set of terminals $T\subseteq V$ partitioned into a family $\mathcal{S}$ of disjoint blocks, find the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths whose endpoints belong to two distinct blocks while no other internal vertex is a terminal. This problem is called Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-path packing. It has been of remarkable interest as a common generalization of the non-bipartite matching and vertex-disjoint $s\text{-}t$ paths problem.
  This paper presents a new deterministic algorithm for this problem via known reduction to linear matroid parity. The algorithm utilizes the augmenting-path algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann (1986), while replacing costly matrix operations between augmentation steps with a faster algorithm that exploits the original $\mathcal{S}$-path packing instance. The proposed algorithm runs in $O(mnk)$ time, where $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$, and $k = |T|\le n$. This improves on the previous best bound $O(mn^{\omega})$ for deterministic algorithms, where $\omega\ge2$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent.</description>

      <title>Undirected 3-Fault Replacement Path in Nearly Cubic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and two vertices $s,t\in V$, the $f$-fault replacement path ($f$FRP) problem computes for every set of edges $F$ where $|F|\leq f$, the distance from $s$ to $t$ when edges in $F$ fail. A recent result shows that 2FRP in directed graphs can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time [arXiv:2209.07016]. In this paper, we show a 3FRP algorithm in deterministic $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time for undirected weighted graphs, which almost matches the size of the output. This implies that $f$FRP in undirected graphs can be solved in almost optimal $\tilde{O}(n^f)$ time for all $f\geq 3$. To construct our 3FRP algorithm, we introduce an incremental distance sensitivity oracle (DSO) with $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ worst-case update time, while preprocessing time, space, and query time are still $\tilde{O}(n^3)$, $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(1)$, respectively, which match the static DSO [Bernstein and Karger 2009]. Here in a DSO, we can preprocess a graph so that the distance between any pair of vertices given any failed edge can be answered efficiently. From the recent result in [arXiv:2211.05178], we can obtain an offline dynamic DSO from the incremental worst-case DSO, which makes the construction of our 3FRP algorithm more convenient. By the offline dynamic DSO, we can also construct a 2-fault single-source replacement path (2-fault SSRP) algorithm in $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time, that is, from a given vertex $s$, we want to find the distance to any vertex $t$ when any pair of edges fail. Thus the $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time complexity for 2-fault SSRP is also almost optimal. Now we know that in undirected graphs 1FRP can be solved in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time [Nardelli, Proietti, Widmayer 2001], and 2FRP and 3FRP in undirected graphs can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time. In this paper, we also show that a truly subcubic algorithm for 2FRP in undirected graphs does not exist under APSP-hardness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Parallel Token Swapping for Qubit Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a combinatorial reconfiguration problem that involves finding an optimal sequence of swaps to move an initial configuration of tokens that are placed on the vertices of a graph to a final desired one. This problem arises as a crucial step in reducing the depth of a quantum circuit when compiling a quantum algorithm. We provide the first known constant factor approximation algorithms for the parallel token swapping problem on graph topologies that are commonly found in modern quantum computers, including cycle graphs, subdivided star graphs, and grid graphs. We also study the so-called stretch factor of a natural lower bound to the problem, which has been shown to be useful when designing heuristics for the qubit routing problem. Finally, we study the colored version of this reconfiguration problem where some tokens share the same color and are considered indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Optimal root recovery for uniform attachment trees and $d$-regular growing trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider root-finding algorithms for random rooted trees grown by uniform attachment. Given an unlabeled copy of the tree and a target accuracy $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, such an algorithm outputs a set of nodes that contains the root with probability at least $1 - \varepsilon$. We prove that, for the optimal algorithm, an output set of size $\exp(O(\log^{1/2}(1/\varepsilon)))$ suffices; this bound is sharp and answers a question of Bubeck, Devroye and Lugosi (2017). We prove similar bounds for random regular trees that grow by uniform attachment, strengthening a result of Khim and Loh (2017).</description>

      <title>Online versus Offline Adversaries in Property Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study property testing with incomplete or noisy inputs. The models we consider allow for adversarial manipulation of the input, but differ in whether the manipulation can be done only offline, i.e., before the execution of the algorithm, or {\em online}, i.e., as the algorithm runs. The manipulations by an adversary can come in the form of erasures or corruptions. We compare the query complexity and the randomness complexity of property testing in the offline and online models. Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, and Varma (Theory Comput.`23) provide properties that can be tested with a small number of queries with offline erasures, but cannot be tested at all with online erasures. We demonstrate that the two models are incomparable in terms of query complexity: we construct properties that can be tested with a constant number of queries in the online corruption model, but require querying a significant fraction of the input in the offline erasure model. We also construct properties that exhibit a strong separation between the randomness complexity of testing in the presence of offline and online adversaries: testing these properties in the online model requires exponentially more random bits than in the offline model, even when they are tested with nearly the same number of queries in both models. Our randomness separation relies on a novel reduction from randomness-efficient testers in the adversarial online model to query-efficient testers in the standard model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parallel scan (prefix sum) algorithm in the Tensor Core Unit (TCU) model of computation. The TCU model assumes that multiplication between two square matrices of constant size $s$ is a basic operation. In the $(s^2, \ell)$-TCU model, we show that for inputs of size $n$, the algorithm has depth at most $2\lfloor \log_s (n)\rfloor$ and runs in $O(n(1 + \ell /s^2)/p + (s^2 + \ell) \log_s (n))$ time assuming $p$ tensor core units. Equivalently, the algorithm performs $O(n/s^2)$ multiplications of square matrices of size s.</description>

      <title>Improved Spectral Density Estimation via Explicit and Implicit Deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algorithms for approximating the spectral density of a symmetric matrix $A$ that is accessed through matrix-vector product queries. By combining a previously studied Chebyshev polynomial moment matching method with a deflation step that approximately projects off the largest magnitude eigendirections of $A$ before estimating the spectral density, we give an $\epsilon\cdot\sigma_\ell(A)$ error approximation to the spectral density in the Wasserstein-$1$ metric using $O(\ell\log n+ 1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products, where $\sigma_\ell(A)$ is the $\ell^{th}$ largest singular value of $A$. In the common case when $A$ exhibits fast singular value decay, our bound can be much stronger than prior work, which gives an error bound of $\epsilon \cdot ||A||_2$ using $O(1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products. We also show that it is nearly tight: any algorithm giving error $\epsilon \cdot \sigma_\ell(A)$ must use $\Omega(\ell+1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products.
  We further show that the popular Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) method matches the above bound, even though SLQ itself is parameter-free and performs no explicit deflation. This bound explains the strong practical performance of SLQ, and motivates a simple variant of SLQ that achieves an even tighter error bound. Our error bound for SLQ leverages an analysis that views it as an implicit polynomial moment matching method, along with recent results on low-rank approximation with single-vector Krylov methods. We use these results to show that the method can perform implicit deflation as part of moment matching.</description>

      <title>On the structure of normalized models of circular-arc graphs -- Hsu's approach revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular-arc graphs are the intersection graphs of arcs of a circle. The main result of this work describes the structure of all \emph{normalized intersection models} of circular-arc graphs. Normalized models of a circular-arc graph reflect the neighborhood relation between its vertices and can be seen as its canonical representations; in particular, any intersection model can be made normalized by possibly extending some of its arcs. We~devise a data-structure, called \emph{PQM-tree}, that maintains the set of all normalized models of a circular-arc graph. We show that the PQM-tree of a circular-arc graph can be computed in linear time. Finally, basing on PQM-trees, we provide a linear-time algorithm for the canonization and the isomorphism problem for circular-arc graphs.
  We describe the structure of the normalized models of circular-arc graphs using an approach proposed by Hsu~[\emph{SIAM J. Comput. 24(3), 411--439, (1995)}]. In the aforementioned work, Hsu claimed the construction of decomposition trees representing the set of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs and an $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time isomorphism algorithm for this class of graphs. However, the counterexample given in~[\emph{Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013}] shows that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is incorrect. Also, in a companion paper we show that the decomposition trees proposed by Hsu are not constructed correctly; in particular, we showed that there are circular-arc graphs whose all normalized models do not follow the description given by Hsu.</description>

Abstract: The 2024 PACE Challenge focused on the One-Sided Crossing Minimization (OCM) problem, which aims to minimize edge crossings in a bipartite graph with a fixed order in one partition and a free order in the other. We describe our OCM solver submission that utilizes various reduction rules for OCM and, for the heuristic track, employs local search approaches as well as techniques to escape local minima. The exact and parameterized solver uses an ILP formulation and branch &amp; bound to solve an equivalent Feedback Arc Set instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $(\mathcal{M},d)$ is an $n$-point metric space that embeds quasisymmetrically into a Hilbert space, then for every $\tau&gt;0$ there is a random subset $\mathcal{Z}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ such that for any pair of points $x,y\in \mathcal{M}$ with $d(x,y)\ge \tau$, the probability that both $x\in \mathcal{Z}$ and $d(y,\mathcal{Z})\ge \beta\tau/\sqrt{1+\log (|B(y,\kappa \beta \tau)|/|B(y,\beta \tau)|)}$ is $\Omega(1)$, where $\kappa&gt;1$ is a universal constant and $\beta&gt;0$ depends only on the modulus of the quasisymmetric embedding. The proof relies on a refinement of the Arora--Rao--Vazirani rounding technique. Among the applications of this result is that the largest possible Euclidean distortion of an $n$-point subset of $\ell_1$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$, and the integrality gap of the Goemans--Linial semidefinite program for the Sparsest Cut problem on inputs of size $n$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$. Multiple further applications are given.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</description>
