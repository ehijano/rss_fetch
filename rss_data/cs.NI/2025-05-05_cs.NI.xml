      <title>SeLR: Sparsity-enhanced Lagrangian Relaxation for Computation Offloading at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computational approach for offloading sensor data processing tasks to servers in edge networks for better accuracy and makespan. A task is assigned with one of several offloading options, each comprises a server, a route for uploading data to the server, and a service profile that specifies the performance and resource consumption at the server and in the network. This offline offloading and routing problem is formulated as mixed integer programming (MIP), which is non-convex and HP-hard due to the discrete decision variables associated to the offloading options. The novelty of our approach is to transform this non-convex problem into iterative convex optimization by relaxing integer decision variables into continuous space, combining primal-dual optimization for penalizing constraint violations and reweighted $L_1$-minimization for promoting solution sparsity, which achieves better convergence through a smoother path in a continuous search space. Compared to existing greedy heuristics, our approach can achieve a better Pareto frontier in accuracy and latency, scales better to larger problem instances, and can achieve a 7.72--9.17$\times$ reduction in computational overhead of scheduling compared to the optimal solver in hierarchically organized edge networks with 300 nodes and 50--100 tasks.</description>

      <title>EnviKal-Loc: Sub-10m Indoor LoRaWAN Localization using an Environmental-Aware Path Loss and Adaptive RSSI Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRaWAN technology's extensive coverage positions it as a strong contender for large-scale IoT deployments. However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.</description>

      <title>Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO in Realistic Urban Propagation Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While UE-centric cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides high and uniform throughput performance under the assumption of a uniform propagation environment modeled by the log-distance path loss channel model, the performance under a realistic urban propagation environment is not yet fully addressed. In this paper we conduct the first comparative performance study of CF-mMIMO under both the widely assumed log-distance channel model and the realistic urban propagation environment obtained via raytracing using real 3D city layouts and practical AP locations. Our results show that with the raytracing channel model, CF-mMIMO cannot achieve as high and uniform throughput performance as observed with the log-distance channel model, putting into question the attractiveness in practice of CF-mMIMO for real urban deployments.</description>

      <title>Protocol-agnostic and Data-free Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Models in RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven effective for device authentication via radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, they are hindered by domain shift issues and the scarcity of labeled data. The success of large language models has led to increased interest in unsupervised pre-trained models (PTMs), which offer better generalization and do not require labeled datasets, potentially addressing the issues mentioned above. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of PTMs in RF fingerprinting remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate data-free backdoor attacks on such PTMs in RF fingerprinting, focusing on a practical scenario where attackers lack access to downstream data, label information, and training processes. To realize the backdoor attack, we carefully design a set of triggers and predefined output representations (PORs) for the PTMs. By mapping triggers and PORs through backdoor training, we can implant backdoor behaviors into the PTMs, thereby introducing vulnerabilities across different downstream RF fingerprinting tasks without requiring prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed attack to various input domains, protocols, and PTMs. Furthermore, we explore potential detection and defense methods, demonstrating the difficulty of fully safeguarding against our proposed backdoor attack.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Distributed Routing in IoT Networks based on Multi-Objective Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last few decades have witnessed a rapid increase in IoT devices owing to their wide range of applications, such as smart healthcare monitoring systems, smart cities, and environmental monitoring. A critical task in IoT networks is sensing and transmitting information over the network. The IoT nodes gather data by sensing the environment and then transmit this data to a destination node via multi-hop communication, following some routing protocols. These protocols are usually designed to optimize possibly contradictory objectives, such as maximizing packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. While most literature has focused on optimizing a static objective that remains unchanged, many real-world IoT applications require adapting to rapidly shifting priorities. For example, in monitoring systems, some transmissions are time-critical and require a high priority on low latency, while other transmissions are less urgent and instead prioritize energy efficiency. To meet such dynamic demands, we propose novel dynamic and distributed routing based on multiobjective Q-learning that can adapt to changes in preferences in real-time. Our algorithm builds on ideas from both multi-objective optimization and Q-learning. We also propose a novel greedy interpolation policy scheme to take near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. The proposed scheme can approximate and utilize the Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic preferences, thus utilizing past knowledge to adapt to unpredictable preferences quickly during runtime. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for various exploration strategies, preference variation patterns, and important metrics like overall reward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio.</description>

      <title>SemSpaceFL: A Collaborative Hierarchical Federated Learning Framework for Semantic Communication in 6G LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, enhanced by artificial intelligence, promises ubiquitous connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These satellites are capable of collecting vast amounts of geographically diverse and real-time data, which can be immensely valuable for training intelligent models. However, limited inter-satellite communication and data privacy constraints hinder data collection on a single server for training. Therefore, we propose SemSpaceFL, a novel hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework for LEO satellite networks, with integrated semantic communication capabilities. Our framework introduces a two-tier aggregation architecture where satellite models are first aggregated at regional gateways before final consolidation at a cloud server, which explicitly accounts for satellite mobility patterns and energy constraints. The key innovation lies in our novel aggregation approach, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each satellite based on its trajectory and association with different gateways, which ensures stable model convergence despite the highly dynamic nature of LEO constellations. To further enhance communication efficiency, we incorporate semantic encoding-decoding techniques trained through the proposed HFL framework, which enables intelligent data compression while maintaining signal integrity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aggregation strategy achieves superior performance and faster convergence compared to existing benchmarks, while effectively managing the challenges of satellite mobility and energy limitations in dynamic LEO networks.</description>

      <title>Constrained Network Adversarial Attacks: Validity, Robustness, and Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has significantly advanced Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly within IoT environments where devices generate large volumes of data and are increasingly susceptible to cyber threats, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Our research reveals a critical flaw in existing adversarial attack methodologies: the frequent violation of domain-specific constraints, such as numerical and categorical limits, inherent to IoT and network traffic. This leads to up to 80.3% of adversarial examples being invalid, significantly overstating real-world vulnerabilities. These invalid examples, though effective in fooling models, do not represent feasible attacks within practical IoT deployments. Consequently, relying on these results can mislead resource allocation for defense, inflating the perceived susceptibility of IoT-enabled NIDS models to adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simpler surrogate models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) generate more valid adversarial examples compared to complex architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs. Using the MLP as a surrogate, we analyze the transferability of adversarial severity to other ML/DL models commonly used in IoT contexts. This work underscores the importance of considering both domain constraints and model architecture when evaluating and designing robust ML/DL models for security-critical IoT and network applications.</description>

      <title>A Unified QoS-Aware Multiplexing Framework for Next Generation Immersive Communication with Legacy Wireless Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immersive communication, including emerging augmented reality, virtual reality, and holographic telepresence, has been identified as a key service for enabling next-generation wireless applications. To align with legacy wireless applications, such as enhanced mobile broadband or ultra-reliable low-latency communication, network slicing has been widely adopted. However, attempting to statistically isolate the above types of wireless applications through different network slices may lead to throughput degradation and increased queue backlog. To address these challenges, we establish a unified QoS-aware framework that supports immersive communication and legacy wireless applications simultaneously. Based on the Lyapunov drift theorem, we transform the original long-term throughput maximization problem into an equivalent short-term throughput maximization weighted by virtual queue length. Moreover, to cope with the challenges introduced by the interaction between large-timescale network slicing and short-timescale resource allocation, we propose an adaptive adversarial slicing (Ad2S) scheme for networks with invarying channel statistics. To track the network channel variations, we also propose a measurement extrapolation-Kalman filter (ME-KF)-based method and refine our scheme into Ad2S-non-stationary refinement (Ad2S-NR). Through extended numerical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve 3.86 Mbps throughput improvement and 63.96% latency reduction with 24.36% convergence time reduction. Within our framework, the trade-off between total throughput and user service experience can be achieved by tuning systematic parameters.</description>

      <title>Q Cells in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given set of transmitters such as cellular base stations or WiFi access points, is it possible to analytically characterize the set of locations that are "covered" in the sense that users at these locations experience a certain minimum quality of service? In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question, by providing explicit simple outer bounds and estimates for the coverage manifold. The key geometric elements of our analytical method are the Q cells, defined as the intersections of a small number of disks. The Q cell of a transmitter is an outer bound to the service region of the transmitter, and, in turn, the union of Q cells is an outer bound to the coverage manifold. In infinite networks, connections to the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio allow for a scaling of the Q cells to obtain accurate estimates of the coverage manifold.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Communications for Visual Navigation with Edge-Aerial Collaboration in Low Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To support the Low Altitude Economy (LAE), precise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) localization in urban areas where global positioning system (GPS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based methods offer a viable alternative but face severe bandwidth, memory and processing constraints on lightweight UAVs. Inspired by mammalian spatial cognition, we propose a task-oriented communication framework, where UAVs equipped with multi-camera systems extract compact multi-view features and offload localization tasks to edge servers. We introduce the Orthogonally-constrained Variational Information Bottleneck encoder (O-VIB), which incorporates automatic relevance determination (ARD) to prune non-informative features while enforcing orthogonality to minimize redundancy. This enables efficient and accurate localization with minimal transmission cost. Extensive evaluation on a dedicated LAE UAV dataset shows that O-VIB achieves high-precision localization under stringent bandwidth budgets. Code and dataset will be made publicly available: github.com/fangzr/TOC-Edge-Aerial.</description>
