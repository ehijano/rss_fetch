      <title>What does it mean to take the mean? The effect of the averaging scale on the characterization of interstellar turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In interstellar medium studies, separating ordered and random velocity or magnetic fields is essential for interpreting turbulence in both simulations and observations. We investigate how the choice of averaging scale affects the measurement and characterization of magnetic and kinetic turbulence in Milky Way-sized disk galaxies with different initial magnetic morphologies. We analyze two magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies, one initialized with a toroidal magnetic field (Model T) and the other with a random field (Model R). Using spherical filtering, we decompose the magnetic and velocity fields into mean and fluctuating components while varying the averaging scale, and examine their energy ratios and power spectra as functions of time and averaging radius. Both models develop ordered and turbulent magnetic structures, whose relative strengths vary strongly with the averaging radius. The power spectra of the velocity and magnetic mean fields steepen with increasing smoothing scale, tracing the transition from coherent to turbulent regimes. The turbulent kinetic energy dominates over the magnetic counterpart, though the latter remains dynamically significant. Very importantly, we find that these ratios depend more strongly on the averaging radius than on the initial conditions of the magnetic field. The characterization of turbulence as strong or weak, meaning whether or not fluctuations dominate over the mean depends sensitively on the chosen averaging scale, rather than being an intrinsic property of the system. The strong dependence of the turbulence fractions on the averaging scale has direct implications for magnetic field estimates obtained from observational methods such as the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique emphasizing the need for careful scale selection when interpreting magnetic and kinetic turbulence in galaxies.</description>

      <title>CLASH-VLT velocity anisotropy profiles in a stack of massive galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the velocity anisotropy profile $\beta(r)$ of different galaxy cluster member populations by analysing the stacked projected phase space of nine massive ($M_\mathrm{200c}&gt;7\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts ($0.18 &lt; z &lt; 0.45$). We select our sample of galaxy clusters by choosing the most round and virialised objects among the targets of the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic program, which offers a large spectral database. Complementary MUSE observations on most of these clusters allowed us to identify an unprecedented number of cluster members, strongly enhancing the precision of our measurement with respect to previous studies. Our sample of cluster members is divided in four classes: red and blue by colour, and high- and low-mass by stellar mass. We employ two parallel techniques, namely the MAMPOSSt method (parametric in $\beta(r)$) and the Jeans equation inversion (non parametric in $\beta(r)$). The results from both techniques are found in agreement for any given cluster member population, and suggest that the orbital anisotropy in galaxy clusters grows from the centre (where $\beta\approx 0.2-0.4$) to the virial radius ($\beta\gtrsim 0.8$), and it is similar for the different cluster member populations. We also find an interesting dynamical feature in the Jeans inversion results, that is a drop in $\beta(r)$ at a distance of $\sim 250$ kpc from the cluster centre. We provide robust anisotropy estimates by exploring a highly significant number of model combinations: 72 with MAMPOSSt (varying the mass, surface number density, $\beta(r)$ model, and galaxy population) and 18 (varying total mass model and galaxy population) in the Jeans inversion. Such an extensive investigation of the $\beta(r)$ profile in galaxy clusters is a wide basis for future studies on cluster dynamical masses and cluster cosmology in the era of large spectroscopic surveys</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as Globular Clusters in Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($&gt;10^4$ M$_\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast$/$M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Near Galactic Centre: A Comprehensive Study of Bulge OCs HSC 25, HSC 37, HSC 2878 Utilising Gaia DR3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric and kinematic study of the open clusters HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, located in the innermost regions of the Galactic disc. Utilizing data from Gaia DR3 and the UPMASK membership algorithm, we identify 44, 55, and 112 most probable members for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The mean proper-motion components are obtained as (-5.901 +/- 0.41, -6.213 +/- 0.40), (-3.231 +/- 0.56, -4.564 +/- 0.47), and (-3.830 +/- 0.51, -5.198 +/- 0.44) mas yr^-1 for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The open clusters span a broad range of evolutionary stages, with estimated ages of log(t/yr) = 8.38 +/- 0.08, 7.04 +/- 0.09, and 9.04 +/- 0.09, and corresponding heliocentric distances of 7.36 +/- 0.37, 6.79 +/- 0.18, and 6.17 +/- 0.22 kpc. The obtained metallicities are 0.0388 +/- 0.0039, 0.0259 +/- 0.0028, and 0.0209 +/- 0.0023, respectively. Total mass estimates are 135, 755, and 204 solar masses, respectively, highlighting notable differences in stellar content across the clusters. An analysis of dynamical relaxation times suggests that HSC 25 and HSC 2878 are dynamically evolved, whereas the much younger HSC 37 is still in an early phase of dynamical evolution. The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Implications of the nanoHertz Gravitational-Wave Background for Galactic Feedback and Massive Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements of the nanoHertz gravitational-wave background (GWB) can constrain models for the growth history of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and how active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback models can affect GWB predictions. Feedback regulates supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, altering the black hole mass function (BHMF). Using BHMFs drawn from multiple cosmological simulation suites including IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS, and combining these with a quasar-based SMBH binary population framework, we predict the resulting GWB amplitude under a range of different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions. We find that the choice of both stellar and AGN feedback models alters the high-mass end of the BHMF and changes the predicted GWB amplitude by up to a factor of 2 for the fiducial simulations and a factor 10 for extreme feedback variations in CAMELS. Models with inefficient or absent AGN feedback produce abundant SMBHs and yield GWB amplitudes consistent with PTA data, yet fail in producing realistic galaxies. Fiducial models of AGN and stellar feedback suppress SMBH growth too much and under-predict the expected signal, an effect which could possibly be mitigated by more realistic black hole seeding and growth prescriptions. The mismatch between the GWB amplitudes predicted by cosmological simulations and those observed by PTAs suggests that SMBH growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current models. This demonstrates that PTA measurements provide a powerful new probe of feedback physics and the SMBH population.</description>

      <title>The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063. Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter. Or not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep JWST images of AS1063 reveals tens of thousands of globular clusters in the galaxy cluster AS1063. When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if $\sigma_{\rm SI}\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one</description>

      <title>The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: VII. Third Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR3). The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions.</description>

      <title>Gas Accretion versus BH Merger driven Growth Modes of Supermassive Black Holes and Implications for the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of central supermassive black holes in galaxies, aiming to distinguish between gas accretion versus BH merger-driven growth modes. By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion.</description>

      <title>Is the overconcentration of pristine populations in Galactic globular clusters real? An N-body approach to the problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate that in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars appear more centrally concentrated than enriched ones. This contradicts most multiple stellar population (MSP) formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched (second) population (2P) should initially be more concentrated than the pristine (first) population (1P). Previous MOCCA Monte Carlo simulations suggested that this apparent overconcentration is a transient effect arising in clusters that have lost a large fraction of their initial mass and host an active black hole subsystem (BHS), and is visible only when RGB stars are used as tracers. In this letter, we test this interpretation using tailored NBODY6++GPU models evolved with direct N-body simulations, providing an independent validation that does not rely on a statistical treatment of relaxation. We performed direct N-body simulations with the NBODY6++GPU code, adopting initial conditions designed to reproduce the dynamical regime relevant to the proposed mechanism. The simulations include updated stellar and binary evolution, dynamical interactions, and the Galactic tidal field, enabling a direct comparison with MOCCA results. The simulations confirm that the spatial distributions and kinematics inferred from RGB stars can be strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations and interactions with the BHS. Preferential ejection of 2P RGB and their progenitors from the cluster center leads to a transient apparent overconcentration of 1P RGB stars, in agreement with earlier MOCCA predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar microlensing is a powerful tool for probing dark matter in the form of planetary and stellar mass compact objects (COs), in particular primordial black holes (PBHs). Under standard assumptions, current observations exclude COs in the mass range $10^{-11} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$ making up all of the dark matter. We provide an overview, aimed at theorists working on PBHs, of the history, theory, observational status, and future prospects of the field.</description>

      <title>Early Results from the Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS): Ram Pressure Induced Shocks and Ionization in Jellyfish Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies, which exhibit tails of gas opposite to their direction of motion, are a galaxy population showcasing the most extreme effects of ram pressure stripping (RPS). We present the emission line properties of a preliminary sample of five jellyfish galaxies in the Coma cluster, observed with the WEAVE Large-IFU as part of the Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS). When complete, CLIFS will form a sample of 29 jellyfish galaxies in Coma, selected based on the presence of one-sided tails in the radio continuum, enabling a comprehensive picture of the effects of ram pressure on galaxies in the Coma cluster. We extract emission line properties and confirm consistency between disk fluxes measured from WEAVE and MaNGA for galaxies with overlapping disk coverage between surveys. Comparing resolved radio and H$\alpha$-based star formation rates, we find that, in contrast to the disk, the dominant source of tail emission is not star formation. We find evidence for diffuse ionized gas excited by RPS-driven shocks in the tails, as indicated by: (1) LINER-like tail emission with the [OI]/H$\alpha$ BPT diagnostic; (2) enhanced [OII]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tails relative to the disks; and (3) similarly elevated emission line velocities and velocity dispersions in the tails with respect to the disks. These results demonstrate that ram-pressure-driven shocks dominate the ionized emission in jellyfish galaxy tails.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XXI. JWST-NIRCam Photometric properties of protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) provides the closest example of star and planet formation in highly irradiated environments. It is a key region to study how UV radiation from massive stars drive mass-loss in protoplanetary disks through photoevaporation. Far-UV photons (6&lt;E&lt;13.6 eV) heat up the gas of the disk, forming a photodissociation region (PDRs). We use the NIRCam images from the PDRs4All program combined with those of the GTO program 1256 to extract key information on ONC disks. Specifically, the radii of the disks observed in silhouette against the bright background , the presence and positions of the dissociation fronts (DFs), the presence and positions of ionization fronts (IFs), intensities of Pa $\alpha$ lines, and their near IR SEDs. From those, we construct a typology for ONC disks: Type I show an IF and DF nearly merged at the disk surface; Type II have their DFs at the disk surface and IFs at a distance of several 10s of astronomical units from the disk; and Type III also have their DF at the disk surface, but show no IF. For all disks, we find that PAH emission traces the PDR. We establish that the SEDs of candidate JuMBOs observed as part of the PDRs4All program are similar to the SEDs of Type III ONC disks except for JuMBO24, which is of Type I or II. A detailed look at this SED shows it is compatible with a young low mass binary star with an unresolved ionized disk : a microproplyd binary. We observe that the disk radius of ONC disks increases with increasing projected distance to the ionizing source interpreted as evidence of the truncation of the disks by the photoevaporation. The disk radii measured at IR wavelengths appear larger than at millimeter wavelengths, interpreted as evidence of the dust radial segregation within the disks. The thermal pressure within the PDRs of ONC disk increases with the FUV radiation field, but with a flatter slope.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XX. Lens models of binary lens galaxies with five images of Supernova Winny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) provide a powerful way to study cosmology, SNe and galaxies. Modelling the lens system is key to extracting astrophysical and cosmological information. We present adaptive-optics-assisted high-resolution images of SN Winny (SN 2025wny) in the J and K filters obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT imaging confirms the presence of a fifth point source, whose colour is consistent with that of the other SN images at similar phases, while lens modelling robustly supports its interpretation as an additional image of SN~Winny. We measure the positions of the five SN images with uncertainties varying between 1 and 14 milliarcseconds. We build the first mass models using lenstronomy and GLEE, and explore three classes of mass models for the two lens galaxies G1 and G2. The optimal model class of the three is a singular isothermal ellipsoid for G1, a singular isothermal sphere for G2, and an external shear. We infer the enclosed masses within the Einstein radius as 4.61^{+0.06}_{-0.04} \times 10^{11}\,M_\odot for G1 and 1.01\pm0.02 \times 10^{11}\,M_\odot for G2. The lensing configuration by the two lens galaxies can produce two additional magnified SN images beyond the five observed ones; the exclusion of such model configurations further constrains the lens model parameters. Our model fits to the observed image positions with an RMS of ~0.0012" - 0.0025", within the observed positional uncertainties. The predicted magnifications of the multiple images vary between ~1.6 (for the faintest fifth image E) to ~10 (for the brightest image A). The predicted relative lensing magnifications of the multiple images do not match that of the observed within 2\sigma uncertainties. The differences in the relative magnifications could be due to millilensing/microlensing. Our mass models form the basis for future analyses of this unique system. (abridged)</description>

      <title>How Bursty is Star Formation at z&gt;5?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by observational evidence from JWST and theoretical results from cosmological simulations, we use a simple parametric, phenomenological model to test to what extent bursty star formation with standard Initial Mass Function, no continuous star formation, no mergers, \mr{and no dust} can account for the observed properties in the $M_{UV}$ vs $M_*$ plane of galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;5$. We find that the simplest model that fits the data has a quiescence period between bursts $\Delta t \sim 100$~Myrs and the stellar mass in each galaxy grows linearly as a function of time from $z=12$ to $z=5$ (i.e., repeated bursts in each galaxy produce approximately equal mass in stars). The distribution of burst masses across different galaxies follows a power-law $dN/dM_* \propto M_*^\alpha$ with slope $\alpha \sim -2$.
  At $z&gt;9-10$ the observed galaxy population typically had only one or two bursts of stars formation, hence the observed stellar masses at these redshifts (reaching $M_* \sim 10^{10}$~M$_\odot$), roughly represent the distribution of masses formed in one burst.</description>

      <title>Molecular diagnostics for the mid-infrared emission of planet-forming disks. Carbon and oxygen elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared observations of planet-forming disks reveal a wide diversity in molecular spectra. Carbon and oxygen abundances play a central role in setting the chemical environment of the inner disk and the spectral appearance. We aim to systematically explore how variations in elemental carbon and oxygen abundances affect the mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming disks, and to identify robust mid-infrared molecular diagnostics of C/H, O/H, and the C/O ratio. Using the thermochemical disk code ProDiMo and the line radiative transfer code FLiTs, we construct a grid of 25 models with varying carbon and oxygen abundances, covering a broad range of C/O ratios. We analyze the resulting mid-infrared molecular emission, including species such as $\rm H_2O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm OH$. We find that the mid-infrared molecular spectra are highly sensitive not only to the C/O ratio, but also to the absolute abundances of carbon and oxygen. Despite the same disk structure and C/O ratios, molecular fluxes (e.g., $\rm C_2H_2$, $\rm CO_2$) vary by more than an order of magnitude. This variation stems from the differences in excitation conditions and emitting regions caused by the elemental abundances of oxygen and carbon. We identify diagnostic molecular flux ratios - such as $\rm CO_2$/$\rm H_2O$ and $\rm H_2O$/$\rm C_2H_2$ - that can serve as tracers of C/H and O/H respectively. By combining these diagnostics, we demonstrate a method to infer the underlying C/O ratio. Our model grid provides a framework for interpreting mid-infrared molecular emission from disks, allowing estimates of elemental abundances if the disk properties and structure are known. Comparisons with recent JWST observations suggest that a variety in C and O abundances is seen in a sample of T Tauri disks, possibly shaped by disk transport processes and the presence of gaps.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars: Convection, Mass Loss, Nucleosynthesis, and Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first stars likely formed from pristine clouds, marking a transformative epoch after the dark ages by initiating reionisation and synthesising the first heavy elements. Among these, low-mass Population III stars are of particular interest, as their long lifespans raise the possibility that some may survive to the present day in the Milky Way's stellar halo or satellite dwarfs. As the first paper in a series, we present hydrodynamic evolutionary models for 0.7 - 1 MSun stars evolved up to the white dwarf phase, utilising the MESA software instrument. We systematically vary mass-loss efficiencies, convective transport, and overshooting prescriptions, thereby mapping how uncertain physics influences nucleosynthetic yields; surface enrichment, including nitrogen-rich post-main sequence stars arising from convective shell mergers; remnant properties, such as low-mass helium or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (M_WD ~ 0.45-0.55 MSun) and transient UV-bright phases; and potential observational signatures, including neutrino emission during shell mergers and helium flashes. These models establish a predictive framework for identifying surviving Pop III stars and their descendants, providing both evolutionary and observational constraints that were previously unexplored.</description>

      <title>Three Saturn-mass Microlensing Planets Identified through Signals from Peripheral-caustic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of three microlensing planets identified through brief positive anomalies on the wings of their light curves. The events, KMT-2021-BLG-0852, KMT-2024-BLG-2005, and KMT-2025-BLG-0481, were detected in high-cadence survey data from the KMTNet, OGLE, MOA, and PRIME collaborations. The anomaly morphologies are consistent with major-image perturbations induced by planetary-mass companions located near the peripheral caustic. A systematic exploration of model degeneracies, including binary-source scenarios, higher mass-ratio binary lenses, and the inner--outer caustic degeneracy, firmly establishes the planetary origin of each signal. Measurements of the angular Einstein radius and event timescale, combined with Bayesian priors from a Galactic model, yield the physical parameters of each system. The hosts are low-mass stars (0.12--0.75~$M_\odot$), while the companions are Saturn-mass planets (0.16--0.59 $M_{\rm J}$) projected at separations of 1.1--7.8 au, placing them beyond the snowline of their hosts. These results demonstrate the capability of microlensing to detect and characterize cold giant planets around low-mass stars at kpc distances, populating the critical transition region between ice giants and gas giants.</description>

      <title>A XRISM View of the Iron Line Complex in NGC 1068: Rethinking the Prototypical Compton-Thick AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze an XRISM/Resolve observation of NGC1068, focusing on the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ fluorescent lines and on the Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission complexes. Line centroid energies, intrinsic widths, flux ratios, and constraints on the Compton shoulder are derived through local spectral fitting, and compared with atomic calculations and theoretical predictions. The centroid energies of the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ lines tightly constrain the emitting material to be neutral or near-neutral. The observed Fe K$\beta$/K$\alpha$ ratio, together with the stringent upper limit on the Compton shoulder ($\lesssim$8--11% of the core flux), disfavour reflection dominated by a homogeneous, classical Compton-thick medium, indicating that most of the neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission arises in optically thin or moderately Compton-thick gas. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines exhibit remarkably large velocity widths, of several thousand km~s$^{-1}$. These broad profiles closely resemble the integrated optical and infrared [O III] and [O IV] lines associated with the large-scale biconical outflow, and are naturally interpreted as the X-ray signature of a more highly ionized, faster, and more spatially confined phase of the same outflow. The iron-K emission of NGC1068 reveals a stratified circumnuclear environment in which neutral and highly ionized components arise in physically distinct regions. The neutral Fe K fluorescence originates predominantly in optically thin or mildly Compton-thick material, despite the persistently Compton-thick line-of-sight obscuration, indicating a geometrically complex cold reprocessor. The highly ionized iron emission lines trace a fast component consistent with a warm bipolar outflow on parsec scales, whose large velocities and inferred energetics suggest that it may represent an efficient channel for feedback in a heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy.</description>

      <title>SPT-CL J0417-4748: A Deep Chandra Study of a Relaxed Galaxy Cluster Without Central Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth Chandra X-ray analysis of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0417$-$4748 (hereafter SPT J0417), at z = 0.58, with a focus on its thermodynamic properties and the apparent absence of central star formation. Utilizing a total Chandra exposure of 103 ks, we find that the large-scale X-ray morphology is consistent with a dynamically relaxed, cool-core system. The intracluster medium (ICM) shows a central density of 0.08+/-0.01 cm^{-3}, a central pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keVcm^{2} and a central cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr, values typical of massive cool-core clusters. Despite these conditions, no evidence of recent or ongoing star formation is detected in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of DES photometry indicates that the bulk of the stellar population formed at z~1.25, with no significant star formation over the past ~3 Gyr, while optical spectra from Magellan show no [O II] emission. Complementary ASKAP radio and Spitzer infrared data indicate a lack of strong current AGN activity in the BCG. SPT J0417 exemplifies massive, relaxed, cool-core clusters in which cooling and star formation appear almost completely quenched, providing valuable insights into how AGN feedback regulates the long-term thermal balance of the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>Localized $^{18}$O production in white dwarf mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merger of a He white dwarf (WD) and a CO WD is the favored formation channel for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. These stars exhibit ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios that are orders of magnitude lower than the solar value. However, it is not fully understood whether such low ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios can be achieved in WD merger remnants for the predicted lifetime of RCB stars of around $10^4\,\mathrm{years}$. In this work, we perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations of a 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a merger of a $0.3\,M_\odot$ He WD and a $0.6\,M_\odot$ CO WD for $4000\,\mathrm{s}$ at which point a steady state in temperature and density is reached. From this point, we follow several radial zones to study the long-term production of ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ and its variability throughout the burning region.
  We find that the asymmetric merger process leaves an imprint on the distribution of the abundances at the end of our hydrodynamic simulation. During the long-term evolution up to $100\,\mathrm{years}$, we observe ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratios of order of unity, although the timescale on which ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ is destroyed again is highly location dependent. Importantly, our calculations suggest that in the outer layers of the burning shell, the dominant production channel is $^{14}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{18}\mathrm{O}$ instead of the commonly considered $^{14}\mathrm{N}(\alpha,\gamma)^{18}\mathrm{F}(\beta^+)^{18}\mathrm{O}$ reaction, whereby the former can be sustained for longer periods of time. Furthermore, these outer regions do not reach the conditions necessary for fast $\alpha$-captures in ${^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ to ${^{22}}\mathrm{Ne}$, thus being favorable to maintaining a low ${^{16}}\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\mathrm{O}$ ratio.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Multiple Component Outflows in PG 1211+143: II. The Soft X-ray View of the Ultra Fast Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearby quasar, PG 1211+143, has one of the prototype examples of an ultra fast outflow (UFO), as seen in several past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. In December 2024, PG 1211+143 was observed simultaneously with XRISM Resolve and XMM-Newton, allowing both the Fe K and soft X-ray outflows to be examined at high resolution simultaneously. The Resolve spectrum revealed a forest of Fe K band absorption lines from the UFO (Mizumoto et al. 2026), comprising of up to six discrete velocity components ranging from $v/c=-0.074$ to $v/c=-0.40$. Here we present the simultaneous XMM-Newton RGS (Reflection Grating Spectrometer) spectrum, where three lower ionization counterparts of the Fe K velocity zones are observed; at $v/c=-0.074, -0.12$ and $-0.33$. The soft X-ray absorbers tend to be somewhat less ionized than their Fe K counterparts, with their opacity mainly arising from Fe L shell lines and highly ionized Oxygen. From comparing the Resolve and RGS absorbers, we show that the outflow can be parameterized with a density profile varying with radius as $r^{-5/3}$, while the lower ionization zones likely originate from denser clumps of gas. Pure electron scattering appears insufficient to provide enough thrust to power the wind, unless sufficient low ionization gas capable of radiative line driving exists outside of the line of sight. Overall, PG 1211+143 provides further evidence for the clumpy nature of accretion disk winds, as was recently revealed in the quasar PDS 456 with XRISM.</description>

Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs), the evolutionary endpoints of most stars, can form through both single-star and binary channels. While single-star evolutionary models enable reliable WD age estimates, binary evolution introduces interactions that can accelerate WD formation and result in a variety of exotic WDs, which may exhibit strong magnetic fields, rapid rotation, or even serve as potential gravitational wave sources. Such systems offer valuable insights into magnetic field generation, angular momentum evolution, and compact object physics. Star clusters, with their approximately coeval populations, allow precise age determination of member WDs. If a WD's total age derived from single-star evolution exceeds that of its host cluster, it likely indicates a binary origin. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia} 5D astrometry to identify 439 WD candidates in 117 open clusters, with 244 likely formed via binary evolution. We discuss the possibility of dynamical ejection for WDs meeting only 2D (proper motion space) membership criteria. Spectroscopic observations further reveal a subset with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation, supporting their binary evolutionary origin.</description>

Abstract: The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda&gt;1500$ {\AA} continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.</description>

      <title>Dust destruction by the supernova remnant forward shock in a turbulent interstellar medium</title>

Abstract: Context. While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of the Pleiades: anisotropy of turbulence in the cold neutral medium</title>

Abstract: Interstellar medium studies rely on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence as a framework for interpretation. In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic.</description>

      <title>Can GW231123 have a stellar origin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+23}_{-18} M_\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50} M_\odot$ -- in the range of the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160\,M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90\% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We allow for differential rotation to explore the high-spin regime. In this limit of weak angular momentum transport, we find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing an important correlation between masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.</description>

      <title>A novel algorithm for GPU-accelerated particle-mesh interactions implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, GPU-optimized algorithm for particle-mesh interactions in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, designed for massively parallel architectures. This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour searches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new "particle-mesh-particle" interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh method for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first, quantities exchanged between particles and the mesh -- such as mass, energy, and momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink -- are deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple contributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then communicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer states are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to enforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme in the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA and validate it through a comprehensive suite of tests, including Bondi and Bondi-Hoyle accretion, and single and multiple supernova remnant evolution at varying spatial resolutions. We show that the algorithm achieves $\approx 50\%$ weak-scaling efficiency running on up to 8192 GPUs on the Frontier supercomputer. This scheme enables efficient, scalable particle-mesh coupling for GPU-optimized simulations of star formation and feedback in galaxies.</description>

      <title>JOYS: JWST MIRI/MRS spectra of the inner 500 au region of the L1527 IRS bipolar outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study characterized the physical and kinematic properties within the innermost 500 au region of the L1527 bipolar outflow, a class 0/I low-mass protostar using JWST MIRI/MRS spectroscopy across 5-28 micron at 0.2-1.0 arcsec resolution. We identified emission lines from molecular and ionized species and analyzed their spatial morphology using line-integrated intensity maps. We derived gas temperatures and column densities through excitation diagram analysis of H2 rotational lines and compared results with shock models. The observations reveal extended molecular hydrogen emission tracing the bipolar outflow, with the H2 gas temperatures distributed into warm (~550 K) and hot (~2500 K) components, likely originating from moderate-velocity J-type shocks and some UV irradiation. We detect forbidden atomic and ionized emission lines of [Ni ii], [Ar ii], [Ne ii], [Ne iii], [S i], and [Fe ii] showing spatially extended morphology. Double-peaked emission profiles were seen in [Ar ii], [Ne iii], and [Fe ii], in the eastern region, suggesting that the high velocity component traces a fast, highly ionized jet. A radial velocity map derived from [Ne ii] emission shows the eastern region to be redshifted and the western region blueshifted, contrary to earlier interpretations. The analysis of the MIRI/MRS observations reveals molecular, atomic, and ionized emission lines in this low-mass protostar connected with active outflow signatures. The most striking feature discovered is the presence of a poorly collimated high-velocity ionized jet, embedded within a broader wide-angle molecular outflow likely driven by a disk wind. The coexistence of these components supports a stratified outflow structure and suggests that L1527 exhibits unique jet-launching characteristics atypical of its early evolutionary stage.</description>
