      <title>Resolving features and derivatives in data with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A frequently occurring challenge in experimental and numerical observation is how to resolve features, such as spectral peaks - with center, width, height - and derivatives from measured data with unavoidable noise. Therefore, we develop a modified Whittaker-Henderson smoothing procedure that balances the spectral features and the noise. In our procedure, we introduce adjustable weights that are optimized using cross-validation. When the measurement errors are known, a straightforward error analysis of the smoothed results is feasible. As an example, we calculate the optical group delay dispersion of a Bragg reflector from synthetic phase data with noise to illustrate the effectiveness of the smoothing algorithm. The smoother faithfully reconstructs the group delay dispersion, allowing to observe details that otherwise remain buried in noise. To further illustrate the power of our smoother, we study several commonly occurring difficulties in data and data analysis and show how to properly smoothen unequally sampled data, how to obtain discontinuities, including discontinuous derivatives or kinks, and how to properly smooth data in the vicinity of boundaries to the domains.</description>

      <title>Foundation models for high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of foundation models -- large, pretrained machine learning models that can be finetuned to a variety of tasks -- has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. In high-energy physics, the question of whether these models can be implemented directly in physics research, or even built from scratch, tailored for particle physics data, has generated an increasing amount of attention. This review, which is the first on the topic of foundation models in high-energy physics, summarizes and discusses the research that has been published in the field so far.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Transfer Operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Signal Models Defined by the High-Dimensional, Small-Sample Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a signal variable from multiple variables that contain many noise variables is often approached as a variable selection problem under a given objective variable. This is nothing more than building a supervised model of a signal by specifying the signal as the objective variable. On the other hand, such a supervised model does not work effectively under high-dimensional and small-sample-size conditions, as the estimation of model parameters becomes indeterminate. We propose an ``intrinsic signal model'' that enables signal detection under high-dimensional and small-sample-size conditions without external signal definitions. The proposed intrinsic signal model is based on the assumption that the datasets in this world are generated from a certain dynamical system, and variables generated from dynamical systems with small correlation lengths are considered noisy variables. That is, the variables that maintain the data structure generated from a dynamical system under high-dimensional and small-sample-size conditions, corresponding to the limit of a sample size of 0, are modeled as always signal variables. In this study, we showed that with such a signal model, the Taguchi method provides an effective way of detecting signals. The proposed signal model was validated by generating a dataset with a globally coupled map system, which is a high-dimensional dynamical system. Furthermore, we validated the model with Gene Expression Data which are not explicitly generated from a dynamical system; as a result, we observed a signal structure consistent with that of the signal model proposed in this study. The results suggest that the proposed signal model is valid for a wide range of datasets.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Sustainable Remanufacturing, Reusing and Recycling for Lithium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sustainable utilization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial to the global energy transition and carbon neutrality, yet data scarcity and heterogeneity remain major barriers across remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This dissertation develops a machine learning assisted framework to address these challenges throughout the battery lifecycle. A physics informed quality control model predicts long-term degradation from limited early-cycle data, while a generative learning based residual value assessment method enables rapid and accurate evaluation of retired batteries under random conditions. A federated learning strategy achieves privacy preserving and high precision cathode material sorting, supporting efficient recycling. Furthermore, a unified diagnostics and prognostics framework based on correlation alignment enhances adaptability across tasks such as state of health estimation, state of charge estimation, and remaining useful life prediction under varied testing protocols. Collectively, these contributions advance sustainable battery management by integrating physics, data generation, privacy preserving collaboration, and adaptive learning, offering methodological innovations to promote circular economy and global carbon neutrality.</description>
