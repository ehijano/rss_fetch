      <title>A new XML conversion process for mensural music encoding : CMME\_to\_MEI (via Verovio)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ricercar Lab - the musicological research team at the Center for advanced Studies in the Renaissance at the University of Tours - has decided to make available in open access, thanks to the support of the French digital infrastructure Biblissima, a large corpus of about 3500 XML files of 15th-c. music. This corpus was produced by the German musicologist Clemens Goldberg who encoded since 2010 onwards the musical content of 34 major 15th-c. music manuscripts and other complementary files, in order to offer on his foundation's website PDF files of complete collections of works by Du Fay, Binchois, Okeghem, Busnoys and most of their major contemporaries, focusing on their secular output. This corpus was encoded in an XML format named CMME (Computerized Mensural Music Editing), specifically conceived for mensural music by Theodor Dumitrescu in the 2000s, together with editorial and publication tools which have not been updated since then. This article focuses on the development of a set of conversion tools for these CMME files to meet more up-to-date standards of music encoding, namely MEI. A workshop was organised in September 2024 at the Campus Condorcet in Paris, gathering experts with a wide range of knowledge on mensural music notation, XML formats and programming. A converter was developped directly in the open-source rendering library Verovio, allowing the conversion from CMME to MEI mensural. A conversion to MEI CMN was implemented afterwards, enabling to load these files in common engraving softwares such as MuseScore with minimal loss of information. With the availability of a direct import of CMME-XML into Verovio, the corpus of existing CMME files gets a new life. Furthermore, since the stand-alone CMME editor still works fine and no alternative is available yet for native MEI, the converter offers a new pipeline for encoding and editing mensural music.</description>

      <title>Buckaroo: A Direct Manipulation Visual Data Wrangler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing datasets -- a critical phase known as data wrangling -- constitutes the dominant phase of data science development, consuming upwards of 80% of the total project time. This phase encompasses a myriad of tasks: parsing data, restructuring it for analysis, repairing inaccuracies, merging sources, eliminating duplicates, and ensuring overall data integrity. Traditional approaches, typically through manual coding in languages such as Python or using spreadsheets, are not only laborious but also error-prone. These issues range from missing entries and formatting inconsistencies to data type inaccuracies, all of which can affect the quality of downstream tasks if not properly corrected. To address these challenges, we present Buckaroo, a visualization system to highlight discrepancies in data and enable on-the-spot corrections through direct manipulations of visual objects. Buckaroo (1) automatically finds "interesting" data groups that exhibit anomalies compared to the rest of the groups and recommends them for inspection; (2) suggests wrangling actions that the user can choose to repair the anomalies; and (3) allows users to visually manipulate their data by displaying the effects of their wrangling actions and offering the ability to undo or redo these actions, which supports the iterative nature of data wrangling.

      <title>Querying Graph-Relational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For applications that store structured data in relational databases, there is an impedance mismatch between the flat representations encouraged by relational data models and the deeply nested information that applications expect to receive. In this work, we present the graph-relational database model, which provides a flexible, compositional, and strongly-typed solution to this "object-relational mismatch." We formally define the graph-relational database model and present a static and dynamic semantics for queries. In addition, we discuss the realization of the graph-relational database model in EdgeQL, a general-purpose SQL-style query language, and the Gel system, which compiles EdgeQL schemas and queries into PostgreSQL queries. Gel facilitates the kind of object-shaped data manipulation that is frequently provided inefficiently by object-relational mapping (ORM) technologies, while achieving most of the efficiency that comes from require writing complex PostgreSQL queries directly.</description>

      <title>R-Bot: An LLM-based Query Rewrite System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query rewrite is essential for optimizing SQL queries to improve their execution efficiency without changing their results. Traditionally, this task has been tackled through heuristic and learning-based methods, each with its limitations in terms of inferior quality and low robustness. Recent advancements in LLMs offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities. Despite their potential, directly applying LLMs like GPT-4 has faced challenges due to problems such as hallucinations, where the model might generate inaccurate or irrelevant results. To address this, we propose R-Bot, an LLM-based query rewrite system with a systematic approach. We first design a multi-source rewrite evidence preparation pipeline to generate query rewrite evidences for guiding LLMs to avoid hallucinations. We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a step-by-step LLM rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets and widely used benchmarks, and demonstrate the superior performance of our system, R-Bot, surpassing state-of-the-art query rewrite methods. The R-Bot system has been deployed at Huawei and with real customers, and the results show that the proposed R-Bot system achieves lower query latency.</description>

      <title>A Review of Privacy Metrics for Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy Preserving Synthetic Data Generation (PP-SDG) has emerged to produce synthetic datasets from personal data while maintaining privacy and utility. Differential privacy (DP) is the property of a PP-SDG mechanism that establishes how protected individuals are when sharing their sensitive data. It is however difficult to interpret the privacy budget ($\varepsilon$) expressed by DP. To make the actual risk associated with the privacy budget more transparent, multiple privacy metrics (PMs) have been proposed to assess the privacy risk of the data. These PMs are utilized in separate studies to assess newly introduced PP-SDG mechanisms. Consequently, these PMs embody the same assumptions as the PP-SDG mechanism they were made to assess. Therefore, a thorough definition of how these are calculated is necessary. In this work, we present the assumptions and mathematical formulations of 17 distinct privacy metrics.</description>
