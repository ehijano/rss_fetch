      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros of 2D Nearest-Neighbor Antiferromagnetic Ising Models: A Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.</description>

      <title>Universal Exotic Dynamics in Critical Mesoscopic Systems: Simulating the Square Root of Avogadro's Number of Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly demonstrate the universality of critical dynamics through unprecedented large-scale GPU-based simulations of two out-of-equilibrium processes, comparing the behavior of spin-$1/2$ Ising and spin-$1$ Blume-Capel models on a square lattice. In the first protocol, a completely disordered system is instantaneously brought into contact with a thermal bath at the critical temperature, allowing it to evolve until the coherence length exceeds $10^{3}$ lattice spacings. Finite-size effects are negligible due to the mesoscopic scale of the lattice sizes studied, with linear dimensions up to $L=2^{22}$ and $2^{19}$ for the Ising and Blume-Capel models, respectively. Our numerical data, and the subsequent analysis, demonstrate a strong dynamic universality between the two models and provide the most precise estimate to date of the dynamic critical exponent for this universality class, $z = 2.1676(1)$. In the second protocol, we corroborate the role of the universal ratio of dynamic and static length scales in achieving an exponential acceleration in the approach to equilibrium just \emph{above} the critical temperature, through a time-dependent variation of the thermal bath temperature. The results presented in this work leverage our CUDA-based numerical code, breaking the world record for the simulation speed of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Effect of substitution La by Mg on electrochemical and electronic properties in La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys: a combined experimental and ab initio studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: La-Mg-Ni-based alloys are promising negative electrode materials for 3rd generation of Ni-MH$_x$ batteries. In this work, we investigate the effect of Mg substitution on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ materials. The mechanical alloying technique is used to produce a series of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys ($x$ = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). The X-ray diffraction measurements indicate multiphase character of the samples with majority (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phases of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type. Electrochemical measurements show how the maximum discharge capacity ($C_{max}$) increases with Mg concentration and that reach the highest value of 304 mAh/g for La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.5). The experimental efforts are followed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with the full-potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO). To simulate chemical disorder, we use the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The calculations are focused on the La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ composition with the highest measured value of $C_{max}$. Additionally, several other structures are considered as reference points. We find that hexagonal and rhombohedral structures of La$_2$Ni$_7$ have almost identical total energies, which is in a good agreement with a coexistence of both phases in the samples. The calculated site preferences of Mg in both Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phases are consistent with the previous experimental data. Furthermore, the valence band of the nanocrystalline La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ sample is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental XPS are interpreted based on the corresponding spectra calculated with DFT.</description>

      <title>Effect of Gd and Co content on electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloys: a combined experimental and first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of Gd and Co substitutions on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloy. Two series of La$_{1.5-x}$Gd$_x$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.0, 0.25, 1.0) and La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_{7-y}$Co$_y$ ($y$ = 0.0, 0.5, 1.5) alloys are produced using mechanical alloying technique. The X-ray diffraction indicates multiphase character of the samples, with the majority of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type structures of (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phase. Partial substitutions of La by Gd or Ni by Co in La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phase result in increase of cycle stability of the metal hydride (MH$_x$) electrodes. All considered alloys reach the maximum discharge capacity after three charging-discharging cycles. Two optimal compositions, in respect of electrochemical properties, are subsequently investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental analysis of the valence band is further extended by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We also discuss the effects of alloying and site preference of dopants on the position of the van Hove-type singularity, as observed in the electronic densities of states (DOS) in proximity of the Fermi level.</description>

Abstract: High-pressure induced structural transition from zircon-type phase into scheelite-type phase in YVO$_4$ is studied using ab initio calculations. Several structures with compressed volumes are evaluated, where for every considered volume the c/a ratio and atomic positions are optimised. The transition pressure and transition volume change are calculated. The reports on YVO$_4$ electronic structure and electronic band gap behaviour are followed by results of X-Ray photoemission spectra XPS calculations. Most of our theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results taken from literature.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM): Predicting Phase Transitions Across Temperature, Pressure, and Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and characterizing phase transitions is crucial for understanding generic physical phenomena such as crystallization, protein folding and others. However, directly observing phase transitions is not always easy, and often one has limited observations far from the phase boundary and measured under some specific thermodynamic conditions. In this study, we propose a statistical physics and Generative AI driven framework that can take such limited information to generate samples of different phases under arbitrary thermodynamic conditions, which we name Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM). The central idea is to map collected data into a tractable simple prior expressed as an exponentially tilted Gaussian. We demonstrate how the variance and mean of the prior can be correlated with pairs of thermodynamic control variables, including temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. This gives us the ability to generate thermodynamically correct samples under any values of the control variables. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we use expTM to sample the lattice gas models with the Grand Canonical ensemble, capturing phase transitions under varying chemical potentials and temperatures. We further demonstrate how expTM can model the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, with which we predict different phases of CO2 under varying pressure conditions. Both examples are trained on very limited data far from the phase boundary. These results establish expTM as a robust tool for understanding phase transitions across diverse thermodynamic conditions requiring only a small number of observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the analytic adjoint solution for two-dimensional (2D) incompressible potential flow for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force using the connection of the adjoint approach to Green's functions and also by establishing and exploiting its relation to the adjoint incompressible Euler equations. By comparison with the analytic solution, it is shown that the naive approach based on solving Laplace's equation for the adjoint variables can be ill-defined. The analysis of the boundary behavior of the analytic solution is used to discuss the proper formulation of the adjoint problem as well as the mechanism for incorporating the Kutta condition in the adjoint formulation</description>

      <title>Machine learning surrogate models of many-body dispersion interactions in polymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions is essential for understanding the van der Waals forces that govern the behavior of many complex molecular systems. However, the high computational cost of MBD calculations limits their direct application in large-scale simulations. In this work, we introduce a machine learning surrogate model specifically designed to predict MBD forces in polymer melts, a system that demands accurate MBD description and offers structural advantages for machine learning approaches. Our model is based on a trimmed SchNet architecture that selectively retains the most relevant atomic connections and incorporates trainable radial basis functions for geometric encoding. We validate our surrogate model on datasets from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride melts, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robust generalization across diverse polymer systems. In addition, the model captures key physical features, such as the characteristic decay behavior of MBD interactions, providing valuable insights for optimizing cutoff strategies. Characterized by high computational efficiency, our surrogate model enables practical incorporation of MBD effects into large-scale molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Enskog-Vlasov finite-difference Lattice Boltzmann (EV-FDLB) for liquid-vapor systems with variable temperature is introduced. The model involves both the simplified Enskog collision operator and the self-consistent force field which accounts for the long-range interaction between the fluid particles. Full-range Gauss-Hermite quadratures were used for the discretization of the momentum space. The numerical solutions of the Enskog-Vlasov equation obtained employing the EV-FDLB model and the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)-like particle method (PM) are compared. Reasonable agreement is found between the two approaches when simulating the liquid-vapor phase separation and the liquid slab evaporation.</description>

      <title>Symplectic integration of guiding-center equations in canonical coordinates for general toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators with long-term preservation of integrals of motion are introduced for the guiding-center model of plasma particles in toroidal magnetic fields of general topology. An efficient transformation to canonical coordinates from cylindrical and flux-like coordinates is discussed and applied using one component of the magnetic vector potential as a spatial coordinate. This choice is efficient in both, theoretical and numerical developments and marks a generalization of magnetic flux coordinates. The transformation enables the application of conventional symplectic integration schemes formulated in canonical coordinates, as well as variational integrators on the guiding-center system, without requiring magnetic flux coordinates. Symplectic properties and superior efficiency of the implicit midpoint scheme compared to conventional non-symplectic methods are demonstrated on perturbed tokamak fields with magnetic islands and stochastic regions. The presented results mark a crucial step towards gyrokinetic models that conserve physical invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized the study of crystalline materials for enabling rapid predictions and discovery. However, most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects and dopants break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Addressing these challenges requires models that are able to capture sparse defect-driven effects in crystals while maintaining adaptability and precision. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. Trained on 14,866 defect structures, DefiNet achieves highly accurate structural predictions in a single step, avoiding the time-consuming iterative processes in modern ML relaxation models and possible error accumulation from iteration. We further validates DefiNet's accuracy by using density functional theory (DFT) relaxation on DefiNet-predicted structures. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a groundbreaking tool for defect-focused materials research.</description>

      <title>pyTTN: An Open Source Toolbox for Open and Closed System Quantum Dynamics Simulations Using Tree Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans\"atze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.</description>

      <title>An efficient particle locating method on unstructured meshes in two and three dimensions based on patch searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a particle locating method for unstructured meshes in two and three dimensions. Our algorithm is based on a patch searching process, and includes two steps. We first locate the given point to a patch near a vertex, and then the host element is determined within the patch domain. Here, the patch near a vertex is the domain of elements around this vertex. We prove that in the first step the patch can be rapidly identified by constructing an auxiliary Cartesian grid with a prescribed resolution. Then, the second step can be converted into a searching problem, which can be easily solved by searching algorithms. Only coordinates to particles are required in our method. We conduct a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to illustrate the robustness and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15771</link>

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a challenging problem that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</description>

      <title>A Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>

      <title>An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</description>
