      <title>Self-Organized Pattern Formation in Geological Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological materials are often seen as the antithesis of soft; rocks are hard. However, during the formation of minerals and rocks, all the systems we shall discuss, indeed geological materials in general, pass through a stage where they are soft. This occurs either because they are at a high temperature -- igneous or metamorphic rock -- or because they are at a lower temperature but in the presence of water -- sedimentary rock. For this reason it is useful to introduce soft-matter concepts into the geological domain. There is a universality in the diverse instances of geological patterns that may be appreciated by looking at the common aspect in their formation of having passed through a stage as soft matter.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Computation of Classical Horizontal Geodetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines mathematical models for processing classical horizontal geodetic (triangulation and trilateration) networks. Two rigorous parametric adjustment models are discussed. The first one is a well-known model of adjustment in the geodetic coordinate system. This model is completely rigorous (functional and stochastic parts) and uses unreduced distance and direction observations. The proposed alternative is a model of planar network adjustment with observations rigorously reduced directly to the mapping plane. These ground-to-grid reductions are simple and universal, regardless of which map projection is used. Slightly different results of the planar network adjustment are obtained. The differences are attributed to a non-rigorous stochastic model. In theory, the stochastic properties of the reduced observations should also be adapted. However, these differences are very small and can always be neglected in geodetic and surveying practice.</description>

      <title>A Root-Zone Soil Salinity Observatory for Coastal Southwest Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research assesses soil salinity in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh, collecting a total of 162 topsoil samples between March 1 and March 9, 2024, and processing them following the standard operating procedure for soil electrical conductivity (soil/water, 1:5). Electrical conductivity (EC) measurements obtained using a HI-6321 advanced conductivity benchtop meter were analyzed and visualized using bubble density mapping and the Empirical Bayesian Kriging interpolation method. The findings indicate that soil salinity in the study area ranges from 0.05 to 9.09 mS/cm, with the highest levels observed near Debhata and Koyra. A gradient of increasing soil salinity is clearly evident from the northern to southern regions. This dataset provides a critical resource for soil salinity-related research in the region, offering valuable insights to support decision-makers in understanding and mitigating the impacts of soil salinity in Bangladesh's coastal areas.</description>

      <title>Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning for Deep Learning-Based Full-Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) has seen promising advancements through deep learning. Existing approaches typically focus on task-specific models trained and evaluated in isolation that lead to limited generalization across different geological scenarios. In this work we introduce a task-agnostic foundational model for FWI that captures general features across tasks. We first demonstrate that full fine-tuning of this foundational model outperforms task-specific models built from scratch by delivering superior performance across multiple benchmarks. Building upon this we employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to further reduce computational overhead. By fine-tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters PEFT achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning while significantly lowering memory and computational requirements. Additionally, PEFT excels in out-of-distribution tasks where it outperforms both full fine-tuning and task-specific models. These findings establish the value of foundational modeling for FWI and highlight PEFT as an effective strategy for efficient and scalable adaptation across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Modeling Global Surface Dust Deposition Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paleoclimatic measurements serve to understand Earth System processes and evaluate climate model performances. However, their spatial coverage is generally sparse and unevenly distributed across the globe. Statistical interpolation methods are the prevalent techniques to grid such data, but these purely data-driven approaches sometimes produce results that are incoherent with our knowledge of the physical world. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) follow an innovative approach to data analysis and physical modeling through machine learning, as they incorporate physical principles into the data-driven learning process. Here, we develop PINNs to reconstruct global maps of atmospheric dust surface deposition fluxes from measurement data in paleoclimatic archives for the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum periods. We design an advection-diffusion equation to consider dominant wind directions at various latitudes, which prevents dust particles from flowing upwind. Our PINN improves on standard kriging interpolation by allowing variable asymmetry around data points. The reconstructions display realistic dust plumes from continental sources towards ocean basins following prevailing winds.</description>

Abstract: Recently, large models, or foundation models, have exhibited remarkable performance, profoundly impacting research paradigms in diverse domains. Foundation models, trained on extensive and diverse datasets, provide exceptional generalization abilities, allowing for their straightforward application across various use cases and domains. Exploration geophysics is the study of the Earth's subsurface to find natural resources and help with environmental and engineering projects. It uses methods like analyzing seismic, magnetic, and electromagnetic data, which presents unique challenges and opportunities for the development of geophysical foundation models (GeoFMs). This perspective explores the potential applications and future research directions of GeoFMs in exploration geophysics. We also review the development of foundation models, including large language models, large vision models, and large multimodal models, as well as their advancement in the field of geophysics. Furthermore, we discuss the hierarchy of GeoFMs for exploration geophysics and the critical techniques employed, providing a foundational research workflow for their development. Lastly, we summarize the challenges faced in developing GeoFMs, along with future trends and their potential impact on the field. In conclusion, this perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the development, hierarchy, applications, development workflow, and challenges of foundation models, highlighting their transformative potential in advancing exploration geophysics.</description>
