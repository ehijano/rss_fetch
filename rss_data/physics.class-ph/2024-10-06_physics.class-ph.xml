      <title>A mathematical model for Nordic skiing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nordic skiing provides fascinating opportunities for mathematical modelling studies that exploit methods and insights from physics, applied mathematics, data analysis, scientific computing and sports science. A typical ski course winds over varied terrain with frequent changes in elevation and direction, and so its geometry is naturally described by a three-dimensional space curve. The skier travels along a course under the influence of various forces, and their dynamics can be described using a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are derived from Newton's laws of motion. We develop an algorithm for solving the governing equations that combines Hermite spline interpolation, numerical quadrature and a high-order ODE solver. Numerical simulations are compared with measurements of skiers on actual courses to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength topological interface modes in a multilayered vibroacoustic metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic and rigorous analytical approach, based on the transfer matrix methodology, to study the existence, evolution, and robustness of subwavelength topological interface states in practical multilayered vibroacoustic phononic lattices. These lattices, composed of membrane-air cavity unit cells, exhibit complex band structures with various bandgaps, including Bragg, band-splitting induced, local resonance, and plasma bandgaps. Focusing on the challenging low-frequency range and assuming axisymmetric modes, we show that topological interface states are confined to Bragg-like band-splitting induced bandgaps. Unlike the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the vibroacoustic lattice exhibits diverse topological phase transitions across infinite bands, enabling broadband, multi-frequency vibroacoustics in the subwavelength regime. We establish three criteria for the existence of these states: the Zak phase, surface impedance, and a new reflection coefficient concept, all derived from transfer matrix components. Notably, we provide an explicit expression for the exact location of topological interface states within the band structure, offering insight for their predictive implementation. We confirm the robustness of these states against structural variations and identify delocalization as bandgaps narrow. Our work provides a complete and exact analytical characterization of topological interface states, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transfer matrix method. Beyond its analytical depth, our approach provides a useful framework and design tool for topological phononic lattices, advancing applications such as efficient sound filters, waveguides, noise control, and acoustic sensors in the subwavelength regime. Its versatility extends beyond the vibroacoustic systems, encompassing a broader range of phononic and photonic crystals with repetitive inversion-symmetric unit cells.</description>

      <title>The Haar measure in solid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the overlooked but crucial role of the Haar measure in solid mechanics, a concept well-established in mathematical literature but frequently misunderstood by mechanicians. The aim is to provide practical insights and methodologies for the application of the Haar measure in various mechanical scenarios. The article begins with an introduction to the Haar measure, underlying its significance and a theoretical foundation for its definition and formulas. Moving beyond mathematical abstraction, the core of the article relies on practical applications, including the computation of the Haar measure for the orthogonal transformations of the 2D and 3D space under several commonly used parametrisations, an application about invariant theory in mechanics and sampling on a group orbit. These applications are presented with practical examples, enabling mechanicians to integrate the Haar measure into their research seamlessly. The article caters to a broad audience, with sections designed for both introductory comprehension and in-depth exploration. Our goal is to equip mechanicians with a valuable tool, bridging the gap between mathematical theory and practical applications in the field of mechanics.</description>
