      <title>Symmetry groups of flat fully augmented links and their complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the (orientation-preserving) symmetry groups of $b$-prime flat fully augmented links correspond exactly with the finite subgroups of $O(3)$. We accomplish this by first developing a dictionary between automorphisms of a $3$-connected planar cubic graph associated to a flat fully augmented link $L$ and orientation-preserving symmetries of $L$. Our work also provides a simple method to explicitly construct infinite classes of distinct $b$-prime flat fully augmented links $\{L_i\}$ with $Sym^{+}(\mathbb{S}^{3} \setminus L_i) \cong Sym^{+}(\mathbb{S}^{3}, L_i) \cong G$, for any $G$ that is a finite subgroup of $O(3)$.</description>

      <title>Maximal Volume Ideal Polyhedra and the Arithmetic Angle Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a software suite for the analysis and optimization of ideal convex polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$. Using Rivin's variational characterization of ideal polyhedra, we develop efficient algorithms for checking combinatorial realizability and finding volume-maximizing configurations. Our systematic computational study reveals two striking phenomena: (1) maximal volume ideal polyhedra consistently exhibit dihedral angles that are rational multiples of $\pi$ -- a property with no obvious explanation from the optimization formulation; and (2) the distribution of volumes for random configurations is well-approximated by a Beta distribution, with mean normalized volume converging to approximately $\ln 2 \approx 0.69$ as the vertex count increases. We provide complete data for small vertex counts, including vertex positions, triangulations, and verified rational angle structures. An interactive implementation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Universal circles for Anosov foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thurston introduced the notion of a universal circle associated to a taut foliation of a $3$-manifold as a way of organizing the ideal circle boundaries of its leaves into a single circle action. Calegari--Dunfield proved that every taut foliation of an atoroidal $3$-manifold $M$ has a universal circle, but the uniqueness (or lack-thereof) of this structure remains rather mysterious.
  In this paper, we consider the foliations associated to an Anosov flow $\varphi$ on $M$, showing that several constructions of a universal circle in the literature are typically distinct. Moreover, the underlying action of the Calegari--Dunfield leftmost universal circle is generally not even conjugate to the universal circle arising from the boundary of the flow space of $\varphi$. Our primary tool is a way to use the flow space of $\varphi$ to parameterize the circle bundle at infinity of $\varphi$'s invariant foliations.</description>

      <title>The bicorn curves on closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on using the theory of bicorn curves in the context of closed surfaces to understand hyperbolic phenomena of the curve graphs of those surfaces. We prove that the curve graph of any closed surface is 15-hyperbolic with one exception. Furthermore, we provide significantly tighter bounds for the bounded geodesic image theorem, originally proven by Masur--Minsky.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for cusp-less planar hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a tree bijection has been found for planar hyperbolic surfaces, which allows for an easy computation of the Weil--Petersson volumes, and opens the path to get distance statistic on random hyperbolic surfaces and to find scaling limits when the number of boundaries becomes large. Crucially, this tree bijection requires the hyperbolic surface to have at least one cusp as origin, from which point distances are measured. In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Modularity for Geometric 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum modularity conjecture, first introduced by Don Zagier, is a general statement about a relation between $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariants of links and 3-manifolds at roots of unity related by a modular transformation. In this note we formulate a strong version of the conjecture for Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants of closed geometric, not necessarily hyperbolic, 3-manifolds. This version in particular involves a geometrically distinguished $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ flat connection (a generalization of the standard hyperbolic flat connection to other Thurston geometries) and has a statement about the integrality of coefficients appearing in the modular transformation formula. We prove that the conjecture holds for Brieskorn homology spheres and some other examples. We also comment on how the conjecture relates to a formal realization of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariant at a general root of unity as a path integral in analytically continued $SU(2)$ Chern--Simons theory with a rational level.</description>

      <title>An equivalent condition for q-holonomicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a sequence is q-holonomic if and only if it satisfies the elimination property for any subset of variables. The same result also holds for holonomic sequences. As an application, we prove several conjectured closure properties for q-holonomic sequences. We also prove that Jones-style sequences for links in any closed $3$-manifold are q-holonomic, which in turn implies that the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are q-holonomic in the colors.</description>

      <title>The effective Chen ranks conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koszul modules and their associated resonance schemes are objects appearing in a variety of contexts in algebraic geometry, topology, and combinatorics. We present a proof of an effective version of the Chen ranks conjecture describing the Hilbert function of any Koszul module verifying natural conditions inspired by geometry. We give applications to hyperplane arrangements, describing in a uniform effective manner the Chen ranks of the fundamental group of the complement of every arrangement whose projective resonance is reduced. Finally, we formulate a sharp generic vanishing conjecture for Koszul modules and present a parallel between this statement and the Prym--Green Conjecture on syzygies of general Prym canonical curves.</description>

      <title>Uniform Lefschetz fixed-point theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the Lefschetz fixed-point theory for noncompact manifolds of bounded geometry and uniformly continuous maps. Specifically, we define the uniform Lefschetz class $\mathscr{L}(f)$ of a uniformly continuous map $f\colon M\to M$ of a uniform simply-connected noncompact complete Riemannian manifold of bounded geometry $M$ satisfying $d(f,1)&lt;\infty$, and prove that $\mathscr{L}(f)=0$ if and only if $f$ is uniformly homotopic to a strongly fixed-point free (without fixed-points on $M$ and at infinity) uniformly continuous map. To achieve this, we introduce a new cohomology for metric spaces, called uniform bounded cohomology, which is a variant of bounded cohomology, and develop an obstruction theory formulated in terms of this cohomology.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic systole of Seifert surfaces and distortion of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1983, Gromov introduced the notion of distortion of a knot, and asked if there are knots with arbitrarily large distortion. In 2011, Pardon proved that the distortion of $T_{p,q}$ is at least $\min\{p,q\}$ up to a constant factor. We prove that the distortion of $T_{p, p+1}\# K$ is at least $p$ up to a constant, independent of $K$. We also prove that any embedding of a minimal genus Seifert surface for $T_{p,p+1}\# K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has small extrinsic systole, in the sense that it contains a non-contractible loop with small $\mathbb{R}^3$-diameter relative to the length of the knot. These results are related to combinatorial properties of the monodromy map associated to torus knots.</description>

      <title>The BPS decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the BPS decomposition theorem (a.k.a. cohomological integrality theorem) decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks into the Weyl-invariant part of the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of good moduli spaces. As a consequence, we establish the BPS decomposition theorem for the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks and for the critical cohomology of symmetric $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks, thereby generalizing the main result of Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--Kinjo--P\u{a}durariu to the non-orthogonal setting.
  We will present three applications of our main result. First, we confirm Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces, extending Davison's work on the moduli stack of objects in $2$-Calabi--Yau categories. Second, we prove versions of Kirwan surjectivity for the critical cohomology of symmetric $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks and for the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks. Finally, by applying our main result to the character stacks associated with compact oriented $3$-manifolds, we reduce the quantum geometric Langlands duality conjecture for $3$-manifolds, as formulated by Safronov, from an isomorphism between infinite-dimensional critical cohomologies to a comparison of finite-dimensional BPS cohomologies.</description>
