      <title>Anatomy of finite-volume effect on hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy spectrum relevant to the lattice calculation of hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment a_\mu is dominantly given by two-pion states satisfying L\"uscher's finite-volume quantization condition. Finite-volume effects from those states may exhibit power-law dependence on the volume, contrary to an exponential suppression as suggested by chiral effective theory. Employing the finite-volume state decomposition of Euclidean correlators, we systematically investigate the volume dependence. Phenomenological inputs are used for \pi\pi phase shift and time-like pion form factor. Our estimate for the finite-volume effects on a_\mu is larger than previous works and has a different volume scaling. Numerical results are given for the ``window'' observables of a_\mu.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the confinement string in (2 + 1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact lattice Quantum Electrodynamics is a complex quantum field theory with dynamical gauge and matter fields and it has similarities with Quantum Chromodynamics, in particular asymptotic freedom and confinement. We consider a (2+1)-dimensional lattice discretization of Quantum Electrodynamics with the inclusion of dynamical fermionic matter. We define a suitable quantum algorithm to measure the static potential as a function of the distance between two charges on the lattice and we use a variational quantum calculation to explore the Coulomb, confinement and string breaking regimes. A symmetry-preserving and resource-efficient variational quantum circuit is employed to prepare the ground state of the theory at various values of the coupling constant, corresponding to different physical distances, allowing the accurate extraction of the static potential from a quantum computer. We demonstrate that results from quantum experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion device and emulator, with full connectivity between qubits, agree with classical noiseless simulations using circuits with 10 and 24 qubits. Moreover, we visualize the electric field flux configurations that mostly contribute in the wave-function of the quantum ground state in the different regimes of the potential, thus giving insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking. These results are a promising step forward in the grand challenge of solving higher dimensional lattice gauge theory problems with quantum computing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Biquaternion Signal Processing for Nonlinear Ultrasonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization and classification of scattered nonlinear ultrasonic signatures in 2 dimensional complex damaged media using Time Reversal based Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy (TR-NEWS) approach is extended to 3 dimensional complex damaged media. In (2+1)D, i.e. space 2 dimensional time 1 dimensional spacetime, we used quaternion bases for analyses, while in (3+1)D, we use biquaternion bases.
  The optimal weight function of the path of ultrasonic wave in (3+1)D lattice is obtained by using the Echo State Network (ESN) which is a Machine Learning technique. The hysteresis effect is incorporated by using the Preisach-Mayergoyz model.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum computing Feynman diagrams in hybrid qubit-oscillator devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that recent experiments in hybrid qubit-oscillator devices that measure the phase-space characteristic function of the oscillator via the qubit can be seen through the lens of functional calculus and path integrals, drawing a clear analogy with the generating functional of a quantum field theory. This connection suggests an expansion of the characteristic function in terms of Feynman diagrams, exposing the role of the real-time bosonic propagator, and identifying the external source functions with certain time-dependent couplings that can be controlled experimentally. By applying maximum-likelihood techniques, we show that the ``measurement'' of these Feynman diagrams can be reformulated as a problem of multi-parameter point estimation that takes as input a set of Ramsey-type measurements of the qubit. By numerical simulations that consider leading imperfections in trapped-ion devices, we identify the optimal regimes in which Feynman diagrams could be reconstructed from measured data with low systematic and stochastic errors. We discuss how these ideas can be generalized to finite temperatures via the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, contributing to a bottom-up approach to probe quantum simulators of lattice field theories by systematically increasing the qubit-oscillator number.</description>

      <title>Quantum real-time evolution using tensor renormalization group methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an approach for approximate real-time evolution of quantum systems using Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) methods originally developed for imaginary time. We use Higher- Order TRG (HOTRG) to generate a coarse-grained time evolution operator for a 1+1D Transverse Ising Model with a longitudinal field. We show that it is effective and efficient in evolving Gaussian wave packets for one and two particles in the disordered phase. Near criticality behavior is more challenging in real-time. We compare our algorithm with local simulators for universal quantum computers and discuss possible benchmarking in the near future.</description>

      <title>Condensation and prescaling in spatial Polyakov loop correlations far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of spatial Polyakov loop correlations, which provide gauge-invariant observables akin to effective particle numbers for gluon plasmas, are investigated within real-time $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theory at weak couplings and large gluon occupations. The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector and scalar contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results for single axial-vector and scalar meson pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) part of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In the dispersive approach to these quantities (in narrow width approximation) the central inputs are the corresponding space-like electromagnetic transition form factors. We determine these directly using a functional approach to QCD by Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations in the very same setup we used previously to determine pseudo-scalar meson exchange ($\pi$, $\eta$ and $\eta'$) as well as meson ($\pi$ and $K$) box contributions. Particular care is taken to preserve gauge invariance and to comply with short distance constraints in both the form factors and the HLbL tensor. Our result for the contributions from a tower of axial-vector states including short distance constraints is $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{AV-tower+SDC}] = 27.5 \,(3.2) \times 10^{-11}$. For the combined contributions from $f_0(980), a_0(980), f_0(1370)$ and $a_0(1450)$ we find $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{scalar}] = -1.6 \,(5) \times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic effective field theory for heavy exotic hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.00552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective field theory to describe hadrons with two heavy quarks without any assumption on the typical distance between the heavy quarks with respect to the typical hadronic scale. The construction is based on Non-Relativistic QCD and inspired in the strong coupling regime of Potential Non-Relativistic QCD. We construct the effective theory at leading and next-to-leading order in the inverse heavy-quark mass expansion for arbitrary quantum numbers of the light degrees of freedom. Hence our results hold for hybrids, tetraquarks, double heavy baryons and pentaquarks, for which we also present the corresponding operators at Non-Relativistic level. At leading order, the effective theory enjoys heavy quark spin symmetry and corresponds to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. At next-to-leading order, spin and velocity dependent terms arise, which produce splittings in the heavy-quark spin symmetry multiplets. A concrete application to double heavy baryons is presented in an accompanying paper.</description>
