      <title>PhysDNet: Physics-Guided Decomposition Network of Side-Scan Sonar Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Side-scan sonar (SSS) imagery is widely used for seafloor mapping and underwater remote sensing, yet the measured intensity is strongly influenced by seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. This entanglement makes the imagery highly view-dependent and reduces the robustness of downstream analysis. In this letter, we present PhysDNet, a physics-guided multi-branch network that decouples SSS images into three interpretable fields: seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and propagation loss. By embedding the Lambertian reflection model, PhysDNet reconstructs sonar intensity from these components, enabling self-supervised training without ground-truth annotations. Experiments show that the decomposed representations preserve stable geological structures, capture physically consistent illumination and attenuation, and produce reliable shadow maps. These findings demonstrate that physics-guided decomposition provides a stable and interpretable domain for SSS analysis, improving both physical consistency and downstream tasks such as registration and shadow interpretation.</description>

      <title>Concept drift of simple forecast models as a diagnostic of low-frequency, regime-dependent atmospheric reorganisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven weather prediction models implicitly assume that the statistical relationship between predictors and targets is stationary. Under anthropogenic climate change, this assumption is violated, yet the structure of the resulting concept drift remains poorly understood. Here we introduce concept drift of simple forecast models as a diagnostic of atmospheric reorganisation. Using ERA5 reanalysis, we quantify drift in spatially explicit linear models of daily mean sea-level pressure and 2\,m temperature. Models are trained on the 1950s and 2000s and evaluated on 2020 tp 2024; their performance difference defines a local, interpretable drift metric. By decomposing errors by frequency band, circulation regime and region, and by mapping drift globally, we show that drift is dominated by low-frequency variability and is strongly regime-dependent. Over the North Atlantic-European sector, low-frequency drift peaks in positive NAO despite a stable large-scale NAO pattern, while Western European summer temperature drift is tightly linked to changes in land-atmosphere coupling rather than mean warming alone. In winter, extreme high-pressure frequencies increase mainly in neutral and negative NAO, whereas structural drift is concentrated in positive NAO and Alpine hotspots. Benchmarking against variance-based diagnostics shows that drift aligns much more with changes in temporal persistence than with changes in volatility or extremes. These findings demonstrate that concept drift can serve as a physically meaningful diagnostic of evolving predictability, revealing aspects of atmospheric reorganisation that are invisible to standard deviation and storm-track metrics.</description>

      <title>Investigating impacts of dust events on atmospheric surface temperature in Southwest Asia using AERONET data, satellite recordings, and atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust layers have already been reported to have negative impacts on the radiation budget of the atmosphere. But the questions are: How does the atmospheric surface temperature change during a dust outbreak, and what is its temporal correlation with variations of the dust outbreak strength? We investigated these at selected AERONET sites, including Bahrain, IASBS, Karachi, KAUST Campus, Kuwait University, Lahore, Mezaira, Solar Village, in Southwest Asia, and Dushanbe in Central Asia, using available data from 1998 to 2024. The aerosol optical depth at 870 nm and the temperature recorded at each site are taken as measures of dust outbreak strength and atmospheric surface temperature, respectively. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the aerosol optical depths recorded by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on board the Aqua and Terra satellites are used to specify the sources of the dust outbreaks. Our investigations show that in most cases, the temperature decreases during a dust outbreak, but in a considerable number of cases, the temperature rises. Temperature changes are mostly less than 5 {\deg}C. We found that a dust outbreak may affect the temperature even up to two days after its highest intensity time. This effect is more profound at sites far from large dust sources, such as IASBS in northwest Iran. For sites that are located on either a dust source or very close to it, the temperature and dust optical depth vary almost synchronously.</description>

      <title>Periodic extreme rainfall in a warmer climate due to stronger convectively-coupled waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical regions may experience periodic extreme precipitation and suffer from associated periodic deluges in a warmer climate. Recent studies conducted small-domain (around 100 km x 100 km) atmospheric model simulations and found that precipitation transitions from a steady state to a periodic oscillation state in a hothouse climate when the sea surface temperature reaches 320-325 K. Here we conduct global-scale atmospheric model simulations with different complexity, and we find that tropical precipitation in convective regions already transitions to a O(10 day) periodic oscillation state with a O(100 mm/day) amplitude at 305-310 K. This temperature is substantially lower than previously reported, and within reach in a century under a high carbon emission scenario. We attribute the onset of the periodic extreme precipitation to the intensification of convectively-coupled waves, which occurs at temperatures much lower than the radiative mechanism responsible for the transition around 320-325 K identified before.</description>

      <title>Topological Structure of the Cyclonic-Anticyclonic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-scale structure and temporal evolution of cyclonic and anticyclonic systems in the North Atlantic using persistent homology applied to daily sea-level pressure anomalies from the ERA5 reanalysis (1950-2022). By interpreting the pressure field as a cubical complex and computing its sublevel- and superlevel-set filtrations, we identify degree-1 topological features corresponding respectively to anticyclones surrounded by low pressure and cyclones surrounded by high pressure. We quantify their intensity through total persistence and track their evolution over time using optimal matchings and Wasserstein distances between consecutive persistence diagrams. The method captures coherent, long-lived structures without requiring feature-tracking heuristics and reveals robust seasonal patterns: both cyclonic and anticyclonic 1-holes exhibit strong winter maxima and summer minima in total persistence, lifetime, and frequency. Cyclonic features are more persistent, more numerous, and longer-lived than their anticyclonic counterparts, consistent with the climatological dominance of the Icelandic Low in winter and the weaker, more transient nature of anticyclonic highs. Long trajectories correspond to known large-scale structures such as winter cyclonic deepening and blocking episodes. These results demonstrate that persistent homology provides an objective, filtering-free characterization of pressure-field organization and offers a topological framework to analyze the dynamics and variability of mid-latitude circulation.</description>

      <title>The modulation of vortex growth by periodic convective activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important process in tropical cyclone formation is the development of a deep, warm core, which corresponds to the growth of a barotropic cyclone. Persistent convective activity is known to be crucial for the growth of barotropic vorticity. However, it remains unclear whether the fluctuating component of convective activity, such as that caused by the diurnal cycle and inertial-gravity waves, also accelerates the vortex development. To investigate this problem, numerical simulations are performed in an axisymmetric model with the Boussinesq approximation on the f-plane. Convection is parameterized with a bulk-plume mass-flux scheme. To represent a mesoscale convective system modulated by the diurnal cycle, periodic convective mass flux is imposed in a local region. The convection induces periodic diabatic heating and convective momentum transfer in the vertical direction (CMT). The CMT is an irreversible effect that breaks the quadrature phase relation between vertical velocity and vertical vorticity, producing a residual barotropic vorticity in each cycle. The barotropic vorticity consists of a barotropic cyclonic core and an anticyclonic shell. The cyclonic core is produced by the vertical advection and stretching of vertical vorticity. The anticyclonic shell is produced by the radial advection and tilting of radial vorticity. The analytical solution reproduces the formation and growth of the core-shell vorticity structure. This research reveals a potential acceleration effect of periodic convective activity on tropical cyclone genesis.</description>

      <title>Noctilucent Clouds Modulated by Strong 5-day Planetary Wave in 2025: Amplitudes, Phases and Altitudes Based on Ground-Based Observations and Satellite Temperature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the summer season of 2025, noctilucent clouds (NLC) were observed at the latitudes 55-60N from the late May until the late August. A distinct 5-day periodicity in their occurrence emerged following the summer solstice. Analysis of EOS Aura/MLS satellite data revealed that this effect was driven by a westward 5-day planetary wave, the amplitude of which was twice that of any previous northern summer since the start of the EOS Aura measurements in 2005. This study details the evolution of this exceptional planetary wave throughout the summer. Furthermore, NLC altitudes were determined via triangulation and colorimetry and were compared with MLS temperature profiles, enabling the determination of a mean positive phase lag for NLC occurrence relative to the temperature minimum.</description>

      <title>An ALE approach to reduce spurious numerical mixing through variational minimizers: application to internal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spurious numerical mixing is a frequent phenomenon in ocean models. In the present paper, we present an efficient and robust methodology that defines the vertical grid motion so that this mixing is reduced. This motion is defined through the solution of an optimization problem that -- using the ideas of the calculus of variations -- results in an elliptic equation. This framework is generally applicable to any ocean model that uses an ALE vertical coordinate and can be tuned to fit the modeler's specific needs based on the guidelines presented herein. The method is applied to the nonhydrostatic solver presented by the authors in [Alexandris-Galanopoulos et al., 2024] and its applicability in fully nonlinear internal waves is investigated for the demanding test cases of wave breaking and overturning. These numerical benchmarks show the ability of the method to reduce spurious mixing, while attaining the physical relevancy of the results.</description>

      <title>Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most applications in high-dimensional complex systems predict future states individually. This approach struggles to model complex temporal dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of uncertainty inherent to the systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5-degree resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines, including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful general framework for tackling diffusion-based dynamics forecasting problems where modeling uncertainty propagation is paramount.</description>

      <title>Cloud4D: Estimating Cloud Properties at a High Spatial and Temporal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($&lt;10\%$) against collocated radar measurements. Code and data are available on our project page https://cloud4d.jacob-lin.com/.</description>
