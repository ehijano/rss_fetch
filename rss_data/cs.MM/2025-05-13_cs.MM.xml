      <title>Emotion-Qwen: Training Hybrid Experts for Unified Emotion and General Vision-Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion understanding in videos aims to accurately recognize and interpret individuals' emotional states by integrating contextual, visual, textual, and auditory cues. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant progress in general vision-language (VL) tasks, their performance in emotion-specific scenarios remains limited. Moreover, fine-tuning LMMs on emotion-related tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, hindering their ability to generalize across diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we present Emotion-Qwen, a tailored multimodal framework designed to enhance both emotion understanding and general VL reasoning. Emotion-Qwen incorporates a sophisticated Hybrid Compressor based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, which dynamically routes inputs to balance emotion-specific and general-purpose processing. The model is pre-trained in a three-stage pipeline on large-scale general and emotional image datasets to support robust multimodal representations. Furthermore, we construct the Video Emotion Reasoning (VER) dataset, comprising more than 40K bilingual video clips with fine-grained descriptive annotations, to further enrich Emotion-Qwen's emotional reasoning capability. Experimental results demonstrate that Emotion-Qwen achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks, while maintaining competitive results on general VL tasks.

      <title>EmoVLM-KD: Fusing Distilled Expertise with Vision-Language Models for Visual Emotion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual emotion analysis, which has gained considerable attention in the field of affective computing, aims to predict the dominant emotions conveyed by an image. Despite advancements in visual emotion analysis with the emergence of vision-language models, we observed that instruction-tuned vision-language models and conventional vision models exhibit complementary strengths in visual emotion analysis, as vision-language models excel in certain cases, whereas vision models perform better in others. This finding highlights the need to integrate these capabilities to enhance the performance of visual emotion analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose EmoVLM-KD, an instruction-tuned vision-language model augmented with a lightweight module distilled from conventional vision models. Instead of deploying both models simultaneously, which incurs high computational costs, we transfer the predictive patterns of a conventional vision model into the vision-language model using a knowledge distillation framework. Our approach first fine-tunes a vision-language model on emotion-specific instruction data and then attaches a distilled module to its visual encoder while keeping the vision-language model frozen. Predictions from the vision language model and the distillation module are effectively balanced by a gate module, which subsequently generates the final outcome. Extensive experiments show that EmoVLM-KD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual emotion analysis benchmark datasets, outperforming the existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available in https://github.com/sange1104/EmoVLM-KD.</description>

      <title>Bridging Ears and Eyes: Analyzing Audio and Visual Large Language Models to Humans in Visible Sound Recognition and Reducing Their Sensory Gap via Cross-Modal Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) are considered experts at recognizing sound objects, yet their performance relative to LLMs in other sensory modalities, such as visual or audio-visual LLMs, and to humans using their ears, eyes, or both remains unexplored. To investigate this, we systematically evaluate audio, visual, and audio-visual LLMs, specifically Qwen2-Audio, Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-Omni, against humans in recognizing sound objects of different classes from audio-only, silent video, or sounded video inputs. We uncover a performance gap between Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2-VL that parallels the sensory discrepancy between human ears and eyes. To reduce this gap, we introduce a cross-modal distillation framework, where an LLM in one modality serves as the teacher and another as the student, with knowledge transfer in sound classes predicted as more challenging to the student by a heuristic model. Distillation in both directions, from Qwen2-VL to Qwen2-Audio and vice versa, leads to notable improvements, particularly in challenging classes. This work highlights the sensory gap in LLMs from a human-aligned perspective and proposes a principled approach to enhancing modality-specific perception in multimodal LLMs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Audio Question Answering Toward Acoustic Content Reasoning in The DCASE 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Task 5 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge: an Audio Question Answering (AQA) benchmark spanning multiple domains of sound understanding. This task defines three QA subsets (Bioacoustics, Temporal Soundscapes, and Complex QA) to test audio-language models on interactive question-answering over diverse acoustic scenes. We describe the dataset composition (from marine mammal calls to soundscapes and complex real-world clips), the evaluation protocol (top-1 accuracy with answer-shuffling robustness), and baseline systems (Qwen2-Audio-7B, AudioFlamingo 2, Gemini-2-Flash). Preliminary results on the development set are compared, showing strong variation across models and subsets. This challenge aims to advance the audio understanding and reasoning capabilities of audio-language models toward human-level acuity, which are crucial for enabling AI agents to perceive and interact about the world effectively.</description>

      <title>Bridging Discrete and Continuous: A Multimodal Strategy for Complex Emotion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of human-computer interaction, accurately recognizing and interpreting human emotions is crucial yet challenging due to the complexity and subtlety of emotional expressions. This study explores the potential for detecting a rich and flexible range of emotions through a multimodal approach which integrates facial expressions, voice tones, and transcript from video clips. We propose a novel framework that maps variety of emotions in a three-dimensional Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space, which could reflect the fluctuations and positivity/negativity of emotions to enable a more variety and comprehensive representation of emotional states. We employed K-means clustering to transit emotions from traditional discrete categorization to a continuous labeling system and built a classifier for emotion recognition upon this system. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using the MER2024 dataset, which contains culturally consistent video clips from Chinese movies and TV series, annotated with both discrete and open-vocabulary emotion labels. Our experiment successfully achieved the transformation between discrete and continuous models, and the proposed model generated a more diverse and comprehensive set of emotion vocabulary while maintaining strong accuracy.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Image Captioning Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) hinder reliability and real-world applicability, usually stemming from distribution shifts between pretraining data and test samples. Existing solutions, such as retraining or fine-tuning on additional data, demand significant computational resources and labor-intensive data collection, while ensemble-based methods incur additional costs by introducing auxiliary VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework using reinforcement learning to mitigate hallucinations during inference without retraining or any auxiliary VLMs. By updating only the learnable parameters in the layer normalization of the language model (approximately 0.003% of the model parameters), our method reduces distribution shifts between test samples and pretraining samples. A CLIP-based hallucination evaluation model is proposed to provide dual rewards to VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.4% and 17.3% reduction in hallucination rates on LLaVA and InstructBLIP, respectively. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 68.3% improvement in hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Audio Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, CNN architectures have produced compelling models of sound perception and cognition, learning hierarchical organizations of features. Analogous to successes in computer vision, audio feature classification can be optimized for a particular task of interest, over a wide variety of datasets and labels. In fact similar architectures designed for image understanding have proven effective for acoustic scene analysis. Here we propose applying Transformer based architectures without convolutional layers to raw audio signals. On a standard dataset of Free Sound 50K,comprising of 200 categories, our model outperforms convolutional models to produce state of the art results. This is significant as unlike in natural language processing and computer vision, we do not perform unsupervised pre-training for outperforming convolutional architectures. On the same training set, with respect mean aver-age precision benchmarks, we show a significant improvement. We further improve the performance of Transformer architectures by using techniques such as pooling inspired from convolutional net-work designed in the past few years. In addition, we also show how multi-rate signal processing ideas inspired from wavelets, can be applied to the Transformer embeddings to improve the results. We also show how our models learns a non-linear non constant band-width filter-bank, which shows an adaptable time frequency front end representation for the task of audio understanding, different from other tasks e.g. pitch estimation.</description>

      <title>PAHA: Parts-Aware Audio-Driven Human Animation with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose PAHA, an end-to-end audio-driven upper-body human animation framework with diffusion model. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</description>
