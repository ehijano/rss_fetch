      <title>Periodicity Uncovered: A Deep Dive into Bott's Theorems in K-Theory and Fiber Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparison between two versions of Bott Periodicity Theorems: one in topological K-theory and the other in stable homotopy groups of classical groups. It begins with an introduction to K-theory, discussing vector bundles and their role in understanding the algebraic and topological aspects of these spaces. Then the two versions of Bott periodicity, as well as the topological notions necessary to understand them, are further explored. The aim is to illustrate the connections and distinctions between these two theorems, deepening our understanding of their underlying mathematical structures such as topological K-theory and fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>The equivariant degree and an enriched count of rational cubics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the equivariant degree and local degree of a proper $G$-equivariant map between smooth $G$-manifolds when $G$ is a compact Lie group and prove a local to global result. We show the local degree can be used to compute the equivariant Euler characteristic of a smooth, compact $G$-manifold and the Euler number of a relatively oriented $G$-equivariant vector bundle when $G$ is finite. As an application, we give an equivariantly enriched count of rational plane cubics through a $G$-invariant set of 8 general points in $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$, valued in the representation ring and Burnside ring of a finite group. When $\mathbb{Z}/2$ acts by pointwise complex conjugation this recovers a signed count of real rational cubics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an elliptic CW-complex $X$, we denote its group of self-homotopy equivalences as $\E(X)$, and its subgroup consisting of elements inducing the identity on the homology groups as $\E_{*}(X)$. This paper aims to investigate how the homology groups of $X$ influence the finiteness of $\E(X)$ and $\E_{*}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Globular subdivisions are dihomotopy equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any globular subdivision of multipointed $d$-spaces gives rise to a dihomotopy equivalence between the associated flows. The proof involves a new Reedy category which is a tweak of the one used to prove the left properness of the q-model category of flows. As a straightforward application, the flows associated to two multipointed $d$-spaces related by a finite zigzag of globular subdivisions have isomorphic branching and merging homology theories.</description>

      <title>The plus construction with respect to subrings of the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of universal $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclic spaces $\mathcal M$, for any subset $J$ of the prime numbers. The corresponding nullification functors provide thus plus construction functors for ordinary homology with $\mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$ coefficients. Motivated by classical results about Quillen's plus construction for integral homology, we prove that the $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclization functor and the $\mathcal M$-cellularization functor coincide. We show that the acyclization-plus construction fiber sequence is always a cofiber sequence for simply connected spaces, but almost never so when the plus construction is not simply connected, unlike in the classical case.</description>

      <title>The shift-homological spectrum and parametrising kernels of rank functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any compactly generated triangulated category we introduce two topological spaces, the shift-spectrum and the shift-homological spectrum. We use them to parametrise a family of thick subcategories of the compact objects, which we call radical. These spaces can be viewed as non-monoidal analogues of the Balmer and homological spectra arising in tensor-triangular geometry: we prove that for monogenic tensor-triangulated categories the Balmer spectrum is a subspace of the shift-spectrum. To construct these analogues we utilise quotients of the module category, rather than the lattice theoretic methods which have been adopted in other approaches. We characterise radical thick subcategories and show in certain cases, such as the perfect derived categories of tame hereditary algebras or monogenic tensor-triangulated categories, that every thick subcategory is radical. We establish a close relationship between the shift-homological spectrum and the set of irreducible integral rank functions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for every radical thick subcategory to be given by an intersection of kernels of rank functions. In order to facilitate these results, we prove that both spaces we introduce may equivalently be described in terms of the Ziegler spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any group $G$ occurs as $\E(X)$, where $X$ is CW-complex of finite dimension and $\E(X)$ denotes its group of self-homotopy equivalence. Thus, we generalize a well know-theorem due to Costoya and Viruel \cite{CV} asserting that any finite group occurs as $\E(X)$, where $X$ is rational elliptic space.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis in Air Traffic Management: the shape of big flight data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing flight trajectory data sets poses challenges due to the intricate interconnections among various factors and the high dimensionality of the data. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a way of analyzing big data sets focusing on the topological features this data sets have as point clouds in some metric space. Techniques as the ones that TDA provides are suitable for dealing with high dimensionality and intricate interconnections. This paper introduces TDA and its tools and methods as a way to derive meaningful insights from ATM data. Our focus is on employing TDA to extract valuable information related to airports. Specifically, by utilizing persistence landscapes (a potent TDA tool) we generate footprints for each airport. These footprints, obtained by averaging over a specific time period, are based on the deviation of trajectories and delays. We apply this method to the set of Spanish' airports in the Summer Season of 2018. Remarkably, our results align with the established Spanish airport classification and raise intriguing questions for further exploration. This analysis serves as a proof of concept, showcasing the potential application of TDA in the ATM field. While previous works have outlined the general applicability of TDA in aviation, this paper marks the first comprehensive application of TDA to a substantial volume of ATM data. Finally, we present conclusions and guidelines to address future challenges in the ATM domain.</description>

      <title>Core Bifiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation of this paper is to recognize a geometric shape from a noisy sample in the form of a point cloud. Inspired by the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, we introduce the core dissimilarity, from which we construct the core bifiltration. We also consider the Delaunay core bifiltration by intersecting with Voronoi cells, giving us a filtered simplicial complex of smaller size. A major advantage of the (Delaunay) core bifiltration is that, for each filtration value, it admits a good cover of balls. By the persistent nerve theorem, the nerve of this cover is homotopy equivalent to the (Delaunay) core bifiltration. We show that the multicover-, core- and Delaunay core bifiltrations are all interleaved, and that they enjoy similar stability properties with respect to the Prohorov distance. We have performed experiments with the Delaunay core bifiltration. In the experiments, we calculated persistent homology along lines in the two-dimensional persistence parameter space, and computed multipersistence module approximations.</description>

Abstract: We give a direct construction of the ring spectrum of spherical Witt vectors of a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra R as the completion of the spherical monoid algebra $\mathbb{S}[R]$ of the multiplicative monoid $(R,\cdot)$ at the ideal $I = \mathrm{fib}(\mathbb{S}[R] \to R)$. This generalizes a construction of Cuntz and Deninger. We also use this to give a description of the category of p-complete modules over the spherical Witt vectors and a universal property for spherical Witt vectors as an $\mathbb{E}_1$-ring.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{CAT}(\kappa)}$ Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact shapes $X\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ that are $\mathrm{CAT}(\kappa)$ in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact $\mathrm{CAT}(\kappa)$ spaces. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. In particular, we introduce a new parameter, called the {\em restricted distortion}, which is a generalization of the well-known global distortion of embedding. We show examples of Euclidean subspaces, for which the known parameters such as the reach, $\mu$--reach and weak features size vanish, whereas the restricted distortion is finite, making our reconstruction results applicable for such spaces.</description>

      <title>The Induced Matching Distance: A Novel Topological Metric with Applications in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the induced matching distance, a novel topological metric designed to compare discrete structures represented by a symmetric non-negative function. We apply this notion to analyze agent trajectories over time. We use dynamic time warping to measure trajectory similarity and compute the 0-dimensional persistent homology to identify relevant connected components, which, in our context, correspond to groups of similar trajectories. To track the evolution of these components across time, we compute induced matching distances, which preserve the coherence of their dynamic behavior. We then obtain a 1-dimensional signal that quantifies the consistency of trajectory groups over time. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively differentiates between various agent behaviors, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for topological analysis in robotics and related fields.</description>

      <title>PHLP: Sole Persistent Homology for Link Prediction - Interpretable Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP), inferring the connectivity between nodes, is a significant research area in graph data, where a link represents essential information on relationships between nodes. Although graph neural network (GNN)-based models have achieved high performance in LP, understanding why they perform well is challenging because most comprise complex neural networks. We employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method that helps analyze the topological information of graphs, to interpret the features used for prediction. We propose a novel method that employs PH for LP (PHLP) focusing on how the presence or absence of target links influences the overall topology. The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, PHLP is the first method of applying PH to LP without GNNs. The proposed approach, employing PH while not relying on neural networks, enables the identification of crucial factors for improving performance.</description>

      <title>Quadratically Enriched Plane Curve Counting via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the quadratically enriched count of rational curves in a smooth toric del Pezzo surface passing through $k$-rational points and pairs of conjugate points in quadratic field extensions $k\subset k(\sqrt{d_i})$ can be determined by counting certain tropical stable maps through vertically stretched point conditions with a suitable multiplicity. Building on the floor diagram technique in tropical geometry, we provide an algorithm to compute these numbers.
  Our tropical algorithm computes not only these new quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, but simultaneously also the complex Gromov-Witten invariant, the real Welschinger invariant counting curves satisfying real point conditions only, the real Welschinger invariant of curves satisfying pairs of complex conjugate and real point conditions, and the quadratically enriched count of curves satisfying $k$-rational point conditions.</description>
