      <title>Ab Initio Random Matrix Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use ab initio electronic-structure methods to investigate random-matrix theory (RMT) universality in molecular electronic structure. Using single-reference electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, configuration-interaction singles (CIS), density functional theory, and linear-response time-dependent density-functional theory, we compute single-particle orbital energies and many-electron excitations of several representative molecules (benzene, alanine, 1-phenylethylamine, methyloxirane, and helicene chains). For generic low-symmetry geometries, the unfolded spectra of these ab initio Hamiltonians exhibit Wigner-Dyson level statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). For extended helicene chains we explicitly restrict to bound valence excitations below the ionization threshold and still observe GOE statistics, indicating that the RMT universality is present for physical states of direct relevance to real molecules. We further explore the electric and magnetic field dependence of the molecular electronic spectra. The variance of electric polarizability (level curvature K) is predicted to be non-analytic in the magnetic field which serves as an infrared cutoff, &lt;K^2&gt; proportional to log(1/|B|). We observe a transition to the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by increasing the magnetic fields, although it occurs only at magnetic fields far beyond experimentally accessible scales. Our results indicate that random matrix universality provides a general framework for organizing ab initio predictions of interacting electron spectra in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Higher Berry Phase via Boundary Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher Berry phase has recently been proposed to study the topology of the space of gapped many-body quantum systems. In this work, we develop a boundary-scattering approach to detect higher Berry phases in one-dimensional gapped free-fermion systems. By coupling a gapless lead to the gapped system, we demonstrate that the higher Berry invariant can be obtained by studying the higher winding number of the boundary reflection matrix. The resulting topological invariant is robust against perturbations such as disorder. Our approach establishes a connection between higher Berry invariants and transport properties, thereby providing a potentially experimentally accessible probe of parametrized topological phases.</description>

      <title>Rotational Phonons Drive Low-Energy Kinks in Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals ubiquitous quasiparticle ``kinks'' near $\sim$70 meV and $\sim$40 meV across cuprate superconductors, often accompanied by peak--dip--hump (PDH) structures. These features point to strong coupling between electrons and low-energy bosonic excitations, but the microscopic origin has remained elusive due to the limitations of conventional density-functional theory (DFT) and the high cost of beyond-DFT methods. Here, we systematically study the electron--phonon coupling (EPC) in hole-doped infinite-layer CaCuO$_2$ using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) density functional, explicitly including magnetic effects. We find a substantial EPC strength $\lambda$ of $\sim$0.5 in the magnetic phase, producing kinks and PDH structures in the 40-80~meV window in excellent agreement with experiments. The dominant contribution arises from rotational oxygen phonons, while breathing modes contribute little. Our results establish strong EPC in cuprates, highlight the key role of rotational phonons, and provide a framework for understanding spectral anomalies in cuprates and beyond.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Discovery of Intermediate Phase Order in the Frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Model via Prometheus Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice exhibits a debated intermediate phase between N\'eel antiferromagnetic and stripe ordered regimes, with competing theories proposing plaquette valence bond, nematic, and quantum spin liquid ground states. We apply the Prometheus variational autoencoder framework -- previously validated on classical (2D, 3D Ising) and quantum (disordered transverse field Ising) phase transitions -- to systematically explore the $J_1$-$J_2$ phase diagram via unsupervised analysis of exact diagonalization ground states for a $4 \times 4$ lattice. Through dense parameter scans of $J_2/J_1 \in [0.3, 0.7]$ with step size 0.01 and comprehensive latent space analysis, we investigate the nature of the intermediate regime using unsupervised order parameter discovery and critical point detection via multiple independent methods. This work demonstrates the application of rigorously validated machine learning methods to open questions in frustrated quantum magnetism, where traditional order parameter identification is challenged by competing interactions and limited accessible system sizes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropic pinning and symmetric breaking induced by interfacial coupling in topological-like ruthenate superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial engineering enables various emergent effects such as spin reorientations and transport anisotropy. Noncollinear spin textures are essential for realizing many emergent quantum transport phenomena. However, driving such spin structures requires precise control of the interfacial magnetic coupling in complex oxide heterostructures. Here, by utilizing competing exchange interactions at the interface between ferromagnetic metal SrRuO3 and ferromagnetic insulator LaCoO3, we discovered a noncollinear spin configuration in SrRuO3 sublayers. Magnetic stripes were induced by out-of-plane rather than in-plane magnetic fields, indicating strong anisotropy pinning in our superlattices. The observed magneto-transport anisotropy is well explained by our proposed spin configurations, accounting for contributions from both bulk and interface of the SrRuO3 layers. More interestingly, magnetic skymionic textures were absent even at high magnetic fields. The interfacial exchange interaction overwhelms the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that stabilizes skyrmions, featuring a higher exchange coupling energy than that for the topological spin textures. Our work highlights the potential of interfacial engineering in tuning the spintronic properties by designing proper interfacial interactions.</description>

      <title>Hall effect on nontrivial quadrupole order in quasi-kagome compound URhSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the transport properties of the quasi-kagome compound URhSn, which exhibits successive phase transitions at TC =16 K (ferromagnetic phase) and TO =54 K (intermediate phase). A large anomalous Hall component is present along the easy-magnetization axis (H|| [0001]), and the Hall resistivity shows very complex temperature- and field-dependence, with a sign reversal at low temperatures. The Hall resistivity exhibits a nonlinear and unusual field-dependence. Interestingly, there exists an unusual Hall component that is not proportional to the magnetic susceptibility for H || [0001] in both the intermediate and ferromagnetic states. These results reveal unconventional transport properties of URhSn, providing important insights into nontrivial multipolar phases in 5f- electron systems.</description>

      <title>Combining matrix product states and mean-field theory to capture magnetic order in quasi-1D cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasi-one-dimensional strongly correlated materials using a multi-step approach based on density functional theory, downfolding techniques, and tensor-network simulations. The downfolding procedure yields effective multiband Hubbard models that capture the competition between electron hopping and local Coulomb interactions relevant to the system's low-energy properties. The resulting multiband Hubbard models are solved using matrix product states. Applied to Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, SrBaCuO$_3$, and Ba$_2$CuO$_3$, this purely one-dimensional treatment yields no long-range magnetic order, in contrast to the magnetic ordering observed experimentally. To account for this behavior, we extend the multi-step approach by incorporating interchain couplings through a self-consistent mean-field scheme. This combined approach stabilizes finite staggered magnetizations, providing a consistent description of magnetic order in agreement with experiment. For Sr$_2$CuO$_{3.5}$ and SrCuO$_2$, we also tested an approach proposed for ladder materials, however, we find that these materials are not well suited for this approach due to the small magnitude of the intraladder hopping parameters.</description>

      <title>Tighter thermalization bounds for perturbed quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional eigenstates that defy thermalization, enabling long-lived coherent dynamics in strongly interacting systems. However, their stability under perturbations remains inadequately understood. In this work, we derive improved lower bounds on the thermalization time of QMBS under local perturbations with strength $\lambda$. Using both numerical simulations and analytical reasoning, we show that exact QMBS exhibit slow thermalization, with a timescale scaling as $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-1/d})$ owing to the stabilizing restricted spectrum-generating algebra (RSGA), which is a significant improvement over previous bounds (e.g., $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-1/(d+1)})$). Counterintuitively, approximate QMBS can thermalize even more slowly under generic perturbations, exhibiting $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-2})$ scaling due to second-order perturbative effects in the absence of such protective structure. These distinct thermalization behaviors clarify how exact and approximate scars maintain coherence. Our work advances previous findings by establishing a tighter bound on the thermalization time, clarifying when scarred dynamics remain long-lived under weak but generic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Crystallography-driven molecularization of a two-dimensional spin-$3/2$ magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22005v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-spin two-dimensional magnets are generally expected to develop conventional long-range order once the dominant exchange scale becomes appreciable. The layered spin-$3/2$ maple-leaf compound Na$_2$Mn$_3$O$_7$ defies this expectation: despite sizable antiferromagnetic interactions and no evident disorder, it exhibits no magnetic ordering and displays two well-separated thermodynamic crossover scales. We show that this behavior originates from a crystallography-driven molecularization of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The low-symmetry structure partitions the Mn sublattice into inequivalent exchange pathways, generating a pronounced hierarchy that nearly isolates antiferromagnetic hexagons. Magnetic correlations therefore develop in two stages: first within individual hexagons at a scale set by the dominant exchange, and only at much lower temperatures do frustrated inter-hexagon couplings attempt to establish coherence across the lattice. While isolated hexagons reproduce the two-step thermodynamic structure, the experimentally relevant temperature scales emerge only once the hexagons are embedded in the frustrated two-dimensional network. The resulting quantum ground state is magnetically disordered, characterized by strong intra-hexagon correlations and rapidly decaying inter-hexagon correlations. These results identify crystallographic inequivalence as a materials-level mechanism for stabilizing molecularized and quantum-disordered states even in large-spin two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Mott Intermittency at the Metal-Insulator Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resistivity maximum at a temperature $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$ is a recurring feature of bandwidth-tuned Mott systems, yet its meaning remains controversial: is it a coherence-incoherence crossover of an electronically homogeneous metal, or does it mark the onset of transport through a mixed landscape of metallic and insulating regions? Even more debated is whether a true phase-coexistence regime survives in the relevant parameter range, or whether apparent inhomogeneity is merely extrinsic. Here we address these questions by moving beyond temperature sweeps and probe charge transport in the time domain. Near $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that the resistance of a model system, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott spin liquid material, exhibits clear random-telegraph switching between discrete levels over long timescales. The statistics of the switching - sharp two-level behavior with thermally activated dwell times - point to a mesoscopic "current-controlling" region that dynamically toggles between metallic and insulating states, intermittently opening and closing the dominant conduction channel. This characteristic fluctuating dynamics provides direct evidence for intrinsic metal-insulator coexistence and establishes $T\sim T_{\mathrm{max}}$ as the regime of Mott intermittency, where transport is governed by stochastic domain switching rather than quasiparticle decoherence.</description>

      <title>Lowering the temperature of two-dimensional fermionic tensor networks with cluster expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing the time-evolution operator as a tensor network constitutes a key ingredient in several algorithms for studying quantum lattice systems at finite temperature or in a non-equilibrium setting. For a Hamiltonian composed of strictly short-ranged interactions, the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is the main technique for obtaining such a representation. In [B.~Vanhecke, L.~Vanderstraeten and F.~Verstraete, Physical Review A, L020402 (2021)], an alternative strategy, the cluster expansion, was introduced. This approach naturally preserves internal and lattice symmetries and can more easily be extended to higher-order representations or longer-ranged interactions. We extend the cluster expansion to two-dimensional fermionic systems, and employ it to construct projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) approximations of Gibbs states. We also discuss and benchmark different truncation schemes for multiplying layers of PEPOs together. Applying the resulting framework to a two-dimensional spinless fermion model with attractive interactions, we resolve a clear phase boundary at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Chiral Weyl-Kondo semimetals and hexagonal heavy fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong correlation, in concert with symmetry and topology, engenders novel gapless phases of matter, though only a tip of the iceberg has been seen. An exemplary framework is provided by Weyl-Kondo semimetals, in which Weyl fermions develop through crystalline symmetry constraints on the emergent low-energy heavy-fermion excitations. This paradigm has opened up new opportunities to explore correlated topologies without a noninteracting counterpart, but fully realizing this potential requires a large base of candidate materials. Here we confront the challenge on both fronts by studying heavy fermion systems with hexagonal space groups. This family contains a large number of chiral nonsymmorphic crystal structures that promote Weyl degeneracies and, in addition, feature geometric frustration in the $f$-electron magnetism. Our calculations for the heavy fermion states identify Weyl-Kondo semimetals with chiral or achiral Weyl nodes in the respective structural classes. We also develop a new search strategy for the difficult case of strongly correlated materials, using a combination of materials database, symmetry classification and experiments, and propose as candidate topological heavy fermion systems the chiral CePt$_2$B and achiral Ce$_2$NiGe$_3$ and Ce$_6$Co$_{2-\delta}$Si$_3$. Our findings raise the prospect for strongly correlated metallic topology in the unusual setting of exotic quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Teleportation transition of surface codes on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological surface code is a leading candidate for harnessing long-range entanglement to protect logical quantum information against errors, and teleportation of logical states is desirable for robust quantum information processing. Nevertheless, scaling up the surface code in quantum teleportation poses a formidable challenge to experiment. Here on a superconducting quantum processor with 125 qubits, we demonstrate the robust teleportation of topological rotated surface code prepared by a linear-depth unitary circuit, with code distances up to 7. We obtain the teleportation phase diagram by tuning the local entangling gates uniformly across a finite threshold. Furthermore, we show that the entangling threshold can be boosted by coherent qubit rotations that inject magic resources beyond the Clifford regime, restoring the duality symmetry of the topological phase, which serves as a guiding principle to minimize the entanglement resource. Our results shed light on simulating and leveraging topological quantum matter on quantum devices, and pave the way to the ultimate goal of distributed fault tolerant quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We report an ambient-pressure Dirac electron (DE) state in a new organic conductor, $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$AuCl$_2$ (BETS = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene). This salt exhibits characteristic transport properties, including large positive in-plane and anomalous negative interlayer magnetoresistance. These signatures closely resemble the high-pressure DE states of $\alpha$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$ (ET = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene). First-principles calculations including spin-orbit coupling identify the electronic state as a quasi-three-dimensional massive Dirac semimetal with residual Fermi pockets. This discovery provides a valuable platform for exploring bulk Dirac fermions without the complexity of high-pressure measurements.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the single-flavor Gross--Neveu--Wilson model from the Grassmann corner transfer matrix renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the single-flavor Gross--Neveu model with Wilson fermions using the Grassmann corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG). The path integral is formulated as a two-dimensional Grassmann tensor network and approximately contracted by the Grassmann CTMRG algorithm. We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality in open quantum systems from the purification perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems host mixed-state phases that go beyond the symmetry-protected topological and spontaneous symmetry-breaking paradigms established for closed, pure-state systems. Developing a unified and physically transparent classification of such phases remains a central challenge. In this work, we introduce a purification-based framework that systematically characterizes all mixed-state phases in one-dimensional systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. By introducing an ancillary $\kappa$ chain and employing decorated domain-wall constructions, we derive eight purified fixed-point Hamiltonians labeled by topological indices $(\mu_{\sigma\tau},\mu_{\tau\kappa},\mu_{\kappa\sigma}) \in \{\pm1\}^3$. Tracing out the ancilla recovers the full structure of mixed-state phases, including symmetric, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking, average symmetry-protected topological phases, and their nontrivial combinations. Interpolations between the eight fixed points naturally define a three-dimensional phase diagram with a cube geometry. The edges correspond to elementary transitions associated with single topological indices, while the faces host intermediate phases arising from competing domain-wall decorations. Along the edges, we identify a class of critical behavior that connects distinct strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking patterns associated with distinct strong subgroups, highlighting a mechanism unique to mixed-state settings. Large-scale tensor-network simulations reveal a rich phase structure, including pyramid-shaped symmetry-breaking regions and a fully symmetry-broken phase at the cube center. Overall, our purification approach provides a geometrically transparent and physically complete classification of mixed-state phases, unified with a single $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\kappa}$ model.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady states in driven holographic Weyl semi-metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Weyl materials provide a controlled setting for exploring Floquet dynamics in open quantum systems, including nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Motivated by the desire for a strongly-coupled description, we employ holography to analyze the formation and stability of a NESS in a Weyl semi-metal induced by an external circularly polarized electric field. A time-periodic steady-state solution is constructed and its stability is determined from the spectrum of out-of-equilibrium quasinormal modes (Floquet exponents). A stable region in the drive parameter space is identified; beyond a critical curve, the Floquet exponents enter the upper half of the complex plane, leading to a superharmonic response. At sufficiently strong driving, chaotic time evolution emerges in the fully nonlinear initial-boundary value problem. The anomaly-induced response of the NESS to an external magnetic field is also computed, and the resulting behavior is related to the previously proposed chiral pumping effect.</description>

Abstract: Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Here, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. In particular, we identify a non-stationary initial slip evolution characterized by an unconventional negative critical exponent $\theta=-0.84(4)$, corroborating the significant impact of fermionic critical fluctuations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonequilibrium scaling theory to incorporate both fermionic and bosonic critical modes, capturing their distinct relaxation behaviors. Armed with the scaling theory, we establish a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced spin-cluster magnetism in a doped kagome spin liquid candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on an ideal kagome lattice. However, lattice imperfections can have substantial effects which are as yet not well understood. In recent work, the two-dimensional kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x&lt;0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in magnetic samples with x=0.58, y=0.1 we report unusual in-plane ferromagnetic canting (FM) of the in-plane antiferromagnet (AFM), with an unusually wide regime of short-ranged order, and propose theoretical models to explain this behavior. First, we show that Kitaev type exchanges naturally arise on the kagome lattice to second order in the known Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges, and that these interactions can produce the unusual in-plane FM canting from antichiral AFM. Second, we propose a phenomenological model of weakly-FM-canted spin clusters to describe the short-ranged regime and analyze quantum fluctuations in an ABH toy model to show how ABH disorder can stabilize this regime. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that kagome-Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.</description>

Abstract: We report the study of phases and transitions of SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field on the triangular lattice. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton large-N mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moire superlattices and cold atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Dual-space cluster-diagrammatic approach to nonlocal electronic correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the dual triply irreducible local expansion (D-TRILEX) approach for correlated electronic systems by introducing a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the reliable Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem. We further compare this method with the more computationally demanding parquet dynamical vertex approximation and find that, our method yields substantially more accurate results at momenta associated with the Fermi surface. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose a computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</description>

      <title>Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, that combines ultrafast tunneling microscopy (USTM), ultrafast point-contact spectroscopy (UPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescale, all within a single instrument. Using this platform, we investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our UPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification, analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at proximate frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations in quantum materials and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov-fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $Z_2$ short-ranged Ans\"atze and analyze the phase diagram in the mean-field parameter space, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a semi-Dirac spin liquid that emerges at the level of projective symmetry group classification and mean-field band structure, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all symmetry-allowed mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Among these, we find four quasi-one-dimensional QSL phases, one dimer phase, and one Dirac QSL phase. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations and compare qualitative momentum-space features of these spectra with those obtained at the mean-field level. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for neutron-scattering studies.</description>

      <title>Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal NiTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide(TMD) NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, conflicting conclusions were reported regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study core-levels and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ Resonant-PES to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The Ni $3d$ on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states(DOS) and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge-transfer (CT) cluster model calculations using the experimental $U_{dd}$, and it shows that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative CT energy $\Delta$. A comparative analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated CT insulator character, with a larger $U_{dd}$ and positive $\Delta$. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$&lt;$NiO, and shows that $T_{eg}$ is not responsible for reducing $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO. The negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$ leads to the increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron. However, importantly, since $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$|\Delta|$, a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ results in pushing $d$-states away from Fermi level and this is required to make NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated Dirac semi-metal with band inversion in the $p$-$p$ type lowest energy excitations.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in a correlated topological metal CoTe$_2$</title>

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) CoTe$_2$ is a topological Dirac Type-II metal. However, the Co $3d$-bands in CoTe$_2$ do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO. We address this conundrum by studying the electronic structure of CoTe$_2$ using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant-PES. We quantify the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band Resonant-PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV for CoTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level Co $2p$ PES and $L$-edge XAS spectra of CoTe\textsubscript{2} and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe\textsubscript{2}, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe\textsubscript{2} is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$$p$ type lowest energy excitations. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in the correlated metal CoTe$_2$.</description>

Abstract: An extensive Monte Carlo study of the classical Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions $J_n$ between the first, second, and third neighbors is performed in a broad region of $J_2 / J_1$, $J_3 / J_1$ ratios, and temperature. The character of the phase transitions is analyzed via the Binder cumulant method. The Neel temperature $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and the frustration parameter (the ratio $f= |\theta|/T_{\mathrm{N}}$, $\theta$ being the Curie-Weiss temperature) are calculated. A comparison with the Tyablikov approximation is carried out. The strength of the frustration effects is explored. Possible applications to antiferromagnetic perovskites, such as CaMnO$_3$ and HgMnO$_3$, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exciton enhanced nonlinear optical responses in monolayer h-BN and MoS2: Insight from first-principles exciton-state coupling formalism and calculations</title>

Abstract: Excitons are vital in the photophysics of materials, especially in low-dimensional systems. The conceptual and quantitative understanding of excitonic effects in nonlinear optical (NLO) processes is more challenging compared to linear ones. Here, we present an ab initio approach to second-order NLO responses, incorporating excitonic effects, that employs an exciton-state coupling formalism and allows a detailed analysis of the role of individual excitonic states. Taking monolayer h-BN and MoS2 as two prototype 2D materials, we calculate their second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility and shift current conductivity tensor. We find strong excitonic enhancement requires that the resonant excitons are not only optically bright themselves, but also be able to couple strongly to other bright excitons. Our results explain the occurrence of two strong peaks in the SHG of monolayer h-BN and why the A and B excitons of MoS2 unexpectedly exhibit minimal excitonic enhancement in both SHG and shift current generation.</description>

      <title>Prediction of several Co-based La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-like superconducting materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity has been found in Fe-, Ni-, and Cu-based compounds but has remained elusive in Co-based materials. The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has renewed interest in related layered systems. Here, we predict several Co-based analogs that may realize similar physics. Electron doping of the high-pressure bilayer cobaltate La$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$ yields LaTh$_2$Co$_2$O$_7$, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$, and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Br$_2$, which exhibit closely related crystal structures and strongly correlated electronic states. Random-phase-approximation calculations reveal $s$-wave as the leading pairing symmetry in these compounds.</description>

      <title>Utility-Scale Quantum State Preparation: Classical Training using Pauli Path Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more -- sizes at which generic quantum circuits are beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation -- thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, for 0- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy and asymmetry of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields. In particular, we find a closed-form expression for the R\'enyi asymmetries of a compact scalar field on spherical subregions in three and four spacetime dimensions, and for higher-form gauge fields in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Spillover of High Magnetic Field-induced SC3 Superconductivity Outside the Spin-Polarized State in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our recent study of the high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$ [Phys. Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations.</description>
