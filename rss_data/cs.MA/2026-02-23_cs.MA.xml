      <title>Reasoning-Native Agentic Communication for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future 6G networks will interconnect not only devices, but autonomous machines that continuously sense, reason, and act. In such environments, communication can no longer be understood solely as delivering bits or even preserving semantic meaning. Even when two agents interpret the same information correctly, they may still behave inconsistently if their internal reasoning processes evolve differently. We refer to this emerging challenge as belief divergence. This article introduces reasoning native agentic communication, a new paradigm in which communication is explicitly designed to address belief divergence rather than merely transmitting representations. Instead of triggering transmissions based only on channel conditions or data relevance, the proposed framework activates communication according to predicted misalignment in agents internal belief states. We present a reasoning native architecture that augments the conventional communication stack with a coordination plane grounded in a shared knowledge structure and bounded belief modeling. Through enabling mechanisms and representative multi agent scenarios, we illustrate how such an approach can prevent coordination drift and maintain coherent behavior across heterogeneous systems. By reframing communication as a regulator of distributed reasoning, reasoning native agentic communication enables 6G networks to act as an active harmonizer of autonomous intelligence.</description>

      <title>MultiVer: Zero-Shot Multi-Agent Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MultiVer, a zero-shot multi-agent system for vulnerability detection that achieves state-of-the-art recall without fine-tuning. A four-agent ensemble (security, correctness, performance, style) with union voting achieves 82.7% recall on PyVul, exceeding fine-tuned GPT-3.5 (81.3%) by 1.4 percentage points -- the first zeroshot system to surpass fine-tuned performance on this benchmark. On SecurityEval, the same architecture achieves 91.7% detection rate, matching specialized systems. The recall improvement comes at a precision cost: 48.8% precision versus 63.9% for fine-tuned baselines, yielding 61.4% F1. Ablation experiments isolate component contributions: the multi-agent ensemble adds 17 percentage points recall over single-agent security analysis. These results demonstrate that for security applications where false negatives are costlier than false positives, zero-shot multi-agent ensembles can match and exceed fine-tuned models on the metric that matters most.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning without Synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field reinforcement learning (MF-RL) scales multi-agent RL to large populations by reducing each agent's dependence on others to a single summary statistic -- the mean action. However, this reduction requires every agent to act at every time step; when some agents are idle, the mean action is simply undefined. Addressing asynchrony therefore requires a different summary statistic -- one that remains defined regardless of which agents act. The population distribution $\mu \in \Delta(\mathcal{O})$ -- the fraction of agents at each observation -- satisfies this requirement: its dimension is independent of $N$, and under exchangeability it fully determines each agent's reward and transition. Existing MF-RL theory, however, is built on the mean action and does not extend to $\mu$. We therefore construct the Temporal Mean Field (TMF) framework around the population distribution $\mu$ from scratch, covering the full spectrum from fully synchronous to purely sequential decision-making within a single theory. We prove existence and uniqueness of TMF equilibria, establish an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ finite-population approximation bound that holds regardless of how many agents act per step, and prove convergence of a policy gradient algorithm (TMF-PG) to the unique equilibrium. Experiments on a resource selection game and a dynamic queueing game confirm that TMF-PG achieves near-identical performance whether one agent or all $N$ act per step, with approximation error decaying at the predicted $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ rate.</description>

      <title>Nested Training for Mutual Adaptation in Human-AI Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual adaptation is a central challenge in human--AI teaming, as humans naturally adjust their strategies in response to a robot's policy. Existing approaches aim to improve diversity in training partners to approximate human behavior, but these partners are static and fail to capture adaptive behavior of humans. Exposing robots to adaptive behaviors is critical, yet when both agents learn simultaneously in a multi-agent setting, they often converge to opaque implicit coordination strategies that only work with the agents they were co-trained with. Such agents fail to generalize when paired with new partners. In order to capture the adaptive behavior of humans, we model the human-robot teaming scenario as an Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), explicitly modeling human adaptation as part of the state. We propose a nested training regime to approximately learn the solution to a finite-level I-POMDP. In this framework, agents at each level are trained against adaptive agents from the level below. This ensures that the ego agent is exposed to adaptive behavior during training while avoiding the emergence of implicit coordination strategies, since the training partners are not themselves learning. We train our method in a multi-episode, required cooperation setup in the Overcooked domain, comparing it against several baseline agents designed for human-robot teaming. We evaluate the performance of our agent when paired with adaptive partners that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that our agent not only achieves higher task performance with these adaptive partners but also exhibits significantly greater adaptability during team interactions.</description>

      <title>El Agente Gr\'afico: Structured Execution Graphs for Scientific Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate scientific workflows, yet their integration with heterogeneous computational tools remains ad hoc and fragile. Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gr\'afico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates. Together, these results illustrate how abstraction and type safety can provide a scalable foundation for agentic scientific automation beyond prompt-centric designs.</description>
