      <title>When Less is More: Evolutionary Dynamics of Deception in a Sender-Receiver Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation poses a significant threat to societal well-being. We analyze this phenomenon using an evolutionary game theory model of the sender-receiver game, where senders aim to mislead receivers and receivers aim to discern the truth. Using a combination of replicator equations, finite-size scaling analysis, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the long-term evolutionary dynamics of this game. Our central finding is a counterintuitive threshold phenomenon: the role (sender or receiver) with the larger difference in payoffs between successful and unsuccessful interactions is surprisingly more likely to lose in the long run. We show that this effect is robust across different parameter values and arises from the interplay between the relative speeds of evolution of the two roles and the ability of the slower evolving role to exploit the fixed strategy of the faster evolving role. Moreover, for finite populations we find that the initially less frequent strategy of the slower role is more likely to fixate in the population. The initially rarer strategy in the less-rewarded role is, paradoxically, more likely to prevail.</description>

      <title>Shifting burdens: How delayed decarbonisation of road transport affects other sectoral emission reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022, fuel combustion in road transport accounted for approximately 21% (760 million tonnes) of CO2 emissions in the European Union (EU). Road transport is the only sector with rising emissions, with an increase of 24% compared to 1990. The EU initially aimed to ban new CO2-emitting cars by 2030 but has since delayed this target to 2035, underscoring the ongoing challenges in the push for rapid decarbonisation. The pace of decarbonisation in this sector will either ease or intensify the pressure on other sectors to stay within the EU's carbon budget. This paper explores the effects of speeding up or slowing down the transition in road transport. We reveal that a slower decarbonisation path not only drives up system costs by 126 billion Euro/a (6%) but also demands more than a doubling of the CO2 price from 137 to 290 Euro/tCO2 in 2030 to trigger decarbonisation in other sectors. On the flip side, accelerating the shift to cleaner transport proves to be the most cost-effective strategy, giving room for more gradual changes in the heating and industrial sectors, while reducing the reliance on carbon removal in later years. Earlier mandates than currently envisaged by the EU can avoid stranded assets and save up to 43 billion Euro/a compared to current policies.</description>

      <title>Higher-order shortest paths in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03020v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the defining features of complex networks is the connectivity properties that we observe emerging from local interactions. Recently, hypergraphs have emerged as a versatile tool to model networks with non-dyadic, higher-order interactions. Nevertheless, the connectivity properties of real-world hypergraphs remain largely understudied. In this work we introduce path size as a measure to characterise higher-order connectivity and quantify the relevance of non-dyadic ties for efficient shortest paths in a diverse set of empirical networks with and without temporal information. By comparing our results with simple randomised null models, our analysis presents a nuanced picture, suggesting that non-dyadic ties are often central and are vital for system connectivity, while dyadic edges remain essential to connect more peripheral nodes, an effect which is particularly pronounced for time-varying systems. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the structural organisation of systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Cooperation, satisfaction, and rationality in social games on complex networks with aspiration-driven players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A network model based on players' aspirations is proposed and analyzed theoretically and numerically within the framework of evolutionary game theory. In this model, players decide whether to cooperate or defect by comparing their payoffs from pairwise games with their neighbors, driven by a common aspiration level. The model also incorporates a degree of irrationality through an effective temperature in the Fermi function. The level of cooperation in the system is fundamentally influenced by two social attributes: satisfaction, defined as the fraction of players whose payoffs exceed the aspiration level, and the degree of rationality in decision-making. Rational players tend to maintain their initial strategies for sufficiently low aspiration levels, while irrational agents promote a state of perfect coexistence, resulting in half of the agents cooperating. The transition between these two behaviors can be critical, often leading to abrupt changes in cooperation levels. When the aspiration level is high, all players become dissatisfied, regardless of the effective temperature. Intermediate aspiration levels result in diverse behaviors, including sudden transitions for rational agents and a non-monotonic relationship between cooperation and increased irrationality. The study also carefully examines the effects of the interaction structure, initial conditions, and the strategy update rule (asynchronous versus synchronous). Special attention is given to the prisoner's dilemma, where significant cooperation levels can be achieved in a structured environment, with moderate aspiration and high rationality settings, and following a synchronous strategy updating scheme.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Behavior in Pre-State Societies: An Agent-Based Approach of the Axum Civilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates Charles Stanish's hypothesis, which posits that pre-state societies could achieve cooperative behavior without the presence of coercive authority. Using agent-based modeling applied to data inspired by the Axum civilization, we examine the dynamics of cooperation in the presence and absence of a Public Goods Game. Results show that while cooperative behavior can emerge in the short term without coercive power, it may not be sustainable over the long term, suggesting a need for centralized authority to foster stable, complex societies. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary pathways that lead to state formation and complex social structures.</description>

      <title>Cohesive urban bicycle infrastructure design through optimal transport routing in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bicycle infrastructure networks must meet the needs of cyclists to position cycling as a viable transportation choice in cities. In particular, protected infrastructure should be planned cohesively for the whole city and spacious enough to accommodate all cyclists safely and prevent cyclist congestion -- a common problem in cycling cities like Copenhagen. Here, we devise an adaptive method for optimal bicycle network design and for evaluating congestion criticalities on bicycle paths. The method goes beyond static network measures, using computationally efficient adaptation rules inspired by Optimal Transport on the dynamically updating multilayer network of roads and protected bicycle lanes. Street capacities and cyclist flows reciprocally control each other to optimally accommodate cyclists on streets with one control parameter that dictates the preference of bicycle infrastructure over roads. Applying our method to Copenhagen confirms that the city's bicycle network is generally well-developed. However, we are able to identify the network's bottlenecks, and we find, at a finer scale, disparities in network accessibility and criticalities between different neighborhoods. Our model and results are generalizable beyond this particular case study to serve as a scalable and versatile tool for aiding urban planners in designing cycling-friendly cities.</description>

      <title>Identifying robust features of community structure in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network science has presented community detection as a valuable tool for revealing functional modules in complex systems rooted in the wiring architectures of complex networks. The varying procedures of community detection can produce, however, divisions of a network into communities that vary considerably in structure but are deemed to be of similar merit. This is especially problematic when the network is constructed on uncertain data, since small changes to the network's configuration can cause radically different structure to be detected. To reconcile with the ambiguity in interpreting degenerate network partitions as representations of the underlying system function, we introduce a recursive significance clustering scheme that identifies the subsets of nodes having stable joint community assignments under network perturbation. These robust node groups are referred to here as cores, and represent well-supported features of network structure as distinct from the nodes with unstable community assignments. We show that cores characterize the variability inherent to non-overlapping community structure in networks and are cohesive under temporal evolution of the network.</description>

      <title>The Physics and Metaphysics of Social Powers: Bridging Cognitive Processing and Social Dynamics, a New Perspective on Power through Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of power can be explored at several scales: from physical action and process effectuation, all the way to complex social dynamics. A spectrum-wide analysis of power requires attention to the fundamental principles that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the acquisition and maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and cognitive processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents more information-processing capacities and opportunities, either by relying on others to bring about desired policies or ultimately outcomes, and/or by enjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of relying on others for the reproduction of (material) tasks. The effects of social empowerment thus imply an increased ability to harness computation toward desired ends, thereby augmenting the evolution of a specific state space. Empowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to increasing the scale of their access to various policies effectuating these state spaces. The presented argument posits that social power, in the context of active inference, is a function of several variables. As a result of its power-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers against possible vulnerabilities. We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by enhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively. This dual mechanism is argued to create a cyclical, reinforcing pattern wherein the empowered are able to incrementally expand the scope of policies and state spaces available to them while minimizing risk-exposure.</description>
