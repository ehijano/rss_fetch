      <title>Representation theory of the Reflection Equation Algebra II: Theory of shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of the representations of the Reflection Equation Algebra (=REA) on Hilbert spaces, focusing again on the REA constructed from the $R$-matrix associated to the standard $q$-deformation of $GL(N,\mathbb{C})$ for $0&lt;q&lt;1$. We consider the Poisson structure appearing as the classical limit of the $R$-matrix, and parametrize the symplectic leaves explicitly in terms of a type of matrix we call a shape matrix. We then introduce a quantized version of the shape matrix for the REA, and show that each irreducible representation of the REA has a unique shape.</description>

      <title>Monomial web basis for the SL(N) skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any non-zero complex number $q$, excluding finitely many roots of unity of small order, a linear basis for the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere is constructed. In particular, the skein algebra is a commutative polynomial algebra in $n-1$ generators, where each generator is represented by an explicit $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ web, without crossings, on the surface. This includes the case $q=1$, where the skein algebra is identified with the coordinate ring of the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ character variety of the twice punctured sphere. The proof of both the spanning and linear independence properties of the basis depends on the so-called $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ quantum trace map, due originally to Bonahon-Wong in the case $n=2$. A consequence of the proof is that the polynomial algebra sits as a distinguished subalgebra of the L\^{e}-Sikora $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ stated skein algebra of the annulus. We end by discussing the relationship with Fock-Goncharov duality.</description>

      <title>Vector bundles on quantum conjugacy classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple complex Lie algebra of a classical type and $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ the corresponding Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group at $q$ not a root of unity. With every point $t$ of the fixed maximal torus $T$ of an algebraic group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we associate an additive category $\mathcal{O}_q(t)$ of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules that is stable under tensor product with finite-dimensional quasi-classical $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules. We prove that $\mathcal{O}_q(t)$ is essentially semi-simple and use it to explicitly quantize equivariant vector bundles on the conjugacy class of $t$.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <title>A Gr\"obner Approach to Dual-Containing Cyclic Left Module $(\theta,\delta)$-Codes over Finite Commutative Frobenius Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a skew polynomial ring $R=A[X;\theta,\delta]$ where $A$ is a commutative Frobenius ring, $\theta$ an endomorphism of $A$ and $\delta$ a $\theta$-derivation of $A$, we consider cyclic left module codes $\mathcal{C}=Rg/Rf\subset R/Rf$ where $g$ is a left and right divisor of $f$ in $R$. In this paper, we derive a parity check matrix when $A$ is a finite commutative Frobenius ring using only the framework of skew polynomial rings. We consider rings $A=B[a_1,\ldots,a_s]$ which are free $B$-modules where the restriction of $\delta$ and $\theta$ to $B$ are polynomial maps. If a Gr\"obner basis can be computed over $B$, then we show that all Euclidean and Hermitian dual-containing codes $\mathcal{C}=Rg/Rf\subset R/Rf$ can be computed using a Gr\"obner basis. We also give an algorithm to test if the dual code is again a cyclic left module code. We illustrate our approach for rings of order $4$ with non-trivial endomorphism and the Galois ring of characteristic $4$.</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis deformations of Poisson algebras and $F$-manifold algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of pre-Poisson algebras was introduced by Aguiar in his study of zinbiel algebras and pre-Lie algebras. In this paper, we first introduce NS-Poisson algebras as a generalization of both Poisson algebras and pre-Poisson algebras. An NS-Poisson algebra has an associated sub-adjacent Poisson algebra. We show that a Nijenhuis operator and a twisted Rota-Baxter operator on a Poisson algebra deforms the structure into an NS-Poisson algebra. The semi-classical limit of an NS-algebra deformation and a suitable filtration of an NS-algebra produce NS-Poisson algebras. On the other hand, F-manifold algebras were introduced by Dotsenko as the underlying algebraic structure of F-manifolds. We also introduce NS-F-manifold algebras as a simultaneous generalization of NS-Poisson algebras, F-manifold algebras and pre-F-manifold algebras. In the end, we show that Nijenhuis deformations of F-manifold algebras and the semi-classical limits of NS-pre-Lie algebra deformations have NS-F-manifold algebra structures.</description>

Abstract: Using the braided version of Lawvere's algebraic theories and Mac Lane's PROPs, we introduce polynomial identities for arbitrary algebraic structures in a braided monoidal category C as well as their codimensions in the case when C is linear over some field. The new cases include coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, braided vector spaces, Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, etc. We find bases for polynomial identities and calculate codimensions in some important particular cases.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Deformation of the Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'{a}k Corner VOA and the Associated Partially Symmetric Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>
