      <title>Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks: Migration, Growth, and Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parameter survey of fragmentation in collapsar disks, using a revised version of the Chen &amp; Beloborodov (2007) model that determines the structure of steady state hyperaccretion disks in a general relativistic and neutrino cooled framework. We map out the range of disk conditions leading to gravitational instability alongside an exploration of the dimensionless cooling time $\beta$, which together determine whether fragmentation is likely to occur. We estimate the initial mass and density of fragments, finding that they occupy a unique region in the space of self-gravitating compact objects, with masses $M_{\rm f} \sim 10^{-3} M_\odot -10^{-1} M_\odot$ and densities $\rho_{\rm f}\sim 10^8-10^{11}~{\rm g~cm}^{-3}$. We then calculate their migration and mass growth (via Bondi-Hoyle accretion) as they inspiral through the collapsar disk. During a fragment's migration to the central black hole, it can grow its mass up to a range $M_{\rm f}\sim 10^{-1} M_\odot - 1 M_\odot$. In most cases, the final fragment mass is larger than the minimum cold stable neutron star mass but much smaller than any observed neutron star. The fragment briefly achieves peak accretion rates comparable to (or even larger than) that of the central engine. We propose that these bound fragments may give rise to observable astrophysical phenomena, and we approximately model two of these: (i) gamma ray burst variability produced by a secondary, fragment-launched jet; (ii) the generation of non-vacuum gravitational waveforms accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Detection of the Geminga pulsar at energies down to 20 GeV with the LST-1 of CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geminga is the third gamma-ray pulsar firmly detected by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) after the Crab and the Vela pulsars. Most of its emission is expected at tens of GeV, and, out of the planned telescopes of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) are the only ones with optimised sensitivity at these energies. We aim to characterise the gamma-ray pulse shape and spectrum of Geminga as observed by the first LST (hereafter LST-1) of the CTAO-North. Furthermore, this study confirms the great performance and the improved energy threshold of the telescope, as low as 10 GeV for pulsar analysis, with respect to current-generation Cherenkov telescopes. We analysed 60 hours of good-quality data taken by the LST-1 at zenith angles below 50$^\circ$. Additionally, a new Fermi-LAT analysis of 16.6 years of data was carried out to extend the spectral analysis down to 100 MeV. Lastly, a detailed study of the systematic effects was performed. We report the detection of Geminga in the energy range between 20 and 65 GeV. Of the two peaks of the phaseogram, the second one, P2, is detected with a significance of 12.2$\sigma$, while the first (P1) reaches a significance level of 2.6$\sigma$. The best-fit model for the spectrum of P2 was found to be a power law with $\Gamma = (4.5 \pm 0.4_{stat})^{+0.2_{sys}}_{-0.6_{sys}}$, compatible with the previous results obtained by the MAGIC. No evidence of curvature is found in the LST-1 energy range. The joint fit with Fermi data confirms a preference for a sub-exponential cut-off over a pure exponential, even though both models fail to reproduce the data above several tens of GeV. The overall results presented in this paper prove that the LST-1 is an excellent telescope for the observation of pulsars, and improved sensitivity is expected to be achieved with the full CTAO-North.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Constraining the EoS of Neutron Stars Using Post-Merger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\sim$1 km ( $\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations.</description>

      <title>Polytropic Wind-Driven Bubbles and their Shock Structures in Radially Stratified Ambient Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the analytic expressions for polytropic wind-driven bubbles and their shock structures, formulated initially in Koo and McKee 1992(a,b), focusing on spherically symmetric configurations in astrophysical environments with $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, which arises naturally in the star-forming environment and has applications to winds flowing into a preexisting bubble. Wind luminosity is assumed to be constant, and as a result the shock velocities of these bubbles are constant in time. The ratio of specific heats is assumed to be the same in the shocked ambient medium and the shocked wind. Numerical results are presented for one selected ratio of wind density to ambient density. Exact ODEs are written for the compressed wind region and approximate solutions are found by fitting the ODE solutions. By analyzing the interactions between stellar winds and ambient media in the strong compression limit, we model the formation and evolution of spherical bubbles, highlighting their shock fronts and contact discontinuities. Our analytic method provides an intuitive approach to calculating the thickness of bubble shells, which is crucial for understanding their dynamics and observational characteristics. A numerical method explores conditions without explicitly requiring the strong compression limit, and then we compare numerical to analytical results under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, UHECR, are charged particles with energies between $\sim10^{18}\,{\rm eV}$ and $\sim3\times10^{20}\,{\rm eV}\sim50\,{\rm J}$. They exhibit fundamental physics at energies inaccessible to terrestrial accelerators, challenge experimental physics and connect strongly to astronomical observations through electromagnetic, neutrino and even gravitational wave channels. There has been much theoretical and observational progress in the sixty years that have elapsed since the discovery of UHECR, to divine their nature and identify their sources. The highest energy UHECR appear to be heavy nuclei with rigidity extending up to $\sim10\,{\rm EV}$; A significant ($6.9\sigma$) dipole anisotropy has been measured but our poor understanding of the Galactic magnetic fields makes this hard to interpret; The UHECR luminosity density is $\sim 10^{44}$ erg Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ which constrains explanations of their origin; The most promising acceleration mechanisms involve diffusive shock acceleration and unipolar induction; The most promising sources include intergalactic accretion shocks, and relativistic jets from stellar-mass or supermassive black holes. We explore the prospects for using the highest energy events, combined with multimessenger astronomy, to help us solve the riddle of UHECR.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Accretion disc/Corona Connection in NGC 6814: Insights from UV and X-ray spectral-timing studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of NGC 6814 using AstroSat's 2019 and XMM-Newton's 2021 observations. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between FUV (1541 \AA)/X-ray and UVW1 (2910 \AA)/X-ray variations, with delays of $\sim 15~\rm{ks}$ and $30~\rm{ks}$, respectively. We constructed four broadband SEDs after applying aperture correction (for the UVIT filter), subtracting host galaxy and emission line contributions from UV flux, and using mean X-ray spectra alongside selected UV data points. First, we fitted the SEDs with KYNSED model assuming various combinations of inclination, $\theta$, color correction factors, $f_{\rm col}$, and BH spins. Best-fit models were achieved for $\theta=70^{\circ}$ (consistent with past estimates for this source) and for spin $\leq 0.5$, while $f_{\rm col}$ is not constrained. KYNSED provided satisfactory fit to all SEDs in the case when the corona is powered by the accretion process, with $\sim 10-20$% of the accretion power transferred to the corona, $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.1$, corona radius of $\sim 6-10~r_g$, and height of $\sim7.5-35~r_g$. Model time-lags computed using the SED best-fit results are aligned well with the observed time-lags. Although some of the model parameters are not constrained, the important result of our work is that both the broadband X-ray/UV spectra and the X-ray/UV time-lags in NGC 6814 are consistent with the hypothesis of X-ray illumination of the disc in a lamp-post geometry framework. Within this model framework, we do not need to assume an outer or inner truncated disc.</description>

      <title>The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than $10$ Myr follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of $\ln\left(v/\text{km}/\text{s}^{-1}\right)=5.60\pm0.12$ and a standard deviation of $0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}150$--$200$ km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below $40$ Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with mean and standard deviation of $5.67\pm0.10$ and $0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.</description>

      <title>Reflection Spectra of Accretion Disks Illuminated by an Off-Axis Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic reflection features in the X-ray spectra of accreting black holes are considered to be generated by the illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona. In this work, we present a numerical method for the emission line profile and the reflection spectrum produced by an off-axis X-ray source. The X-ray source is considered as a point source, as in the lamppost scenario, except that it is located off-axis and moves at arbitrary velocity. The observed flux for the distant observer is calculated directly without priority evaluation of the emissivity on the accretion disk, which allows our model to be applicable to the point source that deviates from the axis of the black hole spins and moves with a velocity. To study the impact of the off-axis geometry on the measurement of source properties, we simulate observations for a black hole binary with NuSTAR and eXTP. We compare the simulation with the observation of the phase-resolved spectra of the low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillation observed by the Insight Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope. Due to the nonaxisymmetric illumination on the accretion disk, parameters of the model are not reproduced by the lamppost model, including the corona height, radial velocity, and the reflection fraction. On the other hand, all the model parameters are recovered through the off-axis model.</description>

      <title>Connecting the m-dots: accretion rates and thermonuclear burst recurrence times on neutron stars and white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compilation of observed recurrence times ($t_{\rm rec}$) and infer the corresponding local mass-accretion rates ($\dot m$) for type I X-ray bursts, milliHertz quasi-periodic oscillating sources and recurrent novae eruptions. We construct models of the $t_{\rm rec}-\dot m$ relation for accreting white dwarfs and neutron stars and find that both are roughly consistent with a global inverse linear relation, connecting for the first time thermonuclear runaways on neutron stars and white dwarfs. We find that theoretical models of pure He bursts are in agreement with the best $t_{\rm rec}$ measurements in ultra-compact X-ray binaries at low $\dot m$ (4U~$0614+09$ and 2S~0918-549).
  We suggest that the transient Z source XTE~J1701-462 is a slow rotator, based on its mHz QPO properties. Finally, we discuss the implications for thermonuclear ignition and point out that the difference in eruption/burst energy ($E_{b_{WD}}/E_{b_{NS}}=2\times 10^4$) is consistent with the difference in area between neutron stars and white dwarfs $\left((R_{WD}/R_{NS})^2=4\times 10^4\right)$. We conclude that ignitions of thermonuclear shell flashes on neutron stars and white dwarfs depend primarily on the specific mass accretion rate and do not depend on the nature of the underlying compact object.</description>

      <title>Updated predictions for gravitational wave emission from TDEs for next generation observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) emission from stars tidally disrupted by black holes (TDEs), using a semi-analytical approach. Contrary to previous works where this signal is modeled as a monochromatic burst, we here take into account all its harmonic components. On top of this, we also extend the analysis to a population of repeated-partial TDEs, where the star undergoes multiple passages around the black hole before complete disruption. For both populations, we estimate the rate of individual GW-detections considering future observatories like LISA and a potential deci-Hertz (dHz) mission, and derive the GW background from these sources. Our conclusions, even if more conservative, are consistent with previous results presented in literature. In fact, full disruptions of stars will not be seen by LISA but will be important targets for dHz observatories. In contrast, GWs from repeated disruptions will not be detectable in the near future.</description>

      <title>Revisiting GW150914 with a non-planar, eccentric waveform model</title>

Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration, GW150914, marked the start of a new exciting era in astronomy, enabling the study of the Universe through a new messenger. Since then, the field has grown rapidly, with the development of increasingly more sophisticated techniques to detect, analyze and interpret the signals. In this paper we revisit GW150914, presenting updated estimates of its source parameters using a waveform model developed within the EOB formalism, able to describe gravitational-wave emission from generic non-circular, non-planar binaries. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the signal and its properties, considering and contrasting various scenarios for the source: from the simplest, aligned-spin quasi-circular binary black hole merger, to more complex scenarios, including precession, eccentricity or both. Unsurprisingly, we find that the signal is consistent with a quasi-circular ($e &lt; 0.08$ at $15$ Hz), slowly spinning $(\chi_{\rm eff} = -0.03^{+0.12}_{-0.13})$ binary black hole merger, a-posteriori validating a considerable body of works. This is the first analysis performed with an inspiral-merger-ringdown model containing both eccentricity and precession.</description>

      <title>First IFU observations of two GRB host galaxies at cosmic noon with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of distant galaxies. Their luminous afterglow pinpoints galaxies independent of luminosity, in contrast to most flux-limited surveys. Nevertheless, GRB-selected galaxy samples are not free from bias, instead tracing the conditions favoured by the progenitor stars. Characterising the galaxy populations traced by GRBs is therefore important both to effectively use GRBs as probes as well as to place stronger constraints on the progenitor stars capable of forming long GRBs. Spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with integral field units (IFUs) provide valuable insights into the interstellar medium and stellar populations of GRB host galaxies. In this paper we present results of the first two GRB host galaxies observed with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU with a spatial resolution of ~ 1.6 kpc; the hosts of GRB 150403A and GRB 050820A at redshifts z ~ 2.06 and z ~ 2.61, respectively. The data reveal two complex galaxy environments made up of two or more star forming galaxies that are likely interacting given their small spatial separation (&lt; 20 kpc) and line of sight velocity offsets (&lt; 100 km/s). The measured gas-phase metallicity, star formation rates (SFRs), and key diagnostic line ratios for each of the detected galaxies are overall consistent with the properties of other star forming galaxies and GRB hosts at z &gt; 2. However, differences in the SFR and metallicities of the interacting galaxies highlight the importance of spatially resolved observations in order to accurately characterise the galaxy properties traced by GRBs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability and Dynamics of Supersonic Compressible Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of shear layer instability in compressible flows is key to understanding phenomena from aerodynamics to astrophysical jets. Blumen's seminal paper [``Shear layer instability of an inviscid compressible fluid," J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 40}, 769--781 (1970)] established a linear stability framework for inviscid compressible shear flows, emphasizing velocity gradients and compressibility effects. However, the nonlinear regime remains insufficiently explored. This research extends Blumen's framework by conducting a weakly nonlinear stability analysis using the method of multiple scales to derive amplitude equations, such as the Landau-Stuart and complex Landau equations. Perturbation variables are expanded in a power series to capture amplitude evolution beyond linear theory. Finite boundary conditions are incorporated to enhance physical applicability. The study analyzes how compressibility and Mach number influence nonlinear saturation, revealing Mach-dependent bifurcations in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) with alternating stable and unstable regimes. Phase portraits and trajectories illustrate transitions, saturation, and spiral decay, which are relevant to astrophysical shear flows. Bifurcation analysis reveals both supercritical and subcritical Hopf behavior in compressible shear flows, underscoring the importance of nonlinear effects in the onset and evolution of flow instabilities. Qualitative and quantitative results of instability evolution have been shown from nonlinear stability analysis. This work bridges the critical gap between linear and fully nonlinear stability analyses by offering a systematic weakly nonlinear framework and the nonlinear dynamics for compressible shear layers. It generalizes the earlier linear results and provides new predictions about bifurcation behavior and long-time state selection in compressible flows.</description>

      <title>IceCube PeV neutrinos from heavy dark matter decay with 12 years HESE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of superheavy dark matter from the early universe may undergo decay via QCD cascades and electroweak cascade to produce neutrinos as one of the decay products. We consider the neutrino events in and around PeV region reported by IceCube collaboration are due to the decay of such heavy dark matter. The neutrino spectrum could be from the decay processes via hadronic decay modes and/or leptonic decay modes. Using the numerical evolution of QCD cascades as well as electroweak corrections where use has been made of DGLAP equations, the neutrino fluxes from the heavy dark matter decay have been computed. The mass of the decaying superheavy dark matter and its decay lifetime have then been estimated from a $\chi^2$ analysis of the IceCube 12-year data. The fractional contribution ($f_{\rm lep}$) of the leptonic decay channel in such a decay process is also estimated from the same $\chi^2$ analyses. It is seen that to explain the IceCube 12-year ultrahigh energy (UHE) events the mass of a decaying superheavy dark matter would be $\sim9.4\times 10^6$ GeV and decay time $\tau \simeq 4.2 \times 10^{28}$ second. It is also found that the lepton channel contribution is very small, $f_{\rm lep} \sim 0.001$.</description>

      <title>Mass-feeding of jet-launching white dwarfs in grazing and common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a scenario that allows white dwarfs (WDs) to launch relatively powerful jets when they enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) or experience a grazing envelope evolution (GEE) with a red giant branch star (RGB) or an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. In this, still a speculative scenario, the accretion for a time is mainly onto an accretion disk with a radius of ~ 1Ro that increases in mass. The accretion disk launches the powerful two opposite jets by releasing gravitational energy, up to several times super-Eddington, as its mass increases. The jets that the disk launches remove high-entropy gas from the disk's outskirts and the envelope that the WD inflates because of nuclear burning on its surface. The motivations to allow WDs to launch powerful jets are recent findings, from the morphologies of post-CEE planetary nebulae, that jets play a major role in the CEE and the accumulating evidence that jets power luminous red novae by jets, as their morphologies indicate. I strengthen my call to include jets in the simulation and modeling of the CEE, consider the GEE as a phase preceding the CEE in many (but not all) cases, and include jets as a major ingredient in modeling and stimulating all energetic luminous red novae.</description>

      <title>Galactic transient sources with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide variety of Galactic sources show transient emission at soft and hard X-ray energies: low- and high-mass X-ray binaries containing compact objects, isolated neutron stars exhibiting extreme variability as magnetars as well as pulsar-wind nebulae. Although most of them can show emission up to MeV and/or GeV energies, many have not yet been detected in the TeV domain by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting new Galactic transients with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and the prospects for studying them with Target of Opportunity observations. We show that CTAO will likely detect new sources in the TeV regime, such as the massive microquasars in the Cygnus region, low-mass X-ray binaries with low-viewing angle, flaring emission from the Crab pulsar-wind nebula or other novae explosions, among others. Since some of these sources could also exhibit emission at larger time-scales, we additionally test their detectability at longer exposures. We finally discuss the multiwavelength synergies with other instruments and large astronomical facilities.</description>

Abstract: We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <title>Dark matter admixed neutron stars with a realistic nuclear equation of state from chiral nuclear interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and other stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions at zero temperature and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling. Finally we study the stability of dark matter admixed neutron stars with respect to radial perturbations.</description>

      <title>A multi-dimensional view of a unified model for TDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can generate non-spherical, relativistic and optically thick outflows. Simulations show that the radiation we observe is reprocessed by these outflows. According to a unified model suggested by these simulations, the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of TDEs depend strongly on viewing angle: low [high] optical-to-X-ray ratios (OXRs) correspond to face-on [edge-on] orientations. Post-processing with radiative transfer codes have simulated the emergent spectra, but have so far been carried out only in a quasi-1D framework, with three atomic species (H, He and O). Here, we present 2.5D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations which model the emission from a non-spherical outflow, including a more comprehensive set of cosmically abundant species. While the basic trend of OXR increasing with inclination is preserved, the inherently multi-dimensional nature of photon transport through the non-spherical outflow significantly affects the emergent SEDs. Relaxing the quasi-1D approximation allows photons to preferentially escape in (polar) directions of lower optical depth, resulting in a greater variation of bolometric luminosity as a function of inclination. According to our simulations, inclination alone may not fully explain the large dynamic range of observed TDE OXRs. We also find that including metals, other than Oxygen, changes the emergent spectra significantly, resulting in stronger absorption and emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet, as well a greater variation in the OXR as a function of inclination. Whilst our results support previously proposed unified models for TDEs, they also highlight the critical importance of multi-dimensional ionization and radiative transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are the most numerous gravitational-wave sources observed to date. Their properties make them suitable for observation both by ground- and space-based detectors. Starting from synthetic catalogues constructed based on observational constraints from ground-based detectors, we explore the detection rates and the characteristic parameters of the stellar-mass black-hole binaries observable by LISA during their inspiral, using signal-to-noise ratio thresholds as a detection criterion. We find that only a handful of these sources will be detectable with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 8: about 5 sources on average in 4 years of mission duration, among which only one or two are multiband ones (i.e. merging in less than 15 years). We find that detectable sources have chirp mass $10 M_\odot&lt;M_c&lt;100 M_\odot$, residual time-to-coalescence $4yr&lt;t_c&lt;100yr$, and redshift $z&lt;0.1$, much closer than those observed up to now by ground-based detectors. We also explore correlations between the number of LISA detectable sources and the parameters of the population, suggesting that a joint measurement with the stochastic signal might be informative of the population characteristics. By performing parameter estimation on a subset of sources from the catalogues, we conclude that, even if LISA measurements will not be directly informative on the population due to the low number of resolvable sources, it will characterise a few, low-redshift candidates with great precision. Furthermore, we construct for the first time the LISA waterfall plot for low chirp-mass systems, as a function of their time to coalescence and inclination. We demonstrate that LISA will also be able to discriminate and characterize, through very precise parameter estimation, a population of binaries with higher masses, $M_c\sim O(10^3)M_\odot$, at the boundary of ground-based detectors sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Seeking the nearest neutron stars using a new local electron density map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a compelling testing ground for gravity, nuclear dynamics, and physics beyond the Standard Model, and so it will be useful to locate the neutron stars nearest to Earth. To that end, we revisit pulsar distance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves scattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map for the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest pulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale. This ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously estimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which motivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near candidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for testing fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron star heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We illustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter capture.</description>

Abstract: I find that the accretion disk around the neutron star (NS) that enters the core of a massive evolved star in the frame of the common-envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can penetrate the crust of the NS, mix neutron-rich crust material into the disk, and enrich the jets that the disk launches with the neutron-rich material. As the NS accretes at high rates from the core inside which it revolves, it forms an accretion disk with high density. In the CEJSN r-process scenario, the very high density in the accretion disk results in low electron fraction gas, enabling the r-process. Jets carry the r-process elements out. The new claim in this study is that the high-density accretion disk destroys part of the NS crust and entrains this mass. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mixes material from the deeper crust. The total neutron-rich mass that the disk mixes and the jets carry can be up to ~0.01Mo. Enriching the accretion disk with neutron-rich material ensures a low electron fraction as required by the r-process nucleosynthesis and the ejection of massive r-process ejecta, 0.01-0.03Mo. I strengthen the CEJSN r-process scenario, but do not claim it is the main r-process site. I only claim that two or more r-process sites contribute to r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Future of Soft X-ray Polarimetry: the Capabilities of the REDSoX Instrument for XDINS and Magnetar Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry offers a unique window into neutron star physics and can provide answers to questions that cannot otherwise be probed. The up-and-coming REDSoX sounding rocket mission will be the first experiment equipped with a detector able to explore polarized X-rays below 1 keV, observing in the 0.2-0.4 keV range. Although REDSoX will only be capable of short, one-off observations, it will crucially test the instrument performance. In this paper we investigate how a fully-fledged orbital mission with longer lifetime, based on an instrument design similar to REDSoX, will allow us to study thermal emission from the X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) and magnetars, probing their magnetic field and the physics of their outer surface layers, including vacuum effects and QED mode conversion at the vacuum resonance. We discuss the potentially observable features for promising values of the star's surface temperature, magnetic field, and viewing geometry. Assuming emission from the whole surface, we find that, for a source with a magnetic field B=5x10^{13} G and surface temperature T~10^7 K, the instrument can resolve a proton-cyclotron absorption feature in the spectrum with high significance when collecting ~25,000 counts across a single observation. Similarly, for a source with B=10^{14} G and T~10^7 K, a switch in the dominant polarization mode, caused by mode conversion at the vacuum resonance, can be detected by collecting ~25,000 counts, allowing for a long-sought observational test of the presence of QED effects. We then present two case studies for XDINS targets: RX J1856.5-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to optimizing the image cleaning performance of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes: Application to a time-based cleaning for H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a time-based cleaning method for H.E.S.S. using CT5 in monoscopic mode and presents an optimization workflow for image-cleaning algorithms to enhance telescope sensitivity while minimizing systematic biases. We evaluate three methods - tail-cut cleaning and two flavours of time-based cleaning TIME3D and TIME4D - and find best-cut configurations for two cases: optimal overall sensitivity and minimal energy threshold. TIME3D achieves a $\sim 15\%$ improvement with regard to the standard tail-cut cleaning for $E &lt; 300$ GeV, with a $\sim 200\%$ improvement for the first energy bin (36.5 GeV &lt; E &lt; 64.9 GeV), providing a more stable performance across a wider energy range by preserving more signal. TIME4D achieves a $\sim 20\%$ improvement at low energies due to superior NSB noise suppression, allowing for an enhanced capability of detecting sources at the lowest energies. We demonstrate that using first-order estimations of the performance of a cleaning, such as image size retaining or NSB pixel reduction, cannot provide a full picture of the expected result in the final sensitivity. Beyond expanding the effective area at low energies, sensitivity improvement requires precise event reconstruction, including improved energy and directional accuracy. Enhanced gamma-hadron separation and optimized pre-selection cuts further boost sensitivity. The proposed pipeline fully explores this, providing a fair and robust comparison between different cleaning methods. The method is general and can be applied to other IACT systems like VERITAS, MAGIC. By advancing data-driven image cleaning, this work lays the groundwork for detecting faint astrophysical sources and deepening our understanding of high-energy cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Thermonuclear superburst of MAXI J1752$-$457 observed with NinjaSat and MAXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An uncatalogued bright X-ray transient was detected with MAXI on November 9, 2024, named MAXI J1752$-$457. The NinjaSat X-ray observatory promptly observed the source from November 10 to 18 while the small angular separation from the Sun hampered follow-up campaigns by other X-ray observatories. The MAXI and NinjaSat light curves in the 2-10 keV band showed first and second decaying components at the early and late phases, approximated by exponential functions with e-folding constants of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.2 and 14.9 $\pm$ 0.9 hours (1$\sigma$ errors), respectively. A single blackbody model reproduces the X-ray spectrum with a softening trend of its temperature decreasing from 1.8 $\pm$ 0.1 keV to 0.59 $\pm$ 0.06 keV. Assuming the unknown source distance at 8 kpc, at which the initial X-ray luminosity roughly corresponds to the Eddington limit, the shrinking blackbody radius was estimated at 5-11 km. This X-ray brightening is interpreted as a superburst in a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary, which is powered by thermonuclear burning triggered presumably by carbon ignition close to the outer crust of the neutron star. The transition between two decaying components occurred at 5.5-7.7 hours, corresponding to the thermal time scale of the burning layer. The ignition column density is estimated to be (2.8-5.1)$\times 10^{12}$ g cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>GReX: An Instrument Overview and New Upper Limits on the Galactic FRB Population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the instrument design and initial results for the Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX), an all-sky monitor for exceptionally bright transients in the radio sky. This instrument builds on the success of STARE2 to search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the Milky Way and its satellites. This instrument has deployments across the globe, with wide sky coverage and searching down to $32\,\mu\text{s}$ time resolution, enabling the discovery of new super giant pulses. Presented here are the details of the hardware and software design of the instrument, performance in sensitivity and other key metrics, and experience in building a global-scale, low-cost experiment. We follow this discussion with experimental results on validation of the sensitivity via hydrogen-line measurements. We then update the rate of Galactic FRBs based on non-detection in the time since FRB 200428. Our results suggest FRB-like events are even rarer than initially implied by the detection of a MJy burst from SGR J1935+2154 in April 2020.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron Circular Polarization in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Optical Emission: Relativistic Thermal Electron Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron circular polarization of a non-thermal power-law electron distribution in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been studied. However, some numerical simulations have shown that the resulting distribution of electrons is a combination of a thermal component and a non-thermal power-law component. In this paper, we investigate synchrotron circular polarization using such a hybrid energy distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons within a globally toroidal magnetic field in GRB prompt optical emission. Our results show that compared to the solely nonthermal electron model, the synchrotron circular polarization degree (PD) in the hybrid electron model can vary widely in the optical band, depending on different parameters. The lower the electron temperature, the higher the circular PD. The time-averaged circular PD in the hybrid electron model can be higher than $\sim 1\%$ when the electron temperature is as low as $\sim 10^{10}$ K, while in the solely nonthermal electron model is usually lower than $\sim 1\%$. We further calculate the radiative transfer of the circular and linear polarization in the optical band. Our results show that both of the circular and linear PDs decrease with the increase of optical depth, but the linear PDs decline faster than the circular PDs. To further examine the physical mechanisms of both radiation and particle acceleration, we expect that instruments will be capable of measuring the circular polarization of GRB prompt optical emission in the future.</description>

      <title>A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel analytic density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the isothermal-core configuration, i.e. where both the density and velocity dispersion profiles exhibit central plateaus in the halo innermost region. Importantly, the profile retains a simple and tractable functional form. We demonstrate analytically how our density profile satisfies the aforementioned conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We further validate the profile using idealized N-body simulations, showing that it provides excellent representations of both the density and velocity dispersion profiles across a broad range of evolutionary stages, from the early thermalization phase to the late core-collapse regime. As a result of its accuracy and simplicity, the proposed profile offers a robust framework for analyzing halo evolution in a variety of SIDM scenarios. It also holds practical utility in reducing simulation needs and in generating initial conditions for simulations targeting the deep core-collapse regime.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Feedback in Massive Halos: Implications for the Distribution of Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use order of magnitude estimates and observational constraints to argue that feedback from relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) produced by massive black holes is likely to have a particularly large effect at radii of order the virial radius and larger in group-mass halos. We show that for a range of plausible (but uncertain) CR transport parameters and energetics, the pressure produced by CRs generated by the central massive black hole over its lifetime can be of order the thermal gas pressure in the outskirts of $\sim 10^{13-14} M_\odot$ halos (but not in more massive clusters). The properties of this CR feedback at low redshift are not well predicted by the radiative cooling rate of hot gas at smaller radii, which is often used as a proxy for `current' black hole feedback. This is because most black hole growth happens early in massive halos, and CR transport timescales in halo outskirts are Gyr or more; the accumulated CR energy thus depends on the full history of black hole activity in the halo. The large CR pressure in group-mass systems likely leads to CR-driven outflows that move gas from large halo radii to outside the virial radius. Such feedback would not be captured by current cosmological simulations that focus on mechanical black hole feedback; in particular, CR feedback remains active even long after the mechanical feedback sourcing the CRs has turned off. We speculate that this CR feedback may be important for explaining the weak lensing $S_8$ tension and the evidence for strong feedback at large halo radii from kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements. Prospects for testing this mechanism observationally and implementing the necessary physics in cosmological simulations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tidal response of regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs). Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations, interpreting the latter within the framework of Einstein's field equations in the presence of an appropriate exotic matter distribution. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. The results obtained for test fields and gravitational perturbations are in qualitative agreement. This hints at the possibility that similar conclusions could hold if these spacetimes were interpreted as solutions of a modified gravitational action. Our findings suggest that RBHs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only measurements with symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron-star inspirals carry information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not radii, which are measured by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars. To improve the multi-messenger astronomy studies of neutron stars, an expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be advantageous, as it would allow to compare information from two different channels. In order to do so, a symbolic regression method, pySR, is trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input to discover an approximate symbolic expression for the neutron-star radius as a function of gravitational-wave measurements only. The approximation is tested on piecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on selected realistic (non-polytropic) dense-matter theory EOSs, achieving consistent agreement between the ground truth values and the symbolic approximation for a broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations, with average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the approximation is applied to the GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal deformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius distributions.</description>

      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D -- Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>
