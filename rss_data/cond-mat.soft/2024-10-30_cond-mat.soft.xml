      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Classical theory of nucleation applied to condensation of a Lennard-Jones fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical nucleation theory (CNT) and its modified versions provide a convenient framework for describing the nucleation process under the capillary approximation. However, these models often predict nucleation rates that depart significantly from simulation results, even for a simple Lennard-Jones fluid. This large discrepancy is likely due to the inaccurate estimation of the driving force for nucleation, which most traditional models estimate within the ideal solution approximation. In this study, we address this issue by directly calculating the driving force for nucleation using equations of state (EOS) and integrating this approach into the calculation of nucleation rates within the framework of CNT and its modified model. We apply this method to examine the condensation of a Lennard-Jones fluid and compare the resulting nucleation rates with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Our results demonstrate that at relatively low supersaturation, where the capillary approximation is reasonable, our thermodynamic models exhibit excellent agreement with MD results, significantly outperforming traditional models. At moderate and high supersaturation, our approach continues to show a reasonable agreement with MD results. Furthermore, when comparing the results obtained by using different EOS, we find that more precise EOS generally yield better agreement with MD data.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly and non-equilibrium phase coexistence in a binary granular mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of a square crystalline phase in a vibrated binary mixture of spherical grains. This structure spontaneously forms from a disordered state, consistently with predictions obtained in an equilibrium system with similar geometrical properties under conservative dynamics. By varying the area fraction, we also observe stable coexistence between a granular fluid and an isolated square crystal. Using realistic simulations based on the discrete element method and an idealized collisional model integrated via event-driven molecular dynamics, we not only reproduce experimental results but also help to gain further insights into the non-equilibrium phase coexistence. Through the direct phase coexistence method, we demonstrate that the system shows behavior highly similar to an equilibrium first-order phase transition. However, the crystal remains at a higher granular temperature than the fluid, which is a striking non-equilibrium effect. Through qualitative argument and supported by kinetic theory, we elucidate the role of the coupling between local structure and energy transfer mechanisms in sustaining kinetic temperature gradients across the fluid-solid interface.</description>

      <title>Condensation and activator/repressor control of a transcription-regulated biomolecular liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells operate in part by compartmentalizing chemical reactions. For example, recent work has shown that chromatin, the material that contains the cell's genome, can auto-regulate its structure by utilizing reaction products (proteins, RNA) to compartmentalize biomolecules via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Here, we develop a model biomolecular system that permits quantitative investigation of such dynamics, particularly by coupling a phase-separating system of DNA nanostars to an in vitro transcription reaction. The DNA nanostars' sequence is designed such that they self-assemble into liquid droplets only in the presence of a transcribed single-stranded RNA linker. We find that nanostar droplets form with a substantial delay and non-linear response to the kinetics of RNA synthesis. In addition, we utilize the compartments generated by the phase-separation process to engineer an activator/repressor network, where the transcription reaction activates the formation of droplets, and then droplets suppress the transcription reaction by segregating transcription components inside them. Our work on transcription-driven liquid-liquid phase separation constitutes a robust and programmable platform to explore non-equilibrium reaction-phase transition dynamics and could also provide a foundation to understand the dynamics of transcriptional condensate assembly in cells.</description>

      <title>Mixing order asymmetry in nanoparticle-polymer complexation and precipitation revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in complex coacervation, driven by concerted efforts to offer novel experimental and theoretical insights into electrostatic charge-induced association. While previous studies have primarily focused on polyelectrolytes, proteins or surfactants, our work explores the potential of using cerium (CeO2) and iron ({\gamma}-Fe2O3) oxide nanoparticles (NPs) to develop innovative nanomaterials. By combining various charged species, such as polyelectrolytes, charged neutral block copolymers and coated NPs, we study a wide variety of complexation patterns and compare them using isothermal titration calorimetry, light scattering and microscopy. These techniques confirm that the titration of oppositely charged species occurs in two steps: the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes and subsequent phase (or microphase) separation, depending on the system studied. Across all examined cases, the entropic contribution to the total free energy surpasses the enthalpic contribution, in agreement with counterion release mechanisms. Furthermore, our investigation reveals a consistent asymmetry in the reaction enthalpy associated with the secondary process, with exothermic profiles observed upon the addition of cationic species to anionic ones and endothermic profiles in the reverse case.</description>

      <title>Size-dependency and lattice-discreetness effect on fracture toughness in 2D crystals under antiplanar loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracture toughness is the material property characterizing resistance to failure. Predicting its value from the solid structure at the atomistic scale remains elusive, even in the simplest situations of brittle fracture. We report here numerical simulations of crack propagation in two-dimensional fuse networks of different periodic geometries, which are electrical analogs of bidimensional brittle crystals under antiplanar loading. Fracture energy is determined from Griffith's analysis of energy balance during crack propagation, and fracture toughness is determined from fits of the displacement fields with Williams' asymptotic solutions. Significant size dependencies are evidenced in small lattices, with fracture energy and fracture toughness both converging algebraically with system size toward well-defined material-constant values in the limit of infinite system size. The convergence speed depends on the loading conditions and is faster when the symmetry of the considered lattice increases. The material constants at infinity obey Irwin's relation and properly define the material resistance to failure. Their values are approached up to $\sim$ 15 % using the recent analytical method proposed in Nguyen and Bonamy (Phys Rev Lett 123:205503, 2019). Nevertheless, the deviation remains finite and does not vanish when the system size goes to infinity. We finally show that this deviation is a consequence of the lattice discreetness and decreases when the super-singular terms of Williams' solutions (absent in a continuum medium but present here due to lattice discreetness) are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Understanding Interfacial Ice Premelting: Structure, Adhesion and Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic computer simulation study of ice premelting, and explore the thickness and structure of quasi-liquid layers formed at the interface of ice with substrates of different hydrophilicity. Our study shows that interfacial premelting occurs on neutral substrates of whatever hydrophilicity, forming films of limited thickness for substrates with contact angles larger than ca. 50$^\circ$ but exhibiting complete interfacial premelting at smaller contact angles. Contrary to most experimental studies, we focus not only on the premelting behavior with temperature, but also with pressure, which is a matter of relevance in important situations such as ice friction. Our study is guided within a rigorous framework of surface thermodynamics, demonstrating that the premelting film structure is a function of a single thermodynamic variable. By this token we are able to relate properties measured along an isobar, with premelting films at arbitrary temperature and pressure. We also find that adhesion strength in atomically smooth surfaces is one to two orders of magnitude larger than those found in experiments, and conjecture that the reason is substrate roughness and the presence of organic adsorbents. Our theoretical framework also allows us to exploit our results on interfacial premelting in order to gain insight into heterogeneous ice nucleation. We show that apolar smooth substrates of whatever hydrophilicity are unlikely nucleators, and that too large hydrophilicity conspires also against ice nucleation. Furthermore, we exploit statistical-thermodynamic framework to shed light into the nature of the surface intermolecular forces promoting interfacial premelting, and provide a model to predict quasi-liquid layer thickness as a function of the substrate's hydrophilicity with great potential applications in fields ranging from earth sciences to aircraft engineering.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric polymer generators: the large bending regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an important difference between piezoelectric polymer films and solid crystals for the application to piezoelectric generators. In the case of polymers, the optimal piezoelectric response imposes {\it a large bending regime}. Starting from the linear Curie's constitutive equations, we develop an analytical model under the assumption of the large bending regime resulting from bulge testing configuration. This model shows a specific non-linear piezoelectric response, that follows a power $2/3$ of the mechanical excitation. The piezoelectric voltage and the corresponding power are then studied experimentally as a function of the angular frequency $\omega$ of the mechanical excitation, the load resistance $R$, and the thickness of the film $\ell$. The experimental results carried out on piezoelectric PVDF films validate the model.</description>

      <title>Driving forces in cell migration and pattern formation in a soft tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a description of cell diffusion in a soft tissue, paying special attention to the coupling of force, matter, and microforce balance laws through a suitable dissipation principle. To this end, we cast our framework into a multi-level schematics, comprising both kinematics and kinetics, based on a characterization of the free energy. We lay down first a force balance law, where force and stress fields are defined as power conjugate quantities to velocity fields and their gradients, then we give a species molar balance law, with chemical potential test fields, as power conjugate quantities to the rate of change of the species concentration, and finally a microforce balance law. The main feature of this framework is the constitutive expression for the chemical potential which is split into a term derived from the homogeneous convex part of the free energy and an active external chemical potential giving rise to the spinodal decomposition. The active part of the chemical potential is given an expression depending on the cell concentration and resembling the one defined in [Oster, Murray and Harris, J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 78 (1983)], where it is meant to characterize an upward cell diffusion induced by cell motility. Further we show how an external vector field, entering the microforce balance law as a power conjugate quantity to the rate of change of the concentration gradient, can guide the diffusion process to a different limit stationary pattern. This vector field could possibly model any directional cue or bias characterizing the interaction of the migrating cells and the surrounding tissue.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in coiling of falling viscous threads: Revisiting the geometric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Fluid Mechanic Sewing Machine" creates periodic patterns through the coiling nature of a viscous fluid falling onto a moving surface. At relatively moderate heights, the reported patterns are translating coiling, alternating loops, W pattern, and meander. A simplified theoretical model based on the geometry and local bending of the contact point can predict these patterns. We experimentally explore the patterns in this region by collecting new data to compare with the model. Our review of the model's bifurcation diagram reveals additional patterns beyond the ones reported, although current experiments have not shown their existence. The W pattern, previously omitted in a regime diagram because of its small region, is now shown explicitly. We report on the consistent appearance of a period-doubled version of the W pattern, as well as rare appearances of resonant patterns, both reported for the first time. Comparing the theoretical model to experimental data, we find that the predicted phase diagram and the meander variation deviate from observations. These deviations hint at an unaccounted dynamics that merits further study.</description>

      <title>Dynamical metastability and re-entrant localization of trapped active elements with speed and orientation fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of active elements performing persistent random motion with fluctuating active speed and in the presence of translational noise in a $d$-dimensional harmonic trap, modeling active speed generation through an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our approach employs an exact analytic method based on the Fokker-Planck equation to compute time-dependent moments of any dynamical variable of interest across arbitrary dimensions. We analyze dynamical crossovers in particle displacement before reaching the steady state, focusing on three key timescales: speed relaxation, persistence, and dynamical relaxation in the trap. Notably, for slow active speed relaxation, we observe an intermediate time metastable saturation in the mean-squared displacement before reaching the final steady state. The steady-state distributions of particle positions exhibit two types of non-Gaussian departures based on control parameters: bimodal distributions with negative excess kurtosis and heavy-tailed unimodal distributions with positive excess kurtosis. We obtain detailed steady-state phase diagrams using the exact calculation of excess kurtosis, identifying Gaussian and non-Gaussian regions and possible re-entrant transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation in the field of a rotating dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that two permanent magnets of fixed orientation will either always repel or attract one another regardless of the distance between them. However, if one magnet is rotated at sufficient speed, a stable position at a given equilibrium distance can exist for a second free magnet. The equilibrium is produced by magnetic forces alone, which are strong enough to maintain a levitating state under gravity. We show that a stable levitation can be obtained when the rotating magnet is tilted from the rotation axis, with no offset in its position. In this regime, the levitating magnet remains centered and its spinning rate remains negligible, while its magnetic moment precesses in synchronization with the driving magnet. We provide a physical explanation of the levitation through a model relying on static dipolar interactions between the two magnets and present experimental results which validate the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design Method with Enhanced Sampling for Complex Open Crystals: Application to Novel Zeolite Self-Assembly in a Coarse-Grained Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the synthesis of zeolites and exploring novel frameworks offer pivotal opportunities and challenges in materials design. While inverse design proves highly effective for simpler crystals, its application to intricate structures like zeolites poses severe challenges. Here, we introduce an innovative inverse design workflow tailored to efficiently reproduce target zeolite frameworks in a binary coarse-grained model using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. This workflow integrates an evolutionary parameter optimization strategy with a variant of the seeding approach. Using this method, we successfully reproduce Z1 and SGT zeolites, and Type-I clathrates, find new optimal parameters for known phases, such as the SOD and CFI, and even discover novel frameworks, such as Z5. This is done within a simple coarse-grained model for a tetrahedra-forming component and a structure-directing agent. Our methodology not only enables the screening of synthesis protocols but also facilitates the discovery of hypothetical zeolites.</description>

In addition to standard stochastic resetting, for which a reset occurs with a certain probability after \emph{each} step, we introduce a novel resetting protocol which we dubbed {\it dynamic resetting}. This protocol entails an additional dynamic constraint related to the direction of successive steps of the random walker. We study this novel protocol for a one-dimensional random walker on an infinite lattice. We analyze the impact of the constraint on the walker's mean-first passage time and the cost (fluctuations) of the resets as a function of distance of target from the resetting location. Further, cost optimized search strategies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Droplets sliding on soft solids shed elastocapillary rails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface tension of partially wetting droplets deforms soft substrates. These deformations are usually localized to a narrow region near the contact line, forming a so-called `elastocapillary ridge.' When a droplet slides along a substrate, the movement of the elastocapillary ridge dissipates energy in the substrate and slows the droplet down. Previous studies have analyzed isotropically spreading droplets and found that the advancing contact line `surfs' the elastocapillary ridge, with a velocity determined by a local balance of capillary forces and bulk rheology. Here, we experimentally explore the dynamics of a droplet sliding across soft substrates. At low velocities, the contact line is nearly circular, and dissipation increases logarithmically with speed. At higher droplet velocities, the contact line adopts a bullet-like shape, and the dissipation levels off. At the same time, droplets shed a pair of `elastocapillary rails' that fade away slowly behind it. These results suggest that droplets favor sliding along a stationary ridge over surfing atop a translating one.</description>

      <title>A novel 3D food printing technique: achieving tunable porosity and fracture properties via liquid rope coiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a 3D food printing (3DFP) method to create coiled structures, harnessing the liquid rope coiling effect as a rapid method of food printing with tunable fractural properties. By studying the printability and coil-forming ability of pea, carrot, and cookie dough inks, we identified optimal printing parameters to induce steady and controlled coiling, enabling the creation of coiled structures with tunable porosities using a single nozzle. Fracture profiles from post-processed coiled structures showed complex responses but presented direct correlations between the porosity and textural parameters, including hardness, brittleness, and initial stiffness. This study provides a foundation for the fabrication of coiled food structures using 3DFP and highlights its potential application in designing textural properties and a range of unique sensory experiences.</description>

      <title>Life at low Reynolds number isn't such a drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following is an unedited version of two short articles that are forthcoming in Nature Chemical Engineering. Inspired by Purcell's classic lecture "Life at low Reynolds number", I discuss how scaling arguments, dimensional analysis, and fundamental concepts from chemical engineering science can be used to quantitatively describe microbial swimming -- thereby helping to better understand biological systems and inspiring new engineering advances in turn.</description>
