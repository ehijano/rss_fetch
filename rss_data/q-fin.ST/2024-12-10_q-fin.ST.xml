      <title>A Decision Support System for Stock Selection and Asset Allocation Based on Fundamental Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are integral to a country's economic success, yet their complex nature raises challenging issues for predicting their behaviors. There is a growing demand for an integrated system that explores the vast and diverse data in financial reports with powerful machine-learning models to analyze financial markets and suggest appropriate investment strategies. This research provides an end-to-end decision support system (DSS) that pervasively covers the stages of gathering, cleaning, and modeling the stock's financial and fundamental data alongside the country's macroeconomic conditions. Analyzing and modeling the fundamental data of securities is a noteworthy method that, despite its greater power, has been used by fewer researchers due to its more complex and challenging issues. By precisely analyzing securities' fundamental data, the proposed system assists investors in predicting stock future prices and allocating assets in major financial markets: stock, bond, and commodity. The most notable contributions and innovations of this research are: (1) Developing a robust predictive model for mid- to long-term stock returns, tailored for investors rather than traders, (2) The proposed DSS considers a diverse set of features relating to the economic conditions of the company, including fundamental data, stock trading characteristics, and macro-economic attributes to enhance predictive accuracy, (3) Evaluating the DSS performance on the Tehran Stock Exchange that has specific characteristics of small to medium-sized economies with high inflation rates and showing the superiority to novel researches, and (4) Empowering the DSS to generate different asset allocation strategies in various economic situations by simulating expert investor decision-making.</description>

      <title>Multi-Factor Function-on-Function Regression of Bond Yields on WTI Commodity Futures Term Structure Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the analysis of commodity futures, it is commonly assumed that futures prices are driven by two latent factors: short-term fluctuations and long-term equilibrium price levels. In this study, we extend this framework by introducing a novel state-space functional regression model that incorporates yield curve dynamics. Our model offers a distinct advantage in capturing the interdependencies between commodity futures and the yield curve. Through a comprehensive empirical analysis of WTI crude oil futures, using US Treasury yields as a functional predictor, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of the functional regression model compared to the Schwartz-Smith two-factor model, particularly in estimating the short-end of the futures curve. Additionally, we conduct a stress testing analysis to examine the impact of both temporary and permanent shocks to US Treasury yields on futures price estimation.</description>

      <title>Systematic comparison of deep generative models applied to multivariate financial time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time series (FTS) generation models are a core pillar to applications in finance. Risk management and portfolio optimization rely on realistic multivariate price generation models. Accordingly, there is a strong modelling literature dating back to Bachelier's Theory of Speculation in 1901. Generating FTS using deep generative models (DGMs) is still in its infancy. In this work, we systematically compare DGMs against state-of-the-art parametric alternatives for multivariate FTS generation. We initially compare both DGMs and parametric models over increasingly complex synthetic datasets. The models are evaluated through distance measures for varying distribution moments of both the full and rolling FTS. We then apply the best performing DGM models to empirical data, demonstrating the benefit of DGMs through a implied volatility trading task.</description>

      <title>Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we model the EFP spread using a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in the spirit of the two-factor Hull-White model for interest rates. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>
