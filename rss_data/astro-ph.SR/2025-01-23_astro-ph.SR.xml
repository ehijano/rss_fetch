      <title>First photometric investigation of V517 Cam combined with ground-based and TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observations of eclipsing binary systems are of great importance in astrophysics, as they allow direct measurements of fundamental stellar parameters. By analysing high-quality space-based observations with ground-based photometric data, it becomes possible to detect these fundamental parameters with greater precision using multicolour photometry. Here, we report the first photometric analysis results of the V517 Cam eclipsing binary system by combining the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve and new CCD observations in BVRI filters, obtained with a 60 cm robotic telescope (T60) at the T\"UB\.ITAK National Observatory. By means of photometric analyses, the masses and radii of the primary and secondary stars were carefully determined to be $M_{1}= 1.47\pm 0.06\,M_\odot$, $M_{2}= 0.79\pm0.05\,M_\odot$, and $R_{1}=1.43\pm 0.03\,R_\odot$, $R_{2}= 0.75\pm 0.04\,R_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, the distance to V517 Cam was calculated to be $284\pm20$ pc. The overall age of the system is estimated to be around $63\pm15$ Myr. At this age, the primary component stands near the onset of its main-sequence evolution, near the ZAMS, whereas the secondary component remains in the pre-main-sequence evolutionary phase. To better understand the evolutionary status and nature of V517 Cam, the mass ratio and temperature values, obtained with relatively low sensitivity by photometric measurements, need to be confirmed by spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of High-Velocity Stars Utilizing LAMOST and Gaia DR3 Archives within 100 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematic parameters identified from high-velocity stars situated within 100 kpc are examined and analyzed. We included three high velocity programs comprising 591, 87, and 519 stars as a function of distances ranging from 0.10 to nearly 109 kpc. In this analysis, we will determine the spatial velocities (U, V, W) in galactic coordinates along with their velocity dispersion (sigma_1, sigma_2, sigma_3), the convergent point (Ao, Do), and therefore, the solar motion (S_sun).</description>

      <title>Near-infrared Integral-field Spectroscopy of the Wind Forming Region of CW Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumstellar envelope of the carbon star CW Leo exhibited various unexpected changes in recent optical imaging observations. We have performed a follow-up observation using the Near-infrared Integral-Field Spectrograph (NIFS) equipped on the Gemini-North telescope. We report the near-infrared counterparts of a local brightness peak in the optical at the stellar position of CW Leo. On the other hand, a second peak detected at short wavelengths in the J band coincides with the brightest, bluest position in the optical images. The absorption features in the K band are minimized at a radius of 0.2 arcsec from the predicted stellar position. The reduction of the absorption depths likely indicates dilution of the absorption features by thermal emission of dust grains newly formed at such a radius and heated by radiation from the central star. The broad absorption feature at 1.53 um is significantly deeper than in template carbon stars, consistent with the presence of a substantial amount of circumstellar material around CW Leo. Its northeastern quadrant lacks circumstellar absorption features and scattered light in the near-infrared regime, which are possibly manifestations of its conical cavity in both gas and dust. In addition, a cross correlation of CO overtone bands indicates that the average expansion velocity of dust grains is smaller to the northern direction, likewise the velocity of transverse wind components derived using the differential proper motion of a circumstellar whirled pattern. The gradual brightening of CW Leo and the changes in its innermost circumstellar envelope need further continuous monitoring observations to properly understand its transitional phase toward the post-asymptotic-giant-branch stage.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian spectral analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks: Applications over GONG H$\alpha$ solar data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but recent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these periodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments. A systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light on the evolution of the prominences. Until now, only manual techniques have been used to analyze these oscillations.
  Aims. This work serves as a proof of concept, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks automatically detect filament oscillations by applying power-spectrum analysis to H$\alpha$ data from the GONG telescope network.
  Methods. The proposed technique studies periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\alpha$ data cubes. Using the Lomb Scargle periodogram, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the dataset. The background noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. Using Bayesian statistics and Markov chains -- Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms we can fit the spectra and determine the confidence threshold of a given percentage to search for real oscillations. We built two CNN models to obtain the same results as the MCMC approach.
  Results. We applied the CNN models to some observations reported in the literature, proving its reliability in detecting the same events as the classical methods. A day with events not previously reported has been studied to check for the model capabilities outside of a controlled dataset where we can check with previous reports.
  Conclusions. CNNs proved to be a useful tool to study solar filament oscillations, using spectral techniques. Computing times have been reduced significantly while getting results similar enough to the classical methods. This is a relevant step towards the automatic detection of filament oscillations.</description>

      <title>A Study of Subsurface Convection Zones of Fast Rotating Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subsurface convective zones (CZs) of massive stars significantly influences many of their key characteristics. Previous studies have paid little attention to the impact of rotation on the subsurface convective zone (CZ), so we aim to investigate the evolution of this zone in rapidly rotating massive stars. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to simulate the subsurface CZs of massive stars during the main sequence phase. We establish stellar models with initial masses ranging from 5 $M_{\odot}$ to 120 $M_{\odot}$, incorporating four metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.006, 0.002, and 0.0001) and three rotational velocities ($\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0, $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.50, and $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.75). We find that rapid rotation leads to an expansion of the subsurface CZ, increases convective velocities, and promotes the development of this zone. Additionally, subsurface CZs can also emerge in stars with lower metallicities. Comparing our models with observations of massive stars in the Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, we find that rotating models better encompass the observed samples. Rotation significantly influences the evolution of the subsurface CZ in massive stars. By comparing with the observed microturbulence on the surfaces of OB stars, we propose that the subsurface CZs may be one of the sources of microturbulence.</description>

      <title>Horizontal flows in the atmospheres of chemically peculiar stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Classical chemically peculiar stars exhibit atmospheres that are often structured by the effects of atomic diffusion. As a result of these elemental diffusion and horizontal abundance variations, photospheric temperature varies at a given height in the atmosphere. This may lead to horizontal flows in the photosphere. In addition, the suppression of such flows by magnetic field can alter the elemental transport processes. Aims. Using a simplified model of such a structured atmosphere and 2D MHD simulations of a typical He-rich star, we examine atmospheric flows in these chemically peculiar stars which often are strongly magnetic. Methods. We use Zeus-MP which is a Fortran 90 based publicly available parallel finite element modular code. Results. We find that for non-magnetic stars of spectral type BA, atmospheric flow related to horizontal temperature gradient can reach 1.0 km/s yielding mixing timescale of order of tens of days. For the magnetic counterparts, the flow speeds are an order of magnitude lower allowing for stratification of chemical elements. Conclusions. Magnetic field can influence the dynamics in atmospheres significantly. Strong horizontal magnetic field inhibits flow in the vertical direction, while strong vertical magnetic field can suppress horizontal atmospheric flow preventing elemental mixing.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photons from intermediate-mass to very massive stars with PARSEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12917v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.</description>

      <title>HH 270/110 as a jet/shear layer interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New observations obtained with JWST of the proto-stellar HH~270 jet and the "deflected" HH 110 system, show that HH 110 has a morphology of a series of distorted working surfaces. These working surfaces appear to be "deflected versions" of the heads of the incident, HH 270 jet. We compute a series of 3D numerical simulations, in which we explore the possible parameters of a shearing environment that could give origin to the deflection of HH 270 into the HH 110 flow. We find that we need a quite high sideways velocity for the streaming environment (of ~30km/s) in order to produce the complex structure observed in HH 110. This high velocity would be possible in an environment which has been strongly perturbed by the passage of other outflows.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of Sco X-1: implications for the current spin frequency and ellipticity of the neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sco X-1 is the brightest observed extra-solar X-ray source, which is a neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), and is thought to have a strong potential for continuous gravitational waves (CW) detection due to its high accretion rate and relative proximity. Here, we compute the long-term evolution of its parameters, particularly the NS spin frequency ($\nu$) and the surface magnetic field ($B$), to probe its nature and its potential for CW detection. We find that Sco X-1 is an unusually young ($\sim7\times10^6$ yr) LMXB and constrain the current NS mass to $\sim 1.4-1.6~{\rm M}_\odot$. Our computations reveal a rapid $B$ decay, with the maximum current value of $\sim 1.8\times10^8$ G, which can be useful to constrain the decay models. Note that the maximum current $\nu$ value is $\sim 550$ Hz, implying that, unlike what is generally believed, a CW emission is not required to explain the current source properties. However, $\nu$ will exceed an observed cut-off frequency of $\sim 730$ Hz, and perhaps even the NS break-up frequency, in the future, without a CW emission. The minimum NS mass quadrupole moment ($Q$) to avoid this is $\sim (2-3)\times10^{37}$ g cm$^2$, corresponding to a CW strain of $\sim 10^{-26}$. Our estimation of current $\nu$ values can improve the CW search sensitivity.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission from helium star+black hole binaries as probes of tidally induced spin-up of second-born black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidally induced spin-up of stripped helium stars in short-period (&lt;\,1\,d) binaries with black holes has been presented as one of the possible mechanisms to reproduce the high-spin tail of the black hole spin distribution derived from gravitational wave (GW) merger observations. At such short periods, a fraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be accreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be released as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray luminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium stars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries that merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for estimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black holes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive lower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped helium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 $Z_{\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large fraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also transfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities above $10^{35}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\sim10^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. Such binaries should be observable as X-ray bright systems at 0.1\,$Z_{\odot}$, 0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$, representative of Sextans A, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Solar neighbourhood, respectively. The formation efficiency of these systems increases with decreasing metallicity. However, accounting for the local star formation rates, our population synthesis predicts $\sim$2 and $\sim$1 such observable binaries in the Milky Way and LMC, respectively, that will produce a binary compact object merger within a Hubble time.

      <title>Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: the low-energy explosion of an ultra-stripped star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most stripped-envelope supernova progenitors are thought to be formed through binary interaction, losing hydrogen and/or helium from their outer layers. Ultra-stripped supernovae are an emerging class of transient which are expected to be produced through envelope-stripping by a NS companion. However, relatively few examples are known and the outcomes of such systems can be diverse and are poorly understood at present. Here, we present spectroscopic observations and high-cadence, multi-band photometry of SN 2023zaw, a rapidly evolving supernova with a low ejecta mass discovered in a nearby spiral galaxy at D = 39.7 Mpc. It has significant Milky Way extinction, $E(B-V)_{\rm MW} = 0.21$, and significant (but uncertain) host extinction. Bayesian evidence comparison reveals that nickel is not the only power source and an additional energy source is required to explain our observations. Our models suggest an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.07$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and a synthesized nickel mass of $M_{\rm Ni} \sim 0.007$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ are required to explain the observations. We find that additional heating from a central engine, or interaction with circumstellar material can power the early light curve.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Galactic population of free-floating planets from realistic initial conditions</title>

Abstract: We present the first prediction for the mass distribution function of Galactic free-floating planets (FFPs) that aims to accurately include the relative contributions of multiple formation pathways and stellar populations. We derive our predicted distribution from dedicated simulations of planet birth, growth, migration, and ejection around circumbinary systems and extend these results to also include the contributions from single and wide binary systems. Our resulting FFP mass distribution shows several distinct features, including a strong peak at $\sim 8 M_{\oplus}$ arising from the transition between pebble and gas accretion regimes and a trough at $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ due to the shift in the dominant ejection process from planet-planet scattering to ejection through interactions with stars in circumbinary systems. We find that interactions with the central binary in close circumbinary systems are likely the dominant progenitor for FFPs more massive than Earth, leading to a steep power-law dependence in mass that agrees well with existing observations. In contrast, we find planet-planet scattering events in single and wide binary systems likely produce the majority of planets at Mars mass and below, resulting in a shallower power-law dependence. Our results suggest that existing extrapolations into the sub-terrestrial mass range may significantly overestimate the true FFP abundance. The features we predict in the mass distribution of FFPs will be detectable by upcoming space-based microlensing surveys and, if observed, will provide key insight into the origins of FFPs and the environments in which they form.</description>

      <title>Internal Dynamics of Multiple Populations in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters: A Wide-Field study with Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) across a wide field of view, extending from the innermost regions to the clusters' outskirts. Using astro-photometric catalogs from ground-based observations, Gaia, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify first- (1P) and second-population (2P) stars, and study the internal dynamics of MPs using high-precision Gaia DR3 and HST proper motions. Our results reveal that while the 1P transitions from isotropy to slight tangential anisotropy toward the outer regions, 2P stars become increasingly radially anisotropic beyond the half-light radius. We also explore the connection between the dynamics of MPs and the clusters' structural and dynamical properties, finding statistically significant differences in the anisotropy profiles of dynamically young and non-relaxed clusters, particularly beyond the 1-2 half-light radii. In these regions, 1P stars transition from isotropic to slightly tangentially anisotropic motion, while 2P stars become more radially anisotropic.
  In contrast, dynamically older clusters, with mixed MPs, exhibit weaker relative differences. Furthermore, clusters with orbits closer to the Galactic center exhibit larger dynamical differences between 1P and 2P stars than those with larger peri-Galactic radii. These findings are consistent with a scenario where 2P stars form in a more centrally concentrated environment, where the interaction with the Milky Way tidal field plays a crucial role in the dynamical evolution of MPs, especially of 1P.</description>
