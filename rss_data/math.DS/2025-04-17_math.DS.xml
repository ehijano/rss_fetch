      <title>A Frequency-Domain Differential Corrector for Quasi-Periodic Trajectory Design and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Frequency-Domain Differential Corrector (FDDC), a model-agnostic approach for constructing quasi-periodic orbits (QPOs) across a range of dynamical regimes. In contrast to existing methods that explicitly enforce an invariance condition in all frequency dimensions, the FDDC targets dominant spectral components identified through frequency-domain analysis. Leveraging frequency refinement strategies such as Laskar-Numerical Analysis of Fundamental Frequency (L-NAFF) and G\'omez-Mondelo-Sim\'o-Collocation (GMS-C), the method enables efficient and scalable generation of high-dimensional QPOs. The FDDC is demonstrated in both single- and multiple-shooting formulations. While the study focuses on the Earth-Moon system, the framework is broadly applicable to other celestial environments. Sample applications include Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs), Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs), and Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs), illustrating constellation design and the recovery of analog solutions in higher-fidelity models. With its model-independent formulation and spectral targeting capabilities, FDDC offers a versatile tool for robust trajectory design and mission planning in complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergence for Sparse Ergodic Averages in $L^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unified framework to proving pointwise convergence of sparse sequences, deterministic and random, at the $L^1(X)$ endpoint. Specifically, suppose that \[ a_n \in \{ \lfloor n^c \rfloor, \min\{ k : \sum_{j \leq k} X_j = n\} \} \] where $X_j$ are Bernoulli random variables with expectations $\mathbb{E} X_j = n^{-\alpha}$, and we restrict to $1 &lt; c &lt; 8/7, \ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$.
  Then (almost surely) for any measure-preserving system, $(X,\mu,T)$, and any $f \in L^1(X)$, the ergodic averages \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{a_n} f \] converge $\mu$-a.e. Moreover, our proof gives new quantitative estimates on the rate of convergence, using jump-counting/variation/oscillation technology, pioneered by Bourgain.
  This improves on previous work of Urban-Zienkiewicz, and Mirek, who established the above with $c = \frac{1001}{1000}, \ \frac{30}{29}$, respectively, and LaVictoire, who established the random result, all in a non-quantitative setting.</description>

      <title>A functional limit theorem for a dynamical system with an observable maximised on a Cantor set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider heavy-tailed observables maximised on a dynamically defined Cantor set and prove convergence of the associated point processes as well as functional limit theorems. The Cantor structure, and its connection to the dynamics, causes clustering of large observations: this is captured in the `decorations' on our point processes and functional limits, an application of the theory developed in a paper by the latter three authors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for non-uniform systems with controlled specification and entropy expansiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic formalism of dynamical systems with non-uniform structure. Precisely, we obtain the uniqueness of equilibrium states for a family of non-uniformly expansive flows by generalizing Climenhaga-Thompson's orbit decomposition criteria. In particular, such family includes entropy expansive flows. Meanwhile, the essential part of the decomposition is allowed to satisfy an even weaker version of specification, namely controlled specification, thus also extends the corresponding results by Pavlov.
  Two applications of our abstract theorems are explored. Firstly, we introduce a notion of regularity condition called weak Walters condition, and study the uniqueness of measure of maximal entropy for a suspension flow with roof function satisfying such condition. Secondly, we investigate topologically transitive frame flows on rank one manifolds of nonpositive curvature, which is a group extension of nonuniformly hyperbolic flows. Under a bunched curvature condition and running a Gauss-Bonnet type of argument, we show the uniqueness of equilibrium states with respect to certain potentials.</description>

      <title>New developments in MatCont: delay equation importer and Lyapunov exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MatCont is a powerful toolbox for numerical bifurcation analysis focussing on smooth ODEs. A user can study equilibria, periodic and connecting orbits, and their stability and bifurcations. Here, we report on additional features in version 7p6. The first is a delay equation importer enabling MatCont users to study a much larger class of models, namely delay equations with finite delay (including delay differential and renewal equations). This importer translates the delay equation into a system of ODEs using a pseudospectral approximation with an order specified by the user. We also implemented Lyapunov exponent computations, event functions for Poincar\'e maps, and enhanced homoclinic continuation. We demonstrate these features with test cases, such as the Mackey-Glass equation and a renewal equation, and provide additional examples in online tutorials.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Haken Lighthouse Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple spiking neural network models, such as those built from interacting integrate-and-fire (IF) units, exhibit rich emergent behaviours but remain notoriously difficult to analyse, particularly in terms of their pattern-forming properties. In contrast, rate-based models and coupled phase oscillators offer greater mathematical tractability but fail to capture the full dynamical complexity of spiking networks. To bridge these modelling paradigms, Hermann Haken -- the pioneer of Synergetics -- introduced the Lighthouse model, a framework that provides insights into synchronisation, travelling waves, and pattern formation in neural systems.
  In this work, we revisit the Lighthouse model and develop new mathematical results that deepen our understanding of self-organisation in spiking neural networks. Specifically, we derive the linear stability conditions for phase-locked spiking states in Lighthouse networks structured on graphs with realistic synaptic interactions ($\alpha$-function synapses) and axonal conduction delays. Extending the analysis on graphs to a spatially continuous (non-local) setting, we develop a variant of Turing instability analysis to explore emergent spiking patterns. Finally, we show how localised spiking bump solutions -- which are difficult to mathematically analyse in IF networks -- are far more tractable in the Lighthouse model and analyse their linear stability to wandering states.
  These results reaffirm the Lighthouse model as a valuable tool for studying structured neural interactions and self-organisation, further advancing the synergetic perspective on spiking neural dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize $C^*$-simplicity for countable groups by means of the following dichotomy. If a group is $C^*$-simple, then the action on the Poisson boundary is essentially free for a generic measure on the group. If a group is not $C^*$-simple, then the action on the Poisson boundary is not essentially free for a generic measure on the group.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification and invariant solutions of the classical geometric mean reversion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Lie symmetry method, we investigate a Feynman-Kac formula for the classical geometric mean reversion process, which effectively describing the dynamics of short-term interest rates. The Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries and the corresponding one-parameter symmetry groups of the equation are obtained. An optimal system of invariant solutions are constructed by a derived optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Because of taking into account a supply response to price rises, this equation provides for a more realistic assumption than the geometric Brownian motion in many investment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Teichm\"uller spaces, polynomial loci, and degeneration in spaces of algebraic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analog of the notion of a character variety in the context of algebraic correspondences. It turns out that matings of certain Fuchsian groups and polynomials are contained in this ambient character variety. This gives rise to two different analogs of the Bers slice by fixing either the polynomial or the Fuchsian group. The Bers-like slices are homeomorphic copies of Teichm\"uller spaces or combinatorial copies of polynomial connectedness loci. We show that these slices are bounded in the character variety, thus proving the analog of a theorem of Bers. To produce compactifications of the Bers-like slices, we initiate a study of degeneration of algebraic correspondences on trees of Riemann spheres, revealing a new degeneration phenomenon in conformal dynamics. There is no available analog of Sullivan's 'no invariant line field' theorem in our context. Nevertheless, for the four times punctured sphere, we show that the compactifications of Teichm\"uller spaces are naturally homeomorphic.</description>

      <title>Resonances in reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.</description>

      <title>The effect of timescale separation on the tipping window for chaotically forced systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tipping behaviour can occur when an equilibrium loses stability in response to a slowly varying parameter crossing a bifurcation threshold, or where noise drives a system from one attractor to another, or some combination of these effects. Similar behaviour can be expected when a multistable system is forced by a chaotic deterministic system rather than by noise. In this context, the chaotic tipping window was recently introduced and investigated for discrete-time dynamics. In this paper, we find tipping windows for continuous-time nonlinear systems forced by chaos. We characterise the tipping window in terms of forcing by unstable periodic orbits of the chaos, and we show how the location and structure of this window depend on the relative timescales between the forcing and the responding system. We illustrate this by finding tipping windows for two examples of coupled bistable ODEs forced with chaos. Additionally, we describe the dynamic tipping window in the setting of a changing system parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs), generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal pattern formation under varying functional response parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancement of the predictive power and robustness of nonlinear population dynamics models allows ecologists to make more reliable forecasts about species' long term survival. However, the limited availability of detailed ecological data, especially for complex ecological interactions creates uncertainty in model predictions, often requiring adjustments to the mathematical formulation of these interactions. Modifying the mathematical representation of components responsible for complex behaviors, such as predation, can further contribute to this uncertainty, a phenomenon known as structural sensitivity. Structural sensitivity has been explored primarily in non-spatial systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and in a limited number of simple, spatially extended systems modeled by nonhomogeneous parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), where self-diffusion alone cannot produce spatial patterns. In this study, we broaden the scope of structural sensitivity analysis to include spatio-temporal ecological systems in which spatial patterns can emerge due to diffusive instability. Through a combination of analytical techniques and supporting numerical simulations, we show that pattern formation can be highly sensitive to how the system and its associated ecological interactions are mathematically parameterized. In fact, some patterns observed in one version of the model may completely disappear in another with a different parameterization, even though the underlying properties remain unchanged.</description>

      <title>On $k$-free numbers in cyclotomic fields: entropy, symmetries and topological invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point sets of number-theoretic origin, such as the visible lattice points or the $k$-th power free integers, have interesting geometric and spectral properties and give rise to topological dynamical systems that belong to a large class of subshifts with positive topological entropy. Among them are $\cB$-free systems in one dimension and their higher-dimensional generalisations, most prominently the $k$-free integers in algebraic number fields. Here, we extend previous work on quadratic fields to the class of cyclotomic fields. In particular, we discuss their entropy and extended symmetries, with special focus on the interplay between dynamical and number-theoretic notions.</description>

Abstract: We provide a complex-analytic approach to the classification of stationary probability measures on $S^1$ with respect to the action of $PSU(1,1)$ on the unit circle via M\"{o}bius transformations by studying their Cauchy transforms from the perspective of generalized analytic continuation. We improve upon results of Bourgain and present a complete characterization of Furstenberg measures for Fuchsian groups of first kind via the Brown-Shields-Zeller theorem.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Partially Hyperbolic Dichotomy: Hyperbolicity versus Nonhyperbolic Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a conservative and partially hyperbolic three-dimensional setting, we study three representative classes of diffeomorphisms: those homotopic to Anosov (or Derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms), diffeomorphisms in neighborhoods of the time-one map of the geodesic flow on a surface of negative curvature, and accessible and dynamically coherent skew products with circle fibers. In any of these classes, we establish the following dichotomy: either the diffeomorphism is Anosov, or it possesses nonhyperbolic ergodic measures. Our approach is perturbation-free and combines recent advances in the study of stably ergodic diffeomorphisms with a variation of the periodic approximation method to obtain ergodic measures.
  A key result in our construction, independent of conservative hypotheses, is the construction of nonhyperbolic ergodic measures for sets with a minimal strong unstable foliation that satisfy the mostly expanding property. This approach enables us to obtain nonhyperbolic ergodic measures in other contexts, including some subclasses of the so-called anomalous partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms that are not dynamically coherent.</description>

      <title>Wandering Flows on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study planar flows without non-wandering points and prove several properties of these flows in relation with their prolongational relation. The main results of this article are that a planar (regular) wandering flow has no generalized recurrence and has only two topological invariants: the space of its orbits and its prolongational relation (or, equivalently, its smallest stream). As a byproduct, our results show that, even in absence of any type of recurrence, the stream of a flow contains fundamental information on its behavior.</description>

      <title>Diagonal comparison of ample C*-diagonals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce diagonal comparison, a regularity property of diagonal pairs where the sub-C*-algebra has totally disconnected spectrum, and establish its equivalence with the concurrence of strict comparison of the ambient C*-algebra and dynamical comparison of the underlying dynamics induced by the partial action of the normalisers. As an application, we show that for diagonal pairs arising from principal minimal transformation groupoids with totally disconnected unit space, diagonal comparison is equivalent to tracial Z-stability of the pair and that it is implied by finite diagonal dimension.
  In-between, we show that any projection of the diagonal sub-C*-algebra can be uniformly tracially divided, and explore a property of conditional expectations onto abelian sub-C*-algebras, namely containment of every positive element in the hereditary subalgebra generated by its conditional expectation. We show that the expectation associated to a C*-pair with finite diagonal dimension is always hereditary in that sense, and we give an example where this property does not occur.</description>
