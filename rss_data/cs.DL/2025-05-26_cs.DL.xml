      <title>Towards Industrial Convergence : Understanding the evolution of scientific norms and practices in the field of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research, there seems to be a rapprochement between academics and industrial forces. The aim of this study is to assess whether and to what extent industrial domination in the field as well as the ever more frequent switch between academia and industry resulted in the adoption of industrial norms and practices by academics. Using bibliometric information and data on scientific code, we aimed to understand academic and industrial researchers' practices, the way of choosing, investing, and succeeding across multiple and concurrent artifacts. Our results show that, although both actors write papers and code, their practices and the norms guiding them differ greatly. Nevertheless, it appears that the presence of industrials in academic studies leads to practices leaning toward the industrial side, but also to greater success in both artifacts, suggesting that if convergence is, then it is passing through those mixed teams rather than through pure academic or industrial studies.</description>

      <title>Gaming the Metrics? Bibliometric Anomalies and the Integrity Crisis in Global University Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global university rankings have reshaped how academic success is defined, incentivizing metrics such as publication counts and citation rates at the expense of scholarly integrity. This study examines 18 universities in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, selected from among the world's 1,000 most-publishing institutions for their extraordinary research growth and sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. These institutions exhibit bibliometric patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization, including publication surges of up to 965%, a proliferation of hyper-prolific authors, dense reciprocal co-authorship and citation networks, elevated shares of output in delisted journals, and rising retraction rates. These patterns are analyzed in light of Goodhart's Law and institutional isomorphism, illustrating how performance pressures can reshape academic behavior. To systematically assess and monitor such risks, the study introduces the Research Integrity Risk Index (RI2), a composite indicator based on retraction rates and reliance on delisted journals. RI2 effectively identifies institutions with bibliometric profiles that diverge from global norms and may warrant closer examination. The findings highlight the urgent need for integrity-sensitive reforms in how rankings, funders, and institutions assess scholarly performance.</description>

      <title>Semantic Web and Software Agents -- A Forgotten Wave of Artificial Intelligence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a narrative of waves -- rising optimism followed by crashing disappointments. AI winters, such as the early 2000s, are often remembered as barren periods of innovation. This paper argues that such a perspective overlooks a crucial wave of AI that seems to be forgotten: the rise of the Semantic Web, which is based on knowledge representation, logic, and reasoning, and its interplay with intelligent Software Agents. Fast forward to today, and ChatGPT has reignited AI enthusiasm, built on deep learning and advanced neural models. However, before Large Language Models (LLMs) dominated the conversation, another ambitious vision emerged -- one where AI-driven Software Agents autonomously served Web users based on a structured, machine-interpretable Web. The Semantic Web aimed to transform the World Wide Web into an ecosystem where AI could reason, understand, and act. Between 2000 and 2010, this vision sparked a significant research boom, only to fade into obscurity as AI's mainstream narrative shifted elsewhere. Today, as LLMs edge toward autonomous execution, we revisit this overlooked wave. By analyzing its academic impact through bibliometric data, we highlight the Semantic Web's role in AI history and its untapped potential for modern Software Agent development. Recognizing this forgotten chapter not only deepens our understanding of AI's cyclical evolution but also offers key insights for integrating emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>SemEval-2025 Task 5: LLMs4Subjects -- LLM-based Automated Subject Tagging for a National Technical Library's Open-Access Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SemEval-2025 Task 5: LLMs4Subjects, a shared task on automated subject tagging for scientific and technical records in English and German using the GND taxonomy. Participants developed LLM-based systems to recommend top-k subjects, evaluated through quantitative metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and qualitative assessments by subject specialists. Results highlight the effectiveness of LLM ensembles, synthetic data generation, and multilingual processing, offering insights into applying LLMs for digital library classification.</description>
