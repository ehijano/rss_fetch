      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Management Studies (2021-2025): A Bibliometric Mapping of Themes, Trends, and Global Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI has become one of the most influential research areas over the past decade, with growing applications across multiple disciplines. In management studies, artificial intelligence is increasingly recognized as a driver of innovation, sustainability, and decision-making support. This bibliometric study examines the evolution of AI-related research in management between 2021 and 2025. Data were collected from the Scopus database and analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package, with visualizations generated through VOSviewer. The dataset consisted of 5,624 documents filtered by subject area, document type, and language. The analysis included annual scientific production, country and institutional contributions, leading journals, co-authorship networks, keyword co-occurrence, and thematic mapping. Results reveal a strong increase in publications from 2021 to 2024, followed by a decline in 2025. China, India, and the United States lead in publication output, while the United Kingdom shows higher citation impact. Thematic analysis indicates a shift from technical applications of AI to broader concerns such as sustainability, digital transformation, and decision-making processes. These findings highlight a changing landscape in AI research within management, where technological innovation, social responsibility, and organizational performance converge to shape future directions.</description>
