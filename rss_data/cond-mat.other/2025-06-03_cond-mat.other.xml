      <title>Dependency of quantum time scales on symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although used extensively in everyday life, time is one of the least understood quantities in physics, especially on the level of quantum mechanics. Here we use an experimental method based on spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from spin-degenerate dispersive states to determine the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith (EWS) time delay of photoemission. This time scale of the quantum transition is measured for materials with different dimensionality and correlation strength. A direct link between the dimensionality, or rather the symmetry of the system, and the attosecond photoionisation time scale is found. The quasi 2-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides 1T-TiSe$_2$ and 1T-TiTe$_2$ show time scales around 150 as, whereas in quasi 1-dimensional CuTe the photoionisation takes more than 200 as. This is in stark contrast with the 26 as found for 3-dimensional pure Cu. These results provide new insights into the role of symmetry in quantum time scales and may provide a route to understanding the role of time in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple example illustrating non-conservation of action variables in integrable classical mechanical systems with many degrees of freedom during adiabatically slow evolution. We also emphasize the importance of the mass parameter of a harmonic oscillator, alongside its frequency, in explicitly time-dependent situations.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>Realization of broken inversion symmetry in the charge density wave phase in EuAl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EuAl$_4$ exhibits a complex phase diagram, including the development of a charge density wave (CDW) below $T_{CDW} = 145$ K. Below $T_{N}=15.4$ K, a series of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered phases appear, while non-trivial topological phases, like skyrmion lattices, are stabilized under an applied magnetic field. The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q} \approx 0.17\,\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\,0\,\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Electronic Temperature-Driven Phase Stability and Structural Evolution of Iron at High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gibbs free-energy phase diagrams for compressed iron within a pressure range of 20 to 300 GPa and electronic temperature up to 3 eV obtained using finite-temperature density functional and density functional perturbation theories. Our results for bcc, fcc, and hcp phases predict solid-solid phase transitions in iron driven purely by electronic entropy and temperature. We found a phase transition from hcp to bcc at pressures above 200 GPa, which depends on the electronic temperature. An experimental observation of the stability of the bcc phase above 200 GPa by X-ray Free Electron Laser has recently been reported.</description>

      <title>Simulating Neutral Atom Quantum Systems with Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a tensor network simulation of a neutral atom quantum system under the presence of noise, while introducing a new purity-preserving truncation technique that compromises between the simplicity of the matrix product state and the positivity of the matrix product density operator. We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor in systems with fractional band dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometric tensor, which is comprised of the Berry curvature and quantum metric, in a generalized Dirac two-band system with non-integer dispersion $E(\mathbf{k})\sim k^{\alpha}$. Our analysis reveals that this type of dispersion introduces significant and novel effects on quantum band geometry. We calculate the Berry curvature and observe its redistribution in momentum space as \(\alpha\) varies. Notably, despite this redistribution, the change in Chern number across topological transitions remains quantized as an integer, even for non-integer \(\alpha\). We illustrate the physical implications of this redistribution by computing the orbital magnetization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Berry curvature and quantum metric peak along the regions of momentum space where the energy band exhibits high curvature. While it is well-established that Berry curvature becomes highly concentrated at the band touching points, our findings indicate that they can also accumulate at sharp band corners, away from these band touching points. We further show that while the Berry curvature develops Dirac delta-like peaks away from $\mathbf{k}=0$, the Berry monopole, corresponding to the topological charge, remains located at the origin.</description>

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>
