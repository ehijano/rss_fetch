      <title>Planning with Probabilistic Opacity and Transparency: A Computational Model of Opaque/Transparent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative opacity of a secret is a security property, which means that a system trajectory satisfying the secret is observation-equivalent to a trajectory violating the secret. In this paper, we study how to synthesize a control policy that maximizes the probability of a secret being made opaque against an eavesdropping attacker/observer, while subject to other task performance constraints. In contrast to existing belief-based approach for opacity-enforcement, we develop an approach that uses the observation function, the secret, and the model of the dynamical systems to construct a so-called opaque-observations automaton which accepts the exact set of observations that enforce opacity. Leveraging this opaque-observations automaton, we can reduce the optimal planning in Markov decision processes(MDPs) for maximizing probabilistic opacity or its dual notion, transparency, subject to task constraints into a constrained planning problem over an augmented-state MDP. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the developed methods in robot motion planning problems with opacity or transparency requirements.</description>

      <title>On Transcendence of Numbers Related to Sturmian and Arnoux-Rauzy Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider numbers of the form $S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u}):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{u_n}{\beta^n}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}=\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ is an infinite word over a finite alphabet and $\beta\in \mathbb{C}$ satisfies $|\beta|&gt;1$. Our main contribution is to present a combinatorial criterion on $\boldsymbol u$, called echoing, that implies that $S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u})$ is transcendental whenever $\beta$ is algebraic. We show that every Sturmian word is echoing, as is the Tribonacci word, a leading example of an Arnoux-Rauzy word. We furthermore characterise $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-linear independence of sets of the form $\left\{ 1, S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u}_1),\ldots,S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u}_k) \right\}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}_1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{u}_k$ are Sturmian words having the same slope. Finally, we give an application of the above linear independence criterion to the theory of dynamical systems, showing that for a contracted rotation on the unit circle with algebraic slope, its limit set is either finite or consists exclusively of transcendental elements other than its endpoints $0$ and $1$. This confirms a conjecture of Bugeaud, Kim, Laurent, and Nogueira.</description>

      <title>Bounded Generation of Submonoids of Heisenberg Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $G$ is a nilpotent group and $[G,G]$ has Hirsch length $1$, then every f.g. submonoid of $G$ is boundedly generated, i.e. a product of cyclic submonoids. Using a reduction of Bodart, this implies the decidability of the submonoid membership problem for nilpotent groups $G$ where $[G,G]$ has Hirsch length $2$.</description>

      <title>The Transformation Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of temporal logics designed to finely balance the trade-off between expressivity and complexity. Their key feature is the possibility of defining operators of a new kind that we call transformation operators. Some of them subsume existing temporal operators, while others are entirely novel. Of particular interest are transformation operators based on semigroups. They enable logics to harness the richness of semigroup theory, and we show them to yield logics capable of creating hierarchies of increasing expressivity and complexity which are non-trivial to characterise in existing logics. The result is a genuinely novel and yet unexplored landscape of temporal logics, each of them with the potential of matching the trade-off between expressivity and complexity required by specific applications.</description>
