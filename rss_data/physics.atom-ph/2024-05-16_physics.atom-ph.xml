      <title>Bound state properties, positron annihilation and hyperfine structure of the four-body positronium hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound state properties of the ground (bound) ${}^{1}S(L = 0)-$state(s) in the four-body positronium hydrides ${}^{1}$HPs, ${}^{2}$HPs (DPs), ${}^{3}$HPs (TPs) and MuPs are determined and investigated. By using numerical data from our computations of these four-body systems we have determined a number of different annihilation rates for each of these positronium hydrides and evaluated the hyperfine structure splitting. The properties of the ground (bound) states in the four-body exitonic ${}^{M}h^{+} e^{-}_{2} e^{+}$ complexes, where $M \ge 1$ and $M \le 1$, have also been evaluated numerically. The neutral four-body systems ${}^{M}h^{+} e^{-}_{2} e^{+}$ with $M \gg 1$ are similar to the HPs hydrides. In particular, each of these states has only one bound state. We also discuss applications of the exponential and semi-exponential variational expansions for accurate, bound state computations of the four-body positronium hydrides.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we theoretically develop and experimentally demonstrate a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase shift of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. Experimentally, we image a sparse lattice of $^{87}$Rb samples on the D2 line, to resolve their axial positions with micrometer precision, and to retrieve their complex-valued spectroscopic images. With the phase-angle readouts that are highly insensitive to atom-number and interaction-strength uncertainties, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot-resolution to the transition frequency with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate 3D sensing of local light shift with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and configuration-interaction study of $4d-3p$ x-ray transitions in Cu- and Ni-like tungsten ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $4d \to 3p$ x-ray transitions in Cu- and Ni-like tungsten ions have been studied theoretically. The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method and the large-scale relativistic configuration-interaction (CI) method have been employed in order to take into account electron correlation effects on the wavelengths and transition rates. It was found that the wavelengths and transition rates obtained from the MCDHF-CI method depend strongly on the size and the type of the active space used in the calculations. It has been found that extending the active space of orbitals without careful control of the configuration state function base does not always lead to good quality MCDHF-CI results for highly ionized tungsten ions.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling of barium monofluoride molecules using synthesized optical spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate laser cooling of barium monofluoride (138BaF) molecules. We use serrodynes to synthesize time-sequenced optical spectra that can be precisely tailored to the hyperfine structure of this heaviest non-radioactive alkaline earth monofluoride. By optimizing these optical spectra, we realize strong Sisyphus cooling forces that efficiently collimate a molecular beam. Our technique is an important step towards using intense beams of barium monofluoride for precision measurement applications, and will be useful for cooling other molecular species with complex level structure.</description>

      <title>Plasma Effects on Resonant Phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of autoionizing resonances in atomic systems and processes is reviewed. Theoretical framework for treating resonances in the coupled channel approximation using the R-matrix method, as well as approximations related to plasma applications are described. The former entails large-scale atomic computations, and the latter is based on a new method for including collisional, Stark, thermal and other broadening mechanisms. We focus particularly on the problem of opacities calculations in high-energy-density (HED) plasmas such as stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion devices. The treatment is generally relevant to radiative and collisional processes as the cross sections become energy-temperature-density dependent. While the computational difficulty increases considerably, the reaction rates are significantly affected. The related issue of the Boltzmann-Saha equation-of-state and its variants in local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) is also explored as the intermediary between atomic data on the one hand and plasma environments on the other.</description>

      <title>Finite-size catalysis in quantum resource theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum catalysis, the ability to enable previously impossible transformations by using auxiliary systems without degrading them, has emerged as a powerful tool in various resource theories. Although catalytically enabled state transformations have been formally characterized by the monotonic behaviour of entropic quantifiers (e.g., the von Neumann entropy or non-equilibrium free energy), such characterizations often rely on unphysical assumptions, namely the ability of using catalysts of infinitely large dimension. This approach offers very limited insights into the practical significance of using catalysis for quantum information processing. Here, we address this problem across a broad class of quantum resource theories. Leveraging quantum information tools beyond the asymptotic regime, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of catalytic transformations with finite-size catalysts. We further unveil connections between finite-size catalysis and multi-copy transformations. Notably, we discover a fascinating phenomenon of catalytic resonance: by carefully tailoring the catalysts's state, one can drastically reduce the required dimension of the catalyst, thus enabling efficient catalytic transformations with minimal resources. Finally, we illustrate our findings with examples from the resource theories of entanglement and thermodynamics, as well in the context of catalytic unitary transformations.</description>

      <title>Rotational-state dependence of interactions between polar molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Scheme for Deterministic Loading of Laser-Cooled Molecules into Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Fluorescence spectra of the $8P_{J} \rightarrow 6P_{J'}$ ($J$ and $J'$ = 3/2, 1/2) electric quadrupole transition of cesium atoms have been observed with a heated cesium vapor cell. We determined the ratio of the transition probabilities of $8P_{J}\rightarrow6P_{J'}$ to $8P_{J}\rightarrow5D_{3/2}$ by comparing their respective photon emission rates. The results are in good agreement with our theoretical calculations. These measurements provide crucial parameters for tests of coherent amplification method and improve knowledge of cesium properties which are essential to dark matter detection through atomic transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.09229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present undergraduate-friendly instructions on how to produce light pulses propagating through warm Rubidium vapor with speeds less than 400 m/s, i.e., nearly a million times slower than c. We elucidate the role played by electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in producing slow light pulses, and discuss how to achieve the required experimental conditions. The optical set up is presented, and details provided for preparation of pump, probe, and reference pulses of the required size, frequency, intensity, temporal width, and polarization purity. EIT-based slow light pulses provide the most widely studied architecture for creating quantum memories. Therefore, the basic concepts presented here are useful for physics and engineering majors who wish to get involved in the development of cutting-edge quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly diffusing atoms confined in a dissipative optical lattice are illuminated by a weak probe of light. The probe transmission spectrum reveals directed atomic propagation that occurs perpendicular to the direction of probe beam propagation. Resonant enhancement of this directed propagation is observed as we vary the random photon scattering rate. We experimentally characterize this stochastic resonance as a function of probe intensity and lattice well depth. A simple model reveals how the probe-excited atomic density waves and optical pumping rates conspire to create directed atomic propagation within a randomly diffusing sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Catalysis plays a key role in many scientific areas, most notably in chemistry and biology. Here we present a catalytic process in a paradigmatic quantum optics setup, namely the Jaynes-Cummings model, where an atom interacts with an optical cavity. The atom plays the role of the catalyst, and allows for the deterministic generation of non-classical light in the cavity. Considering a cavity prepared in a ``classical'' coherent state, and choosing appropriately the atomic state and the interaction time, we obtain an evolution with the following properties. First, the state of the cavity has been modified, and now features non-classicality, as witnessed by sub-Poissonian statistics or Wigner negativity. Second, the process is catalytic, in the sense that the atom is deterministically returned to its initial state exactly, and can be re-used multiple times. What is more, we also show that our findings are robust under dissipation and can be applied to scenarios featuring cavity loss and atomic decay. Finally, we investigate the mechanism of this catalytic process, in particular highlighting the key role of correlations and quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Spatial quasiperiodic driving of a dissipative optical lattice and origin of directed Brillouin modes in a randomly diffusing cold atom cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms confined in a three-dimensional dissipative optical lattice oscillate inside potential wells, occasionally hopping to adjacent wells, thereby diffusing in all directions. Illumination by a weak probe beam modulates the lattice, yielding propagating atomic density waves, referred to as Brillouin modes which travel perpendicular to the direction of travel of the probe. The probe is made incident at a small angle relative to a lattice symmetry axis, yielding a driving potential perturbation whose spatial period is not a multiple of the period of the underlying optical potential, thus enabling exploration of the regime of space quasiperiodic drive. A theory, based on the Fourier decomposition of the current into its atomic density wave contributions, reveals that unlike the previously studied time quasiperiodic case, wherein a lattice driven by two incommensurate frequencies may exhibit abrupt suppression in directed current as the driving transitions from quasiperiodic to periodic, a spatial-quasiperiodically driven lattice exhibits no such abrupt response. Further, detailed modeling of spatial-quasiperiodically driven lattices reveals that directed propagation occurs not only as a consequence of velocity-matching between the propagating modulation and the average velocity of the atom oscillating inside a well as was previously reported in the literature, but also as a distinct consequence of a new mechanism, namely, frequency-matching between the modulation frequency and the oscillation frequencies. A systematic measurement of the transmitted probe spectra as a function of off-axis probe angle is presented, which is consistent with the velocity- and frequency-matching predictions from the detailed model.</description>

      <title>Violation of the equivalence principle induced by oscillating rest mass and transition frequency, and its detection in atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the expected experimental signals produced by freely falling atoms with time oscillating mass and transition frequency. These oscillations could be produced in a variety of models, in particular, models of scalar dark matter (DM) non universally coupled to the standard matter (SM) such as axion-like particles (ALP) and dilatons. Performing complete and rigorous calculations, we show that, on one hand, two different atomic species would accelerate at a different rate, and on the other hand, they would produce a non-zero differential phase shift in atom interferometers (AI). The former would produce observable signals in equivalence principle tests like the recent MICROSCOPE mission, and we provide a corresponding sensitivity estimate, showing that MICROSCOPE can reach beyond the best existing searches in the ALP case. We also compare the expected sensitivity of two future AI experiments, namely the AION-10 gradiometer and an isotope differential AI considered for MAGIS-100, that we will refer to as SPID. We show that the SPID setup would be more sensitive to these dark matter fields compared to the gradiometer one, assuming equivalent experimental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider an effective theory for a shift-symmetric, quadratically-coupled, ultralight spin-0 field. The leading CP-conserving interactions with Standard Model fields in the effective theory arise at dimension 8. We discuss the renormalization group evolution and positivity bounds on these operators, as well as their possible UV origins. Assuming that the spin-0 field is associated with an ultralight dark matter candidate, we discuss the effects of the dimension-8 operators on experiments searching for the oscillation of fundamental constants and Lorentz violation. We find that the direct bounds on these two effects are of similar strength but rather weak, corresponding to a UV cutoff scale of keV order, as they are mediated by dimension-8 operators.</description>
