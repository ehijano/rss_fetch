      <title>Is Earendel a Star?: Investigating the Sunrise Arc Using JWST Strong and Weak Gravitational Lensing Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster WHL J013719.8-08284 at $z = 0.566$ exhibits a strong-lensing feature known as the Sunrise Arc, which hosts the candidate star Earendel at $z \approx 6.2$, the most distant star candidate observed to date. If this object is a star, or a system of a few stars, its apparent magnitude implies both extreme gravitational lensing magnification and unusually high luminosity. This study revisits Earendel's magnification, which, in previous literature, exhibits significant uncertainty across various lens models ($2\mu = 4{,}000$-$35{,}000$). We present an improved cluster mass reconstruction and a tighter constraint on Earendel's magnification using a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis with JWST data. Our strong-lensing mass model, incorporating newly identified multiple-image systems from JWST imaging data and modifying the existing multiple-image assignment scheme, produces a root-mean-square (RMS) lens-plane scatter of less than $0.''3$. Additionally, our weak-lensing catalog achieves a source density of $\sim 100$ galaxies arcmin$^{-2}$, providing constraints on the mass profile beyond the strong-lensing regime. In our best-fit model, we estimate the magnification of Earendel to be $\mu = 43$-$67$, significantly lower than previously proposed and thus calling into question its classification as a star.</description>

      <title>ALMACAL XIV: X-Shooter Spectroscopy, Infrared Properties and Radio SEDs of Calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMACAL-22 survey includes over 2700 hours of observations of ALMA phase and amplitude calibrators, spanning frequencies from 84 to 950 GHz across bands 3 to 10. In total, 687 out of the 1,047 calibrators have redshifts confirmed with spectroscopy and we find an additional 50 featureless blazars. The redshift distribution of the ALMACAL-22 sample peaks at $z \approx 1$ and spans a wide range, from the nuclei of nearby galaxies at $z \ll 0.01$ to quasars at $z = 3.742$. 70 new VLT/X-Shooter spectra of these sources covering UV to NIR wavelengths are also presented, which will be used in future stacking experiments to search for cold gas in the circumgalactic medium. Infrared magnitudes from WISE indicate that the majority of the sources are consistent with being quasars or blazars. After fitting the radio spectral energy distributions of the calibrators, we find that most ALMA calibrators exhibit peaked spectra or are re-triggered which is surprising given the large number of blazars in the sample. The peak frequencies span three orders of magnitude from 100 MHz to 170 GHz, corresponding to linear sizes ranging from sub-pc to $&gt;$ 10 kpc. In the future, when combined with high-resolution radio imaging, these results will offer valuable constraints on the molecular gas content of the CGM, as well as the ages and duty cycles of AGN jets. The ever-growing ALMACAL data set will remain an indispensable resource for studying the various aspects of galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>AGN Feedback-Induced Stellar Density Expansion in the Inner Regions of Early-Type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations indicate that early-type galaxies exhibit varying slopes in the relation between their central stellar surface density and stellar mass ($\Sigma_1 - M_{\star}$). Low-mass galaxies tend to follow a steep slope, close to one, while the slope flattens for high-mass early type galaxies. In our study, we investigate the $\Sigma_1 - M_{\star}$ scaling relation and its evolution using the NIHAO suite of cosmological simulations and compare our findings with recent results from the MaNGA survey. Our analysis shows that NIHAO galaxies successfully reproduce the observed scaling relation based on MANGA survey. Our analysis suggests that AGN feedback plays a critical role in flattening the $\Sigma_1$ slope by expelling gas from galactic centers, leading to a decrease in both stellar and dark matter density as the gravitational potential becomes shallower. To further support our findings, we conducted high-resolution N-body simulations, which confirmed that
  ({\it sudden}) gas removal does substantially alter the stellar density in the central region, consistent with results from NIHAO. Furthermore, our numerical experiments show that even if the same amount of gas is re-accreted on a typical ({\it longer}) free-fall time, it is not able to restore the original stellar density. Our study concludes that AGN feedback assisted gas removal presents a plausible explanation for the decline in central stellar surface density as observed in massive elliptical galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gas properties as a function of environment in the proto-supercluster Hyperion at z ~ 2.45</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic star-formation rate density, molecular gas density and the AGN activity of the Universe peak at z~ 2-3, showing the Universe is most active at this epoch. The nature of the galaxies at these redshifts and their properties as a function of their environment are particularly interesting to understand the mechanisms driving their star-formation and quenching. At z~ 2.5, a massive (~ 4.8 X 10^15 Msun) proto-supercluster, Hyperion, was identified Cucciati et al. 2018, consisting of 7 groups/peaks and extending over a comoving volume of 60 X 60 X 150 Mpc^3, providing an excellent laboratory to probe the properties and evolution of galaxies as a function of their environments. We use a large compilation of photometric (optical to radio wavelengths, COSMOS2020, COSMOS-Super-deblended, and, A3COSMOS) and spectroscopic (C3VO, HST-Hyperion, VUDS, zCOSMOS, DEIMOS10K, MAGAZ3NE) data to assign membership and study the relation between the local environment and the molecular gas mass, the star-formation rate (SFR), gas depletion timescales, and quenching mechanisms. We find that the depletion timescales and the molecular gas fractions decrease and SFR increases in denser environments at the ~ 2 sigma level, suggesting accelerated evolution in the densest regions of this proto-supercluster resulting from gas stripping, over-consumption, and/or cessation of cold flows. Dedicated observations at sub-millimeter wavelengths enabling further spectroscopic confirmation and better coverage in the sub-millimetric (sub-mm) wavelengths can provide more conclusive results on the environmental implications on gas reservoirs of galaxies in Hyperion.</description>

      <title>The response of warm absorbers to the variations in the ionizing continuum in the active galaxy NGC4051</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the response of warm absorbers to variations in the ionizing continuum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using time-resolved X-ray observations from the \textit{Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer} (\textit{NICER}). In this work, we have demonstrated we can perform time-resolved spectroscopic studies of warm absorbers of about $\sim 5500$ s time resolution using NICER data. We have extracted 15 spectra for this source, corresponding to 15 different visits to the source, or pointings, each separated by a longer Earth occultation. By modeling the spectral variability of the warm absorber with the \texttt{{\sc {\sc warmabs}}} analytic model, we detect significant variations in the ionization parameter that correlate with changes in the ionizing flux. A time lag of approximately 5500 seconds is observed between the flux variations and the absorber's ionization response, suggesting that the gas is out of photoionization equilibrium during these periods. Using this time lag, we estimate the lower limit of the gas density $8.91 \times 10^6 \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ and constrain the location of the warm absorber to within $7.02 \times 10^{16} \, \text{cm}$ ($\sim 0.02$ parsec) from the central black hole. This study uses time-resolved spectral analysis to contribute to our understanding of the physical conditions of ionized AGN outflows, such as density and location.</description>

      <title>The Chemical Evolution of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals -- heavy elements synthesized during various phases of stellar evolution or during supernova explosions -- play a fundamental role in shaping galaxy evolution. In fact, their relative abundances, spatial distribution, and scaling with galactic properties reflect the constant interplay between star-formation, nucleosynthesis, and gas flows that drive the cycle of baryons in-and-out of galaxies across the cosmic time. This chapter aims at offering a concise introduction to the methodologies used to measure elemental abundances in galaxies and the basics of chemical evolution modeling. We also provide a brief overview of the current observational framework, including metallicity scaling relations, the study of relative chemical abundances, the distribution of metals within and beyond galaxies, and how these properties evolve with redshift, drawing on both extensive literature and recent developments, and aiming to highlight well-established findings alongside ongoing challenges in this rapidly advancing field.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C\,{\tiny II}] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shells in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H\,{\tiny II} region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H\,{\tiny II} regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C\,{\tiny II}] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H\,{\tiny II} region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C\,{\tiny II}] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C\,{\tiny II}] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C\,{\tiny II}] emission and a low ratio of [C\,{\tiny II}] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C\,{\tiny II}] flux and find a linear correlation between [C\,{\tiny II}] and FIR without a [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C\,{\tiny II}]-deficit found in Galactic H\,{\tiny II} bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic Orbits: A Practical Implementation of Lynden-Bell's Planar Orbits and Extension to Vertical Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical implementation of the perturbation theory derived by Lynden-Bell (2015) for describing, to arbitrary precision, the orbit of a particle in an arbitrary spherically-symmetric potential. Our implementation corrects minor but important errors in the initial derivation, and extends the formalism in two ways. First, a numerical method is developed to efficiently and precisely solve the analogue to the Kepler problem, and second, a method is introduced to track the particle's vertical oscillations about an axisymmetric disk, even when the vertical oscillation frequency varies with radius. While not as flexible as numerical integration, this method guarantees conservation of energy, angular momentum, and related quantities, and may be used to evaluate a particle's position and velocity in constant time. Our implementation is written in Python and is pip installable as the package lbparticles.</description>

      <title>The X-ray statistical properties of dust-obscured galaxies detected by eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are considered to be in a co-evolution phase, with the associated active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dust and gas. Although the DOGs are thought to harbor rapidly growing SMBHs, their X-ray statistical properties, crucial for understanding the properties of obscuring gas as well as the accretion disk state and the hot electron corona around the SMBHs, remain unexplored due to the combination of the low number density of DOGs and the lack of X-ray surveys achieving both of the wide-area and uniformly high-sensitivity observations. We construct a sample of X-ray-detected DOGs in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field and examine their X-ray statistical properties. By using Subaru/HSC SSP, VIKING, and WISE all-sky surveys, our results reveal the discovery of 5738 IR-bright DOGs in the footprint covered by both of the eFEDS and VIKING surveys (60 deg^2), with 65 objects identified as X-ray-detected DOGs (eFEDS-DOGs). Among them, 41 eFEDS-DOGs show a power-law slope in the near to mid-IR bands (power-law DOGs), indicating dust-obscured AGN. The hydrogen column density (N_H) suggests that eFEDS-DOGs cover even unobscured AGN, spanning 10^20 &lt; N_H &lt;= 10^23. On the other hand, the majority of IR-bright DOGs are not detected by eROSITA, suggesting that most IR-bright DOGs are heavily obscured by dust and gas with N_H &gt; 10^23. Therefore, eFEDS-DOGs, discovered thanks to the wide-area survey by eROSITA, are newly found populations showing less obscured phases among the lifetime of DOGs. Additionally, some eFEDS-DOGs exhibit deviations, down to nearly 1.0 dex below the monochromatic luminosity at 6 micron versus absorption-corrected intrinsic X-ray luminosity between 0.5-2 keV relation, suggesting that it may signal high Eddington ratios reaching the Eddington limit.</description>

      <title>Radio AGN selection in LoTSS DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide-area component of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is currently the largest radio survey ever carried out, and a large fraction of the 4.5 million radio sources it contains have been optically identified with galaxies or quasars with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. Identification of radio-luminous AGN from this LoTSS source catalogue is not only important from the point of view of understanding the accretion history of the universe, but also enables a wide range of other science. However, at present the vast majority of the optical identifications lack spectroscopic information or well-sampled spectral energy distributions. We show that colour and absolute magnitude information from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) allows for the robust and efficient selection of radio AGN candidates, generating a radio AGN candidate sample of around 600,000 objects with flux density $&gt; 1.1$ mJy, spanning 144-MHz luminosities between $10^{21}$ and $10^{29}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. We use the catalogue to constrain the total sky density of radio-luminous AGN and the evolution of their luminosity function between $z=0$ and $z\approx 1$, and show that the typical mass of their host galaxies, around $10^{11} M_\odot$, is essentially independent of radio luminosity above around $L_{144} \approx 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Combining with Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) data, we show that the core prominences, radio spectral indices and variability of extended sources from the sample are qualitatively consistent with the expectations from unified models. A catalogue of the radio AGN candidates is released with this paper.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a high-velocity cloud of the Milky Way as a potential dark galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are composed of neutral hydrogen (HI) moving at velocities that deviate from the general rotational motion of the Milky Way. Currently, the origins of the HVCs remain poorly known due to the difficulty in determining their distance and the lack of any other suitable identification. Here we report the detection of a compact gas clump in HVC AC-I, which displays characteristics typical of a disk galaxy, named AC G185.0-11.5, using the HI observations. We estimated the distance of AC G185.0-11.5 to be about 277.7 kpc using the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and constrained its HI gas mass to be between 3.0*10^7 and 4.7*10^8 solar masses. The distance determination indicates that the HVC AC-I hosting AC G185.0-11.5 is an extragalactic object in the Local Group. The absence of molecular gas and an optical counterpart for AC G185.0-11.5 implies that it may be a rare dark galaxy.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the formation paths of massive compact ETGs through their internal dynamical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are thought to form in two phases: an initial phase of rapid star formation and a later phase of mergers. A small fraction of these galaxies, called red nuggets, formed during the first phase may have survived frozen until today, experiencing no massive mergers since z~2. Nearby massive compact ETGs are considered candidates for such relic galaxies. We study the internal dynamical structures of 15 compact ETGs with existing integral field unit (IFU) observations and 79 compact ETGs from the TNG50 simulation. We dynamically decompose each galaxy into a disk, bulge, and hot inner stellar halo, for both observations and simulations. In TNG50, the luminosity fraction of the hot inner stellar halo (or the size of the spheroid, which includes the bulge and halo) strongly correlates with the galaxy merger history. The true merger-free galaxies show an extremely low fraction of a hot inner stellar halo (or an extremely compact spheroid). Although such compactness could result from the tidal stripping of satellites, tidal forces would also destroy the dynamically cold disk (if one exists) when the halo is removed. Thus, a galaxy is guaranteed to be merger-free if it has a very low fraction of the hot inner stellar halo and retains a dynamically cold disk. Comparing observed galaxies with TNG50, we identify 7 of the 15 compact ETGs, PGC 11179, UGC 3816, NGC 2767, NGC 1277, PGC 32873, PGC 12562, and PGC 70520, as true merger-free galaxies. These galaxies have compact, massive bulges, likely formed through secular heating, as supported by their TNG50 analogues.</description>

      <title>Modeling Local Bubble analogs II: Synthetic Faraday rotation maps</title>

Abstract: Faraday rotation describes the change of the linear polarization angle of radiation passing through a magnetized plasma and it is quantified by the rotation measure (RM), which is related to the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field component and the thermal electron density traversed by light along its path toward the observer. However, it is challenging to disentangle the signal from different LOS portions and separate the contribution from the local ISM. This is particularly relevant since the Sun is located within the Local Bubble (LB), a low-density and hot cavity formed by past SN events, making it essential to investigate how this environment may influence the observed RM values. The present study investigates the imprint of the local environment on the synthetic RM signal, as measured by an observer within a LB-like cavity. The RM derived from diffuse polarized synchrotron radiation produced by CR electrons at decimeter wavelengths is also analyzed. We produce synthetic RM maps for an observer placed inside a LB candidate, selected from a MHD simulation that resembles the properties of the ISM in the Solar vicinity. Using the capabilities of the radiative transfer code POLARIS, we study the imprint of the cavity walls on the RM signal. As the MHD simulation does not account for CR diffusion, we develop a CR toy-model to study the Faraday rotation of the diffuse polarized synchrotron radiation. We find that (i) the imprint of local structures, such as the walls of the LB candidate and the edges of other supernovae blown cavities, is of fundamental importance for interpreting the global Faraday sky; (ii) the LB has a non negligible contribution to the sinusoidal patterns of RM as a function of Galactic longitude seen in observations; and (iii) the RM signal from diffuse synchrotron emission shows a strong correspondence with the RM signal generated by the LB candidate walls.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT -- XVI. Mapping the Galactic magnetic field with pulsar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the magnetic field of the Milky Way reveals the structure and evolution of the galaxy. Pulsar rotation measures (RMs) provide a means to probe this Galactic magnetic field (GMF) in three dimensions. We use the largest single-origin data set of pulsar measurements, from the MeerKAT Thousand-Pulsar-Array, to map out GMF components parallel to pulsar lines of sight. We also present these measurements for easy integration into the consolidated RM catalogue, RMTable. Focusing on the Galactic disk, we investigate competing theories of how the GMF relates to the spiral arms, comparing our observational map with five analytic models of magnetic field structure. We also analyse RMs to extragalactic radio sources, to help build up a three-dimensional picture of the magnetic structure of the galaxy. In particular, our large number of measurements allows us to investigate differing magnetic field behaviour in the upper and lower halves of the Galactic plane. We find that the GMF is best explained as following the spiral arms in a roughly bisymmetric structure, with antisymmetric parity with respect to the Galactic plane. This picture is complicated by variations in parity on different spiral arms, and the parity change location appears to be shifted by a distance of 0.15 kpc perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This indicates a complex relationship between the large-scale distributions of matter and magnetic fields in our galaxy. Future pulsar discoveries will help reveal the origins of this relationship with greater precision, as well as probing the locations of local magnetic field inhomogenities.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the drivers of the Baryon Cycles with Interpretable Multi-step Machine Learning and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for understanding how galaxies lose or retain baryons by utilizing a pipeline of two machine learning methods applied the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. We employed a Random Forest Regressor and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model to connect the retained baryon fraction of $\approx10^5$ simulated galaxies to their properties. We employed Random Forest models to filter and used the five most significant properties to train an EBM. Interaction functions identified by the EBM highlight the relationship between baryon fraction and three different galactic mass measurements, the location of the rotation curve peak, and the velocity dispersion. This interpretable machine learning-based approach provides a promising pathway for understanding the baryon cycle in galaxies.</description>

      <title>SDSS J134313.15+364457.5: Forming Compact Elliptical through the Merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling relations are fundamental tools for exploring the morphological properties of galaxies and understanding their formation and evolution. Typically, galaxies follow a scaling relation between mass and size, measured by effective radius. However, a compact class of galaxies exists as outliers from this relation, and the origin of these compact galaxies in the local universe remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the compact dwarf galaxy SDSS J134313.15+364457.5 (J1343+3644), which is the result of a merger. Our analysis reveals that J1343+3644 has a half-light radius of 482~pc, significantly smaller than typical galaxies with the same brightness ($M_\text{r} = -19.17$ mag). With a high star-formation rate (SFR) of 0.87~M$_{\sun}$ year$^{-1}$, J1343+3644 is expected to evolve into a compact elliptical galaxy in a few million years. J1343+3644 could, therefore, be a progenitor of a compact elliptical galaxy. The phenomenon happened in early universe, where compact galaxies were common.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Project MOBStIRS: Parametrizing Infrared Stellar-Wind Bow Shock Morphologies with Citizen Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass-loss influences stellar evolution, especially for massive stars with strong winds. Stellar wind bow shock nebulae driven by Galactic OB stars can be used to measure mass-loss rates ($\dot{M}$). The standoff distance ($R_{0}$) between the star and the bow shock is set by momentum flux balance between the stellar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). We created the Milky Way Project: MOBStIRS (Mass-loss rates for OB Stars driving IR bow Shocks) using the online Zooniverse citizen science platform. We enlisted several hundred students to measure $R_0$ and two other projected shape parameters for 764 cataloged IR bow shocks. MOBStIRS incorporated 1528 JPEG cutout images produced from Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL survey data. Measurements were aggregated to compute shape parameters for each bow shock image deemed high-quality by participants. The average statistical uncertainty on $R_0$ is $12.5\%$ but varies from ${&lt;}5\%$ to ${\sim}40\%$ among individual bow shocks, contributing significantly to the total error budget of $\dot{M}$. The derived nebular morphologies agree well with (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of bow shocks driven by the winds of OB stars moving at $V_a = 10-40~km~s^{-1}$ with respect to the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). A systematic correction to $R_0$ to account for viewing angle appears unnecessary for computing $\dot{M}$. Slightly more than half of MOBStIRS bow shocks are asymmetric, which could indicate anisotropic stellar winds, ISM clumping on sub-pc scales, time-dependent instabilities, and/or misalignments between the local ISM magnetic field and the star-bow shock axis.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Palomar 5 Stream: HDBSCAN Analysis and Galactic Halo Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10 to investigate the previously undetected faint extension of the Palomar 5 stellar stream. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, we identify stream members and successfully extend the leading arm of the stream to approximately $\mathrm{DEC} \sim -15^\circ$. Combining the fully detected stream with a suite of mock stream simulations, we conduct a detailed comparison to constrain both the intrinsic properties of the stream and the dynamical parameters of the Milky Way (MW) halo. Our analysis yields a best-fit model characterized by eight parameters: $M_{\mathrm{halo}} = 5.67\times10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$, $r_{s,\mathrm{halo}} = 28.94\ \mathrm{kpc}$, $q_z = 0.93$, $M_{\mathrm{gc}} = 4.31\times10^{3}\ M_{\odot}$, $dM_{\mathrm{gc}}/dt = 1.81\ M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, $\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta = -2.28\ \mathrm{mas\ yr}^{-1}$, $\mu_{\delta} = -2.26\ \mathrm{mas\ yr}^{-1}$, and $D = 23.25\ \mathrm{kpc}$. Notably, our constraints on the halo shape indicate that the MW's dark matter halo exhibits a flattened potential, with a minor-to-major axis ratio of $q_z = 0.93$. This finding aligns well with theoretical expectations and previous observational estimates. Additionally, the best-fit model accurately reproduces the observed stream morphology and dynamics, providing a more precise understanding of both the evolution of the stream and the overall structure of the Galactic halo.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an intriguing chemically rich outflow in the OMC-2/3 filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying chemically rich protostellar outflows and their jet provides an important insight into the low-mass star formation process and its related chemistry. Whilst well-known shock tracers such as SiO can be used to study the jet properties and give information about the dynamics of the system, interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) have been useful in constraining the age of shocked gas, for example. Yet, the number of outflows mapped in iCOMs is still limited. In this work, we study the outflow driven by the protostar FIR6c-a (HOPS 409) located in the OMC-2/3 filament. We report the detection of the red-shifted jet, left undetected in previous studies, as well as the detection of the iCOMs methanol (CH$_3$OH) and methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) for the first time towards this outflow. Using SiO, we derived some jet properties (i.e., collimation and dynamical time). We found a clear dichotomy between the blue- and red-shifted jets, likely due to the density of the medium in which the jets propagate. In addition, we identified two bow shocks within the blue-shifted part of the outflow, which we attribute to two different ejection events. Finally, using the CH$_3$OH} and \ce{CH$_3$CN} abundance ratio and chemical modelling, we constrained the outflow age to be $\geq 1000$ yr old and, surprisingly, found that a cosmic-ray ionization rate of $10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ is needed to reproduce the observed ratio towards the source.</description>

      <title>Estimating the dense gas mass of molecular clouds using spatially unresolved 3 mm line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to develop a new method to infer the sub-beam probability density function (PDF) of H2 column densities and the dense gas mass within molecular clouds using spatially unresolved observations of molecular emission lines in the 3 mm band. We model spatially unresolved line integrated intensity measurements as the average of an emission function weighted by the sub-beam column density PDF. The emission function, which expresses the line integrated intensity as a function of the gas column density, is an empirical fit to high resolution (&lt; 0.05 pc) multi-line observations of the Orion B molecular cloud. The column density PDF is assumed to be parametric, composed of a lognormal distribution at moderate column densities and a power law distribution at higher column densities. To estimate the sub-beam column density PDF, the emission model is combined with a Bayesian inversion algorithm (the Beetroots code), which takes account of thermal noise and calibration errors. We validate our method by demonstrating that it recovers the true column density PDF of the Orion B cloud, reproducing the observed emission line integrated intensities. We apply the method to 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), C18O(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0), HCO+(J=1-0) and N2H+(J=1-0) observations of a 700 x 700 pc2 field of view (FoV) in the nearby galaxy M51. On average, the model reproduces the observed intensities within 30%. The column density PDFs obtained for the spiral arm region within our test FoV are dominated by a power-law tail at high column densities, with slopes that are consistent with gravitational collapse. Outside the spiral arm, the column density PDFs are predominantly lognormal, consistent with supersonic isothermal turbulence. We calculate the mass associated with the powerlaw tail of the column density PDFs and observe a strong, linear correlation between this mass and the 24$\mu$m surface brightness.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations between X-ray clusters and the general galaxy population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents highly precise measurements of the cross-correlation between volume-limited galaxy samples from the DESI legacy survey catalogue and X-ray selected galaxy clusters from eROSITA, allowing for detailed analysis across redshift and color. Two key findings emerge. First, the cluster-galaxy cross-correlation, when split into quiescent and star-forming galaxies, contains significant information about the infall, feedback, and quenching processes of blue cloud galaxies in massive environments. These results align well with existing galaxy evolution models for higher stellar masses ($\log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot]) &gt; 10.75$), though the red fraction may be slightly underestimated in the intermediate mass range ($10.25 &lt; \log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot])&lt; 10.75$). Second, the integral of the cross-correlation within 500 kpc enables a model-independent measurement of the red sequence and its scatter in clusters, providing a robust alternative to existing red-sequence calibration methods without requiring spectroscopic redshifts or classifications of galaxies. Similar analyses on upcoming photometric surveys as Euclid and LSST together with spectroscopic samples like 4MOST and DESI should lead to a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio and in particular at small separations.</description>

      <title>How well can we unravel the accreted constituents of the Milky Way stellar halo? A test on cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. One of the primary goals of Galactic Archaeology is to reconstruct the Milky Way's accretion history. To achieve this, significant efforts have been dedicated to identifying signatures of past accretion events. In particular, the study of integrals-of-motion (IoM) space has proven to be highly insightful for uncovering these ancient mergers and understanding their impact on the Galaxy's evolution.
  Aims. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art method for detecting debris from accreted galaxies, by testing it on four Milky Way-like galaxies from the Auriga suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations.
  Methods. We employ the innovative method from L\"ovdal et al. (2022) to identify substructures in the integrals-of-motion space within the local stellar halos of the four simulated galaxies. This approach enables us to evaluate the method's performance by comparing the properties of the identified clusters with the known populations of accreted galaxies in the simulations. Additionally, we investigate whether incorporating chemical abundances and stellar age information can help to link distinct structures originating from the same accretion event.
  Results. This method is very effective in detecting debris from accretion events that occur less than 6-7 Gyr ago but struggles to detect most of the debris from older accretion. Furthermore, most of the detected structures suffer from significant contamination by in-situ stars. Our results also show that the method may also generate artificial detections.
  Conclusions. Our work show that the Milky Way's accretion history remains uncertain, and question the reality of some detected structures in the Solar vicinity.</description>

      <title>Non zero Coriolis field in Ehlers' Frame Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ehlers' Frame Theory is a class of geometric theories parameterized by $\lambda := 1/c^2$ and identical to the General Theory of Relativity for $\lambda \neq 0$. The limit $\lambda \to 0$ does not recover Newtonian gravity, as one might expect, but yields the so-called Newton-Cartan theory of gravity, which is characterized by a second gravitational field $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, called the Coriolis field. Such a field encodes at a non-relativistic level the dragging feature of general spacetimes, as we show explicitly for the case of the $(\eta,H)$ geometries. Taking advantage of the Coriolis field, we apply Ehlers' theory to an axially symmetric distribution of matter, mimicking, for example, a disc galaxy, and show how its dynamics might reproduce a flattish rotation curve. In the same setting, we further exploit the formal simplicity of Ehlers' formalism in addressing non-stationary cases, which are remarkably difficult to be treated in the General Theory of Relativity. We show that the time derivative of the Coriolis field gives rise to a tangential acceleration which allows to study a possible formation in time of the rotation curve's flattish feature.</description>

      <title>The infrared counterpart and proper motion of magnetar SGR0501+4516</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) are highly magnetised neutron stars (magnetars) notable for their gamma-ray and X-ray outbursts. In this paper, we use near-infrared (NIR) imaging of SGR 0501+4516 in the days, weeks, and years after its 2008 outburst to characterise the multi-wavelength emission, and to obtain a proper motion from our long temporal baseline observations. Unlike most magnetars, the source has only moderate foreground extinction with minimal crowding. Our observations began only 2 hours after the first activation of SGR 0501+4516 in August 2008, and continued for 4 years, including two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. The proper motion constraint is improved by a third HST epoch 10 years later. The near-infrared and X-rays faded slowly during the first week, thereafter following a steeper power-law decay. The behaviour is satisfactorily fit by a broken power-law. Three epochs of HST imaging with a 10-year baseline allow us to determine a quiescent level, and to measure a proper motion of 5.4+/-0.6 mas/yr. This corresponds to a low transverse peculiar velocity of 51+/-14 km/s (at 2 kpc). The magnitude and direction of the proper motion rules out supernova remnant HB9 as the birth-site. We can find no other supernova remnants or groups of massive stars within the region traversed by SGR 0501+4516 during its characteristic lifetime (20 kyr). Our observations of SGR 0501+4516 suggest that some magnetars may be either significantly older than expected, that their progenitors produce low supernova ejecta masses, or alternatively that they can be formed through accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or low-mass neutron star mergers. Although the progenitor of SGR 0501+4516 remains unclear, we propose that SGR 0501+4516 is the best Galactic candidate for a magnetar formed through a mechanism other than massive star core-collapse.</description>

      <title>The Complete Sample of Available SNe Ia Luminosity Calibrations from the TRGB Observed with either HST or JWST</title>

Abstract: Distance ladders which calibrate the luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) currently provide the strongest constraints on the local value of H0. Recent studies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) show good consistency between measurements of SNe Ia host distances. These are calibrated to NGC 4258 using different primary distance indicators (Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch, and Miras). However, some sub-samples of calibrated SNe Ia employed to measure H0 yield noteworthy differences due to small sample statistics but also due to differences in sample selection. This issue is particularly important for TRGB-derived calibrations owing to the smaller volume they reach compared to Cepheids, reducing sample size and enhancing the size of statistical fluctuations. To mitigate this issue, we compile the largest and complete (as currently available) sample of HST or JWST measurements of the TRGB in the hosts of normal SNe Ia for a total of N=35, 50% larger than the previous largest. Most are present in the literature, and we compile multiple measures when available. We also add 5 SNe Ia hosts from the HST archive not previously published. The full sample together with the Pantheon+ SN catalog gives H0=72.1-73.3 +/- 1.8 km/s/Mpc (depending on methodology), in good agreement with the value of 72.5 +/- 1.5 km/s/Mpc from HST Cepheids in hosts of 42 SNe Ia calibrated by the same anchor, NGC 4258. We trace the difference in the result of H0=70.4 +/- 1.9 km/s/Mpc from Freedman et al. 2025 to 11 hosts not selected for that CCHP compilation (of N=24) which alone yield H0=74.1 km/s/Mpc, 2$\sigma$ higher than the selected sample. A smaller increase of 0.6 km/s/Mpc comes from a commonly employed correction for peculiar velocities.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of BH-ULX candidates: An `unusual' $L_{\rm disc}$-$T_{\rm col}$ correlation associated with spectral states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the long-term spectral evolution of eight black hole ultra-luminous X-ray sources (BH-ULXs), namely NGC1313 X-1, NGC5408 X-1, NGC6946 X-1, IC342 X-1, NGC55 ULX1, NGC4395 ULX1, NGC5204 X-1 and NGC4190 ULX1 using {\it XMM-Newton} monitoring data spanning over a decade or more. An in-depth spectral modeling with thermal Comptonization ({\it nthComp}) and standard disc ({\it diskbb}) components reveals NGC5204 X-1, IC342 X-1, NGC4190 ULX1 and NGC1313 X-1 exhibiting harder spectral characteristics with dominant effect of Comptonization ($F_{nth}&gt;F_{disc}$, $\Gamma_{nth}\lesssim2$). However, NGC6946 X-1 and NGC55 ULX1 remain in a disc-dominated state ($F_{disc}\sim2F_{nth}$, $\Gamma_{nth}\gtrsim2$), while NGC5408 X-1 shows intermediate spectral characteristics. The spectral analyses indicate an anti-correlation between disc luminosity ($L_{disc}$) and temperature ($T_{col}$) for all sources except NGC5204 X-1. These anti-correlations follow a relation $L_{disc}\propto T_{col}^{\alpha}$ with steeper exponents of $\alpha=-6.01\pm0.25$ (NGC55 ULX1), $-8.93\pm0.11$ (NGC6946 X-1), and $-10.31\pm0.10$ (NGC5408 X-1) for sources with softer or intermediate spectral characteristics. For harder sources, NGC1313 X-1 and IC342 X-1, the combined results provide $\alpha=-3.58\pm0.04$. However, for NGC5204 X-1, a positive correlation is found, yielding $\alpha=1.4\pm0.1$, suggesting that the emission mechanism is associated with the transition from the `standard disc' to the `slim disc' scenario. These findings suggest that the observed $L_{disc}-T_{col}$ correlations, along with the overall spectro-temporal properties of BH-ULXs, seems to be governed by disc-corona-wind driven accretion processes at various inclinations. Finally, we report a QPO-like feature ($\sim20$ mHz) with $rms\%\sim6.6$, Q-factor $\sim6.7$ and significant $2.8\sigma$ in NGC55 ULX1.</description>

      <title>Discovery of lambda Boo stars in open clusters</title>

Abstract: The origin of lambda Boo stars is currently unknown. After several efforts by many authors, no bona fide lambda Boo stars have been confirmed as members of open clusters. Their detection could provide an important test bed for a detailed study of lambda Boo stars. Results. For the first time, we present the surprising finding of two lambda Boo stars as members of open clusters: HD 28548 belongs to the cluster HSC 1640 and HD 36726 belongs to the cluster Theia 139. This was confirmed using a detailed abundance analysis, while the cluster membership was independently analyzed using Gaia DR3 data and radial velocities. We compared the lambda Boo star HD 36726 with other cluster members and showed that the lambda Boo star was originally born with a near-solar composition. This also implies one of the highest chemical differences detected between two cluster members (0.5 dex). In addition, we suggest that the lambda Boo peculiarity strongly depletes heavier metals, but could also slightly modify lighter abundances such as C and O. We also found that both lambda Boo stars belong to the periphery of their respective clusters. This would suggest that lambda Boo stars avoid the strong photoevaporation by UV radiation from massive stars in the central regions of the cluster. We preliminarily suggest that peripheral location appears to be a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the development of lambda Boo peculiarity. We also obtained a precise age determination for the lambda Boo stars HD 28548 (26.3 Myr) and HD 36726 (33.1 Myr). Conclusions. We have confirmed, for the first time, that two lambda Boo stars belong to open clusters. This remarkable finding could make open clusters excellent laboratories for studying the origin of lambda Boo stars.</description>

      <title>Physical Parameters of Stars in NGC 6397 Using ANN-Based Interpolation and Full Spectrum Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar spectral interpolation is critical technique employed by fitting software to derive the physical parameters of stars. This approach is necessary because on-the-go generation of synthetic stellar spectra is not possible due to the complex and high cost of computation. The goal of this study is to develop a spectral interpolator for a synthetic spectral library using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The study aims to test the accuracy of the trained interpolator through self-inversion and, subsequently, to utilize the interpolator to derive the physical parameters of stars in the globular cluster NGC 6397 using spectra obtained from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In this study, ANNs were trained to function as spectral interpolators. The ULySS full-spectrum fitting package, integrated with the trained interpolators, was then used to extract the physical parameters of 1587 spectra of 1063 stars in NGC 6397. The trained ANN interpolator achieved precise determination of stellar parameters with a mean difference of 31 K for $T_{\rm eff}$ and 0.01 dex for [Fe/H] compared to previous studies. This study demonstrates the efficacy of ANN-based spectral interpolation in stellar parameter determination, offering faster and more accurate analysis.</description>

      <title>Looking into the Jet Cone of the Neutrino-Associated Very High Energy Blazar PKS 1424+240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration process of massive particles as well as the production of very high energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. We investigate the parsec-scale properties of the blazar PKS 1424+240, that has been selected on the basis of both gamma-ray and neutrino VHE radiation. We analyze VLBA observations of this BL Lac object, stacking 42 polarization-sensitive images collected in 2009-2025 to enhance the signal and reveal persistent parsec-scale structure. Our observations indicate that this object is viewed inside the jet cone, very close to the axis of its relativistic jet, with a viewing angle of &lt;0.6 deg. This effectively maximizes Doppler boosting to values ~30 and enhances both electromagnetic and neutrino emission in the observer's direction. Based on polarimetric observations, we unambiguously detect a net toroidal component of the jet's magnetic field. Blazars with very small jet viewing angles offer a solution to the longstanding mismatch between Doppler factors inferred from VLBI and those derived from VHE observations -- the so-called `Doppler factor crisis'. We show that relativistic beaming plays the critical role in the gamma-ray and neutrino emission of blazars, with direct implications for models of their multi-messenger emission.</description>

      <title>Observing boson stars in binary systems: The case of Gaia BH1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia experiment recently reported the observation of a binary system composed of a Sun-like star orbiting a dark compact object, known as Gaia BH1. The nature of the compact object remains uncertain. While the Gaia mission identifies it as a black hole candidate, the absence of X-ray or radio detections challenges that interpretation, and alternative exotic compact objects such as boson stars have also been suggested. In this paper, we study whether a boson star could account for the observed properties of the source. To do so we compute the X-ray luminosity of the central dark object as a result of spherically symmetric (Bondi-Michel) accretion of matter, comparing our results for the cases in which the dark object is a Schwarzschild black hole or a non rotating boson star. Our model incorporates realistic interstellar medium properties, ranging from hot ionized gas to dense molecular clouds. By solving the governing equations numerically, we calculate mass accretion rates and derive the resulting Bremsstrahlung X-ray luminosities. Black holes and boson stars fundamentally differ by the absence of an event horizon in the latter, which directly impacts accretion dynamics as there is an accumulation of mass in regions closer to the boson star, which will significantly change the observed X-ray emission. For the Gaia BH1 system we find that accretion onto a black hole yields luminosities of $\sim10^{27} \ \text{erg}\, \text{cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$ which corresponds to an X-ray flux undetectable by Chandra sensitivity. On the other hand, boson star accretion can produce observable luminosities in the order of $10^{27} \ \text{to} \ 10^{41} \ \text{erg}\, \text{cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Investigating the emission mechanism in the spatially-resolved jet of two z $\approx$ 3 radio-loud quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on high-redshift, z &gt; 3, quasars where resolved X-ray jets remain underexplored in comparison to nearby sources. Building upon previous work, we identify and confirm extended kpc-scale jets emission in two quasars (J1405+0415, z = 3.215 ; J1610+1811, z = 3.122) through meticulous analysis of Chandra X-ray data. To deepen our understanding, high-resolution radio follow- up observations were conducted to constrain relativistic parameters, providing valuable insights into the enthalpy flux of these high-redshift AGN jets. The investigation specifically aims to test the X-ray emission mechanism in these quasars by exploring the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (IC/CMB) photons by synchrotron-emitting electrons. Our novel method uses a prior to make a Bayesian estimate of the unknown angle of the jet to our line of sight, thus breaking the usual degeneracy of the bulk Lorentz factor and the Doppler beaming factor.</description>

Abstract: We derive analytic dispersion relations for cold, orbitally constrained systems governed by the Vlasov equation. For magnetized plasmas, we obtain the first explicit relation for two-dimensional anisotropic BGK modes with finite magnetic field, showing that only a finite number of angular modes can become unstable and identifying a magnetic-field threshold for stabilization. In the gravitational case, we establish a bound on the growth rate of core perturbations, set by the potential's curvature. These results clarify how orbital constraints shape the spectrum and growth of kinetic instabilities in cold, collisionless media.</description>

      <title>Cosmological zoom-in simulation of fuzzy dark matter down to z = 0: tidal evolution of subhaloes in a Milky Way-sized halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subhaloes are critical in distinguishing dark matter models, yet their evolution within galactic haloes, particularly in the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) model, remains challenging to fully investigate in numerical simulations. In this work, we employ the fluid-wave hybrid scheme recently implemented in the GAMER-2 code to perform a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-sized halo with an FDM particle mass of m = 2 x 10^(-23) eV. It simultaneously resolves the solitonic core of the host halo and tracks the complex tidal evolution of subhaloes down to redshift z = 0. We examine the internal structure of subhaloes by analyzing their density profiles, velocity dispersions, and density power spectra across various redshifts. Our findings show that partially tidally stripped subhaloes deviate from the core-halo mass relation; their solitons remain intact and are enveloped by smaller granules predominantly from the host halo. Furthermore, our simulation unravels a complex tidal evolution of FDM subhaloes. On the one hand, we observe a subhalo core undergoing complete tidal disruption at z ~ 0.14, which later reemerges near the outskirts of the host halo around z ~ 0. This disruption event, characterized by a core contaminated with interference fringes from the host halo's wave function, occurs earlier than previously predicted. On the other hand, FDM subhaloes have denser cores before infall due to the presence of central solitons, making them more resilient to tidal disruption than their N-body counterparts. Our results demonstrate GAMER-2's capability to resolve non-linear FDM substructure down to z = 0, paving the way for future studies of larger FDM subhalo samples with heavier particle masses.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Compactness of High-Redshift Galaxies as a Tracer of Early-Stage Gas Infall, Bursty Star Formation, and Offset from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The empirical anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) at a fixed stellar mass, known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), is commonly interpreted as an equilibrium state in the interplay between gas infall, enrichment, and gas removal. JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy has shown a $z&gt;3$ deviation from the local-universe FMR calibrations, suggesting that these galaxies are potentially caught out of equilibrium. To investigate this, we inferred the stellar population, nebular, and morphological properties of 427 galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;10$ using uniformly reduced NIRSpec prism spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. We consider morphology as a possible indicator of chemical enrichment stage. We find a mass-size relation already in place at $4&lt;z&lt;10$, with a normalization anti-correlated with redshift. The size-redshift anti-correlation depends on stellar mass: while the size of $M_*&lt;10^8M_{\odot}$ galaxies strongly declines with redshift, $M_*&gt;10^9M_{\odot}$ galaxies exhibit negligible redshift evolution. We also confirm the redshift evolution of the FMR: $z&gt;3$ galaxies appear metal-deficient compared to expectations for their stellar mass and SFR according to the local-universe FMR. This offset grows with redshift. Metal deficiency is correlated with compactness: galaxies most offset from the average mass-size relation are also the most metal-poor for their stellar mass and SFR. We interpret this as a product of bursty star formation: compact galaxies exhibit elevated SFR surface densities, indicating that they are observed during burst episodes triggered by gas infall. While accretion of metal-poor gas has reduced their gas-phase metallicity by diluting the interstellar medium, they are observed prior to chemical yield release by newly formed massive stars. Simply, they are chemically out of equilibrium compared to the equilibrium state known as the FMR.</description>

      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies (by $\sim 1$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases) compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

Abstract: The CIELO project introduces a novel set of chemo-dynamical zoom-in simulations designed to simultaneously resolve galaxies and their nearby environments. The initial conditions include a diverse range of cosmic structures, such as local groups, filaments, voids, and walls, allowing for a detailed exploration of galaxies within the broader context of the cosmic web. This study presents the initial conditions and characterizes the global properties of CIELO galaxies and their environments. It focuses on galaxies with stellar masses ranging from log [8,11] solar masses and examines key scaling relations, including the mass-size relation, the Tully-Fisher relation, and the mass-metallicity relation for both stars and star-forming gas. The DisPerSe algorithm was used to determine the positions of CIELO galaxies within the cosmic web, with a specific focus on the Pehuen haloes. The selection of local group volumes was guided by criteria based on the relative positions and velocities of the two primary galaxies. The Pehuen regions were chosen to map walls, filaments, and voids. Synthetic images in the SDSS i, r, and g bands were generated using the SKIRT radiative transfer code. Additionally, a dynamical decomposition was performed to classify galaxy morphologies into bulge, disc, and stellar halo components (abridged).</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>

Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Global survey of star clusters in the Milky Way VIII. Cluster formation and evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider tidal masses and ages of Milky Way open clusters, as well as a simple model of their distribution. Our aim is to investigate the space of model parameters and the correspondence between modelled and observed two-dimensional cluster age-mass distributions. The model for cluster evolution is comprised of a two-section cluster initial mass function, constant cluster formation rate, and a mass loss function. This mass loss function represents a supervirial phase after gas expulsion, mass loss due to stellar evolution, and gradual dissolution driven by internal dynamics and the Galactic tidal field. We construct different estimators of model fitness based on $\chi^2$-statistics, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and a maximum-likelihood approach. Using these estimators and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we obtain best-fit values and posterior distributions for a selection of model parameters. The KLD returns a superior model compared to the other statistics. The cluster initial mass function is well constrained and we find a clear signature of an enhanced cluster mass loss in the first 50 Myr. In the KLD best model, clusters lose 72% of their initial mass in the violent relaxation phase, after which cluster mass loss slows down, allowing for a relatively low rate of cluster formation of $0.088\mathrm{M_\odot kpc^{-2} Gyr^{-1}}$. The observed upper limit of cluster ages at approx. 5 Gyr is reflected in the model by a shallow lifetime-mass relation for clusters with initial masses above $1000\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The application of the model to an independent cluster sample based on Gaia DR3 data yields similar results except for a systematic shift in age. The observed cluster age-mass distribution is compatible with a constant cluster formation rate. The enhanced number of young massive clusters observed requires an early violent relaxation phase of strong mass loss.</description>

      <title>Conditional Autoencoder for Generating Binary Neutron Star Waveforms with Tidal and Precession Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers provide insights into dense matter physics and strong-field gravity, but waveform modeling remains computationally challenging. We develop a deep generative model for gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, covering the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown, incorporating precession and tidal effects. Using a conditional autoencoder, our model efficiently generates waveforms with high fidelity across a broad parameter space, including component masses (m1, m2), spin components (S1x, S1y, S1z, S2x, S2y, S2z), and tidal deformability (Lambda1, Lambda2). Trained on 3e5 waveforms from the IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 waveform model, it achieves an average overlap accuracy of 99.8 percent on the test dataset. The model significantly accelerates waveform generation: for a single sample, it requires 0.12 seconds, compared to 0.38 s for IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 and 0.62 s for IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidal, making it approximately 3 to 5 times faster. When generating 1e3 waveforms, the network completes the task in 0.86 s, while traditional waveform models take over 46-53 s. Our model generates 1e4 waveforms in 7.48 s, achieving a speedup of 60 to 65 times. This speed advantage enables rapid parameter estimation and real-time gravitational wave searches. With higher precision, it will support low-latency detection and broader applications in multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Chaos in violent relaxation dynamics. Disentangling micro- and macro-chaos in numerical experiments of dissipationless collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violent relaxation (VR) is often regarded as the mechanism leading stellar systems to collisionless meta equilibrium via rapid changes in the collective potential. We investigate the role of chaotic instabilities on single particle orbits in leading to nearly-invariant phase-space distributions, aiming at disentangling it from the chaos induced by collective oscillations in the self-consistent potential. We explore as function of the systems size (i.e. number of particles $N$) the chaoticity in terms of the largest Lyapunov exponent of test trajectories in a simplified model of gravitational cold collapse, mimicking a $N-$body calculation via a time dependent smooth potential and a noise-friction process accounting for the discreteness effects. A new numerical method to evaluate effective Lyapunov exponents for stochastic models is presented and tested. We find that the evolution of the phase-space of independent trajectories reproduces rather well what observed in self-consistent $N-$body simulations of dissipationless collapses. The chaoticity of test orbits rapidly decreases with $N$ for particles that remain weakly bounded in the model potential, while it decreases with different power laws for more bound orbits, consistently with what observed in previous self-consistent $N$-body simulations. The largest Lyapunov exponents of ensembles of orbits starting from initial conditions uniformly sampling the accessible phase-space are somewhat constant for $N\lesssim 10^9$, while decreases towards the continuum limit with a power-law trend. Moreover, our numerical results appear to confirm the trend of a specific formulation of dynamical entropy and its relation with Lyapunov time scales.</description>

      <title>Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET). Cloud-wide census of continuum sources showing low spectral indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is measured to form stars 10 times less efficiently than in the Galactic disk, based on emission from high-mass stars. However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which accounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate (SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and resolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm. The mosaicked observations achieve a comparable resolution of 0.2-0.3" (~1600-2500 au) and a sky coverage of 8.3-10.4 square arcmin, respectively. We report 563 continuum sources at 1.3 mm and 330 at 3 mm, respectively, and a dual-band catalog with 450 continuum sources. These sources are marginally resolved at the 2,000 au resolution. We find a cloud-wide deviation (&gt;70%) from commonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low spectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations for the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar objects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower brightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized) dust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore frequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free emission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low spectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of massive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal stellar initial mass function. A reliable measurement of the SFR at low protostellar masses will require future work to distinguish between these possible explanations.</description>

      <title>Sleeping Giants Arise: Monitoring the Return of Three Changing-Look Quasars to Their High States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-look quasars challenge many models of the quasar central engine. Their extreme variability in both the continuum and broad emission-line fluxes on timescales on the order of years is difficult to explain. To investigate the cause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to the high state. Two of these three faded changing-look quasars remained in a quiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state. We find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy distributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary outbursts, suggesting that the mechanism for the change is likely a changing accretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. We also find that, in two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and low state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly identical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition timescale is useful for testing theoretical models that attempt to explain the short time scale for the state transition.</description>

      <title>UNCOVER/MegaScience: No Evidence of Environmental Quenching in a z$\sim$2.6 Proto-cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental quenching -- where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies -- has long been proposed as the primary driver to establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift ($z&lt;1$). However, we still do not know whether these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James Webb Space Telescope has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$&lt;$9.5) galaxies at cosmic noon ($2 &lt; z &lt; 3$). Here, we use data from the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to directly probe the role of environmental quenching on low-mass galaxies in a newly-discovered $z\approx 2.6$ overdensity. Leveraging the deep imaging and R $\sim$ 15 spectrophotometry enabled by these JWST/NIRCam data, we analyze the stellar populations and inferred star formation histories (SFHs) of 20 low-mass (8.5$&lt;$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq$9.0) quiescent galaxies in the overdense environment and compare to a similar sample of 18 such galaxies in the field. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster and field across the entire probed stellar mass regime (8.5$&lt;$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq$11.0) are indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field. This is consistent with expectations that proto-clusters at $z&gt;2$ have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Stripped and Enriched: The Role of Ram-Pressure in Shaping Chemical Enrichment of Galaxies at Intermediate Redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of galaxies is shaped by their star formation histories and the exchange of gas with their environments. Metallicity provides key insights into these processes, reflecting the interplay between star formation and gas flows. A fundamental aspect of this evolution is the mass-metallicity relation, which captures the strong correlation between a galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) and its gas-phase oxygen abundance. In this study, we use MUSE observations to analyze star-forming disc galaxies in 12 clusters within the redshift range $0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.5$. Galaxies were classified into three groups: ram-pressure stripping (RPS), control cluster, and control field. For the first time, we investigate the impact of RPS on gas-phase metallicities across a wide mass range of galaxies at intermediate redshift, comparing RPS galaxies to counterparts in both cluster and field environments. By analyzing the integrated flux within galactic disks, our results reveal that, on average, RPS induces a metallicity enhancement of 0.2 dex over non-stripped galaxies. Contrary to the prevailing view that cluster membership alone drives metallicity enrichment, we find that control cluster galaxies exhibit metallicities comparable to field galaxies at a given $M_\star$, with only RPS galaxies displaying significantly higher metal content, highlighting the unique role of RPS in shaping the chemical properties of galaxies. These differences become more pronounced at lower $M_\star$, indicating that environmental influences play a more critical role in shaping the chemical evolution of lower-mass galaxies. Our findings suggest that both enhanced star formation rates and suppressed gas inflows -- consequences of ram pressure stripping -- drive the elevated metallicity observed in RPS galaxies.</description>

Abstract: To study how massive variable stars effect their environment, we search for variability among Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) sources located within the optical extent of a nearby starburst galaxy IC 10. We present the ZTF IC 10 catalog, which classifies 1516 $r$ band sources and 864 $g$ band sources within a $225''$ radius around IC 10 into three categories: 1388 (767) $r$ ($g$) band non-variables, 150 (85) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 37 (12) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables. Among them 101 (48) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 22 (4) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables are inside IC 10. We verify our classification by cross-matching with previous variability catalogs and machine learning powered classifications. Various analysis including population demographics, color-magnitude diagrams, and cross matching with a set of different surveys and database such as Gaia, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SIMBAD are also presented. Based on source density and parallax, we distinguish sources within IC 10 from non-IC 10 sources. For IC 10 sources, we highlight flaring super giants, a source with long secondary period, periodic super giants including possible S Doradus luminous blue variable and candidate Miras. For non-IC 10 sources, we present super red sources and compact objects such as a possible long period subdwarf and a periodic X-ray source. The catalog can serve as a useful database to study the connection between various type of massive stars and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively distinct turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second, the 'low-$\beta$ state,' which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim 1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress ($\alpha \sim 1$). The low-$\beta$ state emerges in simulations initialized with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this holds true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta \ll 1$, provided the thermal scale height of the disk is well resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we identify may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work, including the implications of our results for global accretion disk models and simulations.</description>

      <title>HOLESOM: Constraining the Properties of Slowly-Accreting Massive Black Holes with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\bullet &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) are known for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While MBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily detectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient modes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This challenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies and those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine learning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm, specifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse photometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\sim$ 20, 000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a source is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM through extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying slowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between radio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The primary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH candidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust framework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it a valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Weak CN Spectral Absorption Feature in Red Supergiant Stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Keck DEIMOS spectra of stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies, selected from the large multi-band (near ultraviolet, visible light, and near infrared) Hubble Space Telescope surveys PHAT and PHATTER, respectively, we have identified a subset of stars that contain a previously unnoticed weak spectral absorption feature around 8000 Angstrom (0.8 micron). This absorption feature appears to be associated with the cyanogen (CN) molecule. Strong CN spectral absorption is a standard feature of carbon stars, which are thought to be intermediate mass (2-3 ~ M_sun) stars with C/O &gt; 1 in the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. However, the stars that are the focus of this paper are characterized by a weak version of this CN spectral absorption feature in a spectrum that is otherwise dominated by normal O-rich spectral absorption lines such as TiO and/or the Ca near infrared triplet. We have dubbed these stars "weak CN" stars. We present an automated method for identifying weak CN stars in M31 and M33, and examine their photometric properties in relation to model isochrones and stellar tracks. We find that weak CN stars tend to be fairly localized in color-magnitude space, and appear to be red supergiant stars with masses ranging from 5-10 M_sun, overall lifetimes of about 40-50 Myr, and currently in the core He burning phase of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>
