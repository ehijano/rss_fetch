      <title>Nonunique Ergodicity on the Boundary of Outer space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To an $\mathbb{R}$-tree in the boundary of Outer space, we associate two simplices: the simplex of projective length measures, and the simplex of projective dual currents. For both kinds of simplices, we estimate the dimension of maximal simplices for arational $\mathbb{R}$-trees in the boundary of Outer space.</description>

      <title>On finite groups isospectral to groups with abelian Sylow $2$-subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of a finite group is the set of orders of its elements. We are concerned with finite groups having the same spectrum as a direct product of nonabelian simple groups with abelian Sylow $2$-subgroups. For every positive integer $k$, we find $k$ nonabelian simple groups with abelian Sylow 2-subgroups such that their direct product is uniquely determined by its spectrum in the class of all finite groups. On the other hand, we prove that there are infinitely many finite groups having the same spectrum as the direct cube of the small Ree group $^2G_2(q)$, $q&gt;3$, or the direct fourth power of the sporadic group $J_1$.</description>

      <title>On the Orbital Diameter of Primitive Affine Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital diameter of a primitive permutation group is the maximal diameter of its orbital graphs. There has been a lot of interest in bounds for the orbital diameter. In this paper we provide explicit bounds on the diameters of groups of primitive affine groups with almost quasisimple point stabilizer.
  As a consequence we obtain a partial classification of primitive affine groups with orbital diameter less than or equal to 2.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Orbit Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of orbit equivalence to the non-commutative setting by introducing a new equivalence relation on groups, which we call von Neumann orbit equivalence (vNOE). We prove the stability of this equivalence relation under taking free products and graph products of groups. To achieve this, we introduce von Neumann orbit equivalence of tracial von Neumann algebras, show that two countable discrete groups $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ are vNOE if and only if the corresponding group von Neumann algebras $L\Gamma$ and $L\Lambda$ are vNOE, and that vNOE of tracial von Neumann algebras is stable under taking free products and graph products of tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>On semigroups that are prime in the sense of Tarski, and groups prime in the senses of Tarski and of Rhodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of algebras closed under finite direct products, and $M_\mathcal{C}$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of members of $\mathcal{C},$ with operation induced by direct product, A.Tarski defines a nonidentity element $p$ of $M_\mathcal{C}$ to be prime if, whenever it divides a product of two elements in that monoid, it divides one of them, and calls an object of $\mathcal{C}$ prime if its isomorphism class has this property.
  McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor ask whether the category of nonempty semigroups has any prime objects. We show in section 2 that it does not. However, for the category of monoids, and some other subcategories of semigroups, we obtain examples of prime objects in sections 3-5 In section 6, two related questions open so far as I know, are recalled.
  In section 7, which can be read independently of the rest of this note, we recall two related conditions that are called primeness by semigroup theorists, and obtain results and examples on the relationships among those two conditions and Tarski's, in categories of groups. Section 8 notes an interesting characterization of one of those conditions when applied to finite algebras in an arbitrary variety.
  Various questions are raised.</description>

      <title>The stable module category and model structures for hierarchically defined groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we construct a compactly generated tensor-triangulated stable category for a large class of infinite groups, including those in Kropholler's hierarchy $\mathrm{LH}\mathfrak{F}$. This can be constructed as the homotopy category of a certain model category structure, which we show is Quillen equivalent to several other model categories, including those constructed by Bravo, Gillespie, and Hovey in their work on stable module categories for general rings. We also investigate the compact objects in this category. In particular, we give a characterisation of those groups of finite global Gorenstein AC-projective dimension such that the trivial representation $\mathbb{Z}$ is compact.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16233v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shnirel'man's inequality and Shnirel'man's basis theorem are fundamental results about sums of sets of positive integers in additive number theory. It is proved that these results are inherently order-theoretic and extend to partially ordered abelian and nonabelian groups. One abelian application is an addition theorem for sums of sets of $n$-dimensional lattice points.</description>

      <title>Simplicial pseudohyperplane arrangements give weak Garside groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we connect the language of Bessis's Garisde categories with Salvetti's metrical-hemisphere complexes in order to find new examples of weak Garside groups. As our main example, we show that the fundamental group of the (appropriately defined) complexified complement of a pseudohyperplane arrangement is a weak Garside group. As a consequence of the Folkman-Lawrence topological realization theorem, we also show that fundamental group of the Salvetti complex of a ("simplicial") oriented matroid is a weak Garside group. This provides novel examples of weak Garside groups.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Free and Free-Like Nilpotent Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a $\mathcal{T}$-group (finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent) with centralizers outside of the derived subgroup being abelian of rank equal to $\text{rank}(Z_1)+1$. This includes the class of free nilpotent groups $\mathcal{N}_{r,c}$ of a given rank $r$ and class $c$. It is shown that the upper and lower central series coincide in such groups and from this that they are metabelian. We then prove that all such groups arise as semidirect products of free abelian groups with respect to representation $[G,G]\to \text{UT}(n,\mathbb{Z})$ by automorphisms constructed from integer powers of elements in defining relations we call integral weights of $G$.</description>

      <title>On Heisenberg groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that an abelian group $A$ and a $2$-cocycle $c:A \times A \to C$ yield a group ${\mathscr{H}}(A,C,c)$ which we call a Heisenberg group. This group, a central extension of $A$, is the archetype of a class~$2$ nilpotent group. In this note, we prove that under mild conditions, any class~$2$ nilpotent group $G$ is equivalent as an extension of $G/[G,G]$ to a Heisenberg group ${\mathscr{H}}(G/[G,G], [G,G], c')$ whose $2$-cocycle $c'$ is bimultiplicative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.08085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the automorphism group of the cyclic orbifold of a vertex operator algebra associated with a rootless even lattice for a lift of a fixed-point free isometry of odd prime order $p$. We prove that such a cyclic orbifold contains extra automorphisms, not induced from automorphisms of the lattice vertex operator algebra, if and only if the rootless even lattice can be constructed by Construction B from a code over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ or is isometric to the coinvariant lattice of the Leech lattice associated with a certain isometry of order $p$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a central limit theorem in the framework of the group algebra of the Thompson group $F$. We consider the sequence of self-adjoint elements given by $a_n=\frac{g_n+g_n^{*}}{\sqrt{2}}$ in the noncommutative probability space $(\mathbb{C}(F),\varphi)$, where the expectation functional $\varphi$ is the trace associated to the left regular representation of $F$, and the $g_n$-s are the generators of $F$ in its standard infinite presentation. We show that the limit law of the sequence $s_n = \frac{a_0+\cdots+a_{n-1}}{\sqrt{n}}$ is the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Self-Avoiding Walks on Cayley Graphs Through the Lens of Symbolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dynamical and computational properties of the set of bi-infinite self-avoiding walks on Cayley graphs, as well as ways to compute, approximate and bound their connective constant. To do this, we introduce the skeleton $X_{G,S}$ of a finitely generated group $G$ relative to a generating set $S$, which is a one-dimensional subshift made of configurations on $S$ that avoid all words that reduce to the identity. We provide a characterization of groups which have SFT skeletons and sofic skeletons: first, there exists a finite generating set $S$ such that $X_{G,S}$ is a subshift of finite type if and only if $G$ is a plain group; second, there exists $S$ such that $X_{G,S}$ is sofic if and only if $G$ is a plain group, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathcal{D}_{\infty}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We also characterize finitely generated torsion groups as groups whose skeletons are aperiodic.
  For connective constants, using graph height functions and bridges, we show that Cayley graphs of finitely generated torsion groups do not admit graph height functions, and that for groups that admit transitive graph height functions, the connective constant is equal to the growth rate of periodic points of the skeleton. Finally, we take a brief look at the set of bi-infinite geodesics and introduce an analog of the connective constant for the geodesic growth.</description>

We show that the full automorphism group of the parafermion vertex operator algebra is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the associated root system for the remaining cases: (i) the level is at least $3$; (ii) the level is $2$ and the simple Lie algebra is non simply laced.</description>

      <title>Derandomized Non-Abelian Homomorphism Testing in Low Soundness Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a randomness-efficient homomorphism test in the low soundness regime for functions, $f: G\to \mathbb{U}_t$, from an arbitrary finite group $G$ to $t\times t$ unitary matrices. We show that if such a function passes a derandomized Blum--Luby--Rubinfeld (BLR) test (using small-bias sets), then (i) it correlates with a function arising from a genuine homomorphism, and (ii) it has a non-trivial Fourier mass on a low-dimensional irreducible representation.
  In the full randomness regime, such a test for matrix-valued functions on finite groups implicitly appears in the works of Gowers and Hatami [Sbornik: Mathematics '17], and Moore and Russell [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics '15]. Thus, our work can be seen as a near-optimal derandomization of their results. Our key technical contribution is a "degree-2 expander mixing lemma'' that shows that Gowers' $\mathrm{U}^2$ norm can be efficiently estimated by restricting it to a small-bias subset. Another corollary is a "derandomized'' version of a useful lemma due to Babai, Nikolov, and Pyber [SODA'08] and Gowers [Comb. Probab. Comput.'08].</description>
