      <title>Synchronization-induced violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations affect the functionality of nanodevices. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), derived within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, show that a minimal amount of dissipation is required to obtain a given relative energy current dispersion, that is, current precision has a thermodynamic cost. It is therefore of great interest to explore the possibility that TURs are violated, particularly for quantum systems, leading to accurate currents at lower cost. Here, we show that two quantum harmonic oscillators are synchronized by coupling to a common thermal environment, at strong dissipation and low temperature. In this regime, periodically modulated couplings to a second thermal reservoir, breaking time-reversal symmetry and taking advantage of non-Markovianity of this latter reservoir, lead to strong violation of TURs for local work currents, while maintaining finite output power. Our results pave the way for the use of synchronization in the thermodynamics of precision.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify (\emph{herald}) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <title>Efficient Variational Quantum Linear Solver for Structured Sparse Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for efficiently applying variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) in context of structured sparse matrices. Such matrices frequently arise during numerical solution of partial differential equations which are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Conventionally, Pauli basis is used for linear combination of unitary (LCU) decomposition of the underlying matrix to facilitate the evaluation the global/local VQLS cost functions. However, Pauli basis in worst case can result in number of LCU terms that scale quadratically with respect to the matrix size. We show that by using an alternate basis one can better exploit the sparsity and underlying structure of matrix leading to number of tensor product terms which scale only logarithmically with respect to the matrix size. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators, we employ the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum circuits for computing the global/local VQLS cost functions. We compare our approach with other related concepts in the literature including unitary dilation and measurement in Bell basis, and discuss its pros/cons while using VQLS applied to Heat equation as an example.</description>

      <title>Optimising the relative entropy under semi definite constraints -- A new tool for estimating key rates in QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the minimal relative entropy of two quantum states under semi definite constraints is a pivotal problem located at the mathematical core of various applications in quantum information theory. In this work, we provide a method that addresses this optimisation. Our primordial motivation stems form the essential task of estimating secret key rates for QKD from the measurement statistics of a real device. Further applications include the computation of channel capacities, the estimation of entanglement measures from experimental data and many more. For all those tasks it is highly relevant to provide both, provable upper and lower bounds. An efficient method for this is the central result of this work. We build on a recently introduced integral representation of quantum relative entropy by P.E. Frenkel and provide reliable bounds as a sequence of semi definite programs (SDPs). Our approach ensures provable quadratic order convergence, while also maintaining resource efficiency in terms of SDP matrix dimensions. Additionally, we can provide gap estimates to the optimum at each iteration stage.</description>

      <title>Quantum bit with telecom wave-length emission from a simple defect in Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-to-photon interfaces from defects in silicon hold great promise towards realizing quantum repeaters with the combination of advanced semiconductor and photonics technologies. Recently, controlled creation and erasure of simple carbon interstitial defects have been successfully realised in silicon. This defect has a stable structure near room temperature and emits in the wave-length where the signal loss is minimal in optical fibres used in communication technologies. Our in-depth theoretical characterization confirms the assignment of the observed emission to the neutral charge state of this defect. We find that the emission is due to the recombination of a bound exciton. We also discovered a metastable triplet state that could be applied as a quantum memory. Based on the analysis of the electronic structure of the defect and its similarities to a known optically detected magnetic resonance centre in silicon, we propose that a carbon interstitial can act as a quantum bit and may realize a spin-to-photon interface in CMOS-compatible platforms.</description>

      <title>Compiler for Distributed Quantum Computing: a Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical realization of quantum programs that require large-scale qubit systems is hindered by current technological limitations. Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) presents a viable path to scalability by interconnecting multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) through quantum links, facilitating the distributed execution of quantum circuits. In DQC, EPR pairs are generated and shared between distant QPUs, which enables quantum teleportation and facilitates the seamless execution of circuits. A primary obstacle in DQC is the efficient mapping and routing of logical qubits to physical qubits across different QPUs, necessitating sophisticated strategies to overcome hardware constraints and optimize communication. We introduce a novel compiler that, unlike existing approaches, prioritizes reducing the expected execution time by jointly managing the generation and routing of EPR pairs, scheduling remote operations, and injecting SWAP gates to facilitate the execution of local gates. We present a real-time, adaptive approach to compiler design, accounting for the stochastic nature of entanglement generation and the operational demands of quantum circuits. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we model the optimal compiler for DQC using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, establishing the existence of an optimal algorithm, and (ii) we introduce a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to approximate this optimal compiler, tailored to the complexities of DQC environments. Our simulations demonstrate that Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQNs) are effective in learning policies that minimize the depth of the compiled circuit, leading to a lower expected execution time and likelihood of successful operation before qubits decohere.</description>

      <title>Improving device-independent weak coin flipping protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak coin flipping is the cryptographic task where Alice and Bob remotely flip a coin but want opposite outcomes. This work studies this task in the device-independent regime where Alice and Bob neither trust each other, nor their quantum devices. The best protocol was devised over a decade ago by Silman, Chailloux, Aharon, Kerenidis, Pironio, and Massar with bias $\varepsilon \approx 0.33664$, where the bias is a commonly adopted security measure for coin flipping protocols. This work presents two techniques to lower the bias of such protocols, namely self-testing and abort-phobic compositions. We apply these techniques to the SCAKPM '11 protocol above and, assuming a continuity conjecture, lower the bias to $\varepsilon \approx 0.29104$. We believe that these techniques could be useful in the design of device-independent protocols for a variety of other tasks.
  Independently of weak coin flipping, en route to our results, we show how one can test $n-1$ out of $n$ devices, and estimate the performance of the remaining device, for later use in the protocol. The proof uses linear programming and, due to its generality, may find applications elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Finite-Depth Preparation of Tensor Network States from Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although tensor network states constitute a broad range of exotic quantum states, their realization is challenging and often requires resources whose depth scales with system size. In this work, we explore criteria on the local tensors for enabling deterministic state preparation via a single round of measurements and on-site unitary feedback. We use these criteria to construct families of measurement-preparable states in one and two dimensions, tuning between distinct symmetry-breaking, symmetry-protected, and intrinsic topological phases of matter. For instance, in one dimension we chart out a three-parameter family of preparable states which interpolate between the AKLT, cluster, GHZ and other states of interest. Our protocol even allows one to engineer preparable quantum states with a range of desired correlation lengths and entanglement properties. In addition to such constructive approaches, we present diagnostics for verifying whether a given tensor network state is preparable using measurements. We conclude by charting out generalizations, such as considering multiple rounds of measurements, implementing matrix product operators, and using incomplete basis measurements.</description>

      <title>Level attraction from interference in two-tone driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent and dissipative couplings, respectively characterised by energy level repulsion and attraction, each have different applications for quantum information processing. Thus, a system in which both coherent and dissipative couplings are tunable on-demand and in-situ is tantalising. A first step towards this goal is the two-tone driving of two bosonic modes, whose experimental signature was shown to exhibit controllable level repulsion and attraction by changing the phase and amplitude of one drive. However, whether the underlying physics is that of coherent and dissipative couplings has not been clarified, and cannot be concluded solely from the measured resonances (or anti-resonances) of the system. Here, we show how the physics at play can be analysed theoretically. Combining this theory with realistic finite-element simulations, we deduce that the observation of level attraction originates from interferences due to the measurement setup, and not dissipative coupling. Beyond the clarification of a novel origin for level attraction attributed to interference, our work demonstrate how effective Hamiltonians can be derived to appropriately describe the physics.</description>

      <title>Automated Quantum Circuit Generation for Computing Inverse Hash Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several cryptographic systems depend upon the computational difficulty of reversing cryptographic hash functions. Robust hash functions transform inputs to outputs in such a way that the inputs cannot be later retrieved in a reasonable amount of time even if the outputs and the function that created them are known. Consequently, hash functions can be cryptographically secure, and they are employed in encryption, authentication, and other security methods. It has been suggested that such cryptographically-secure hash functions will play a critical role in the era of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), as they do in conventional systems. In this work, we introduce a procedure that leverages the principle of reversibility to generate circuits that invert hash functions. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and describe methods that allow for scaling the hash function inversion approach. Specifically, we implement one manifestation of the algorithm as part of a more general automated quantum circuit synthesis, compilation, and optimization toolkit. We illustrate production of reversible circuits for crypto-hash functions that inherently provide the inverse of the function, and we describe data structures that increase the scalability of the hash function inversion approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cavity field state, which is created by the atom-cavity field's interaction in the presence of a driven field. The two-level atom passes through the cavity and is driven by a weak classical field. A photon number dependent Stark shift is induced by the atom's dispersive interaction with the cavity field. When the atom is in excited state $|a\rangle$, the output cavity field thus obtained is taken into consideration. With the help of the state evaluated, we investigate different statistical properties such as photon number distribution, Wigner function, Mandel's $Q$ parameter and squeezing.</description>

      <title>The role of quantum and classical correlations in shrinking algorithms for optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The benefit of quantum computing for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) constitutes an open research question. In this work, we study the performance of a shrinking algorithm for COPs. The algorithm leverages correlations extracted from quantum or classical subroutines to recursively simplify the problem. We compare the performance of the algorithm equipped with correlations from the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) as well as the classical linear programming (LP) and semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations. This allows us to benchmark the utility of QAOA correlations against established classical relaxation algorithms. We apply the recursive algorithm to MaxCut problem instances with up to a hundred vertices at different graph densities. Our results indicate that LP outperforms all other approaches for low-density instances, while SDP excels for high-density problems. Moreover, the shrinking algorithm proves to be a viable alternative to established methods of rounding LP and SDP relaxations. In addition, the recursive shrinking algorithm outperforms its bare counterparts for all three types of correlations, i.e., LP with spanning tree rounding, the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, and conventional QAOA. While the lowest depth QAOA consistently yields worse results than the SDP, our tensor network experiments show that the performance increases significantly for deeper QAOA circuits.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and expansion of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by noise, leading to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this model to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and derive an analytical approximation for the defect density. Our analysis reveals that under small noise conditions, the model follows an anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. As the noise increases, a new scaling behavior emerges, showing higher accuracy than previously reported. Furthermore, we identify the parameters that optimize the defect density based on the new scaling. This allows for the refinement of optimized parameters with greater precision and provides further validations of previously established scaling.</description>

      <title>Typical behaviour of genuine multimode entanglement of pure Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trends of genuine entanglement in Haar uniformly generated multimode pure Gaussian states with fixed average energy per mode are explored. A distance-based metric known as the generalized geometric measure (GGM) is used to quantify genuine entanglement. The GGM of a state is defined as its minimum distance from the set of all non-genuinely entangled states. To begin with, we derive an expression for the Haar averaged value of any function defined on the set of energy-constrained states. Subsequently, we investigate states with a large number of modes and provide a closed-form expression for the Haar averaged GGM in terms of the average energy per mode. Furthermore, we demonstrate that typical states closely approximate their Haar averaged GGM value, with deviation probabilities bounded by an exponentially suppressed limit. We then analyze the GGM content of typical states with a finite number of modes and present the distribution of GGM. Our findings indicate that as the number of modes increases, the distribution shifts towards higher entanglement values and becomes more concentrated. We quantify these features by computing the Haar averaged GGM and the standard deviation of the GGM distribution, revealing that the former increases while the latter decreases with the number of modes.</description>

      <title>Identical particles as a genuine non-local resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All particles of the same type are indistinguishable, according to a fundamental quantum principle. This entails a description of many-particle states using symmetrised or anti-symmetrised wave functions, which turn out to be formally entangled. However, the measurement of individual particles is hampered by a mode description in the second-quantised theory that masks this entanglement. Is it nonetheless possible to use such states as a resource in Bell-type experiments? More specifically, which states of identical particles can demonstrate non-local correlations in passive linear optical setups that are considered purely classical component of the experiment? Here, the problem is fully solved for multi-particle states with a definite number of identical particles. We show that all fermion states and most boson states provide a sufficient quantum resource to exhibit non-locality in classical optical setups. The only exception is a special class of boson states that are reducible to a single mode, which turns out to be locally simulable for any passive linear optical experiment. This finding highlights the connection between the basic concept of particle indistinguishability and Bell non-locality, which can be observed by classical means for almost every state of identical particles.</description>

      <title>Walking behavior induced by $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking in a non-Hermitian $\rm XY$ model with clock anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian may exhibit zero temperature phase transitions that are driven by interactions, just as its Hermitian counterpart, raising the fundamental question how non-Hermiticity affects quantum criticality. In this context we consider a non-Hermitian system consisting of an $\rm XY$ model with a complex-valued four-state clock interaction that may or may not have parity-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. When the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken, and time-evolution becomes non-unitary, a scaling behavior similar to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition ensues, but in a highly unconventional way, as the line of fixed points is absent. From the analysis of the $d$-dimensional RG equations, we obtain that the unconventional behavior in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken regime follows from the collision of two fixed points in the $d\to 2$ limit, leading to walking behavior or pseudocriticality. For $d=2+1$ the near critical behavior is characterized by a correlation length exponent $\nu=3/8$, a value smaller than the mean-field one. These results are in sharp contrast with the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case where only one fixed point arises for $2&lt;d&lt;4$ and in $d=1+1$ three lines of fixed points occur with a continuously varying critical exponent $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Observation of Ultra-low AC Susceptibility in Micro-magnets Using Quantum Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AC susceptometry, unlike static susceptometry, offers a deeper insight into magnetic materials. By employing AC susceptibility measurements, one can glean into crucial details regarding magnetic dynamics. Nevertheless, traditional AC susceptometers are constrained to measuring changes in magnetic moments within the range of a few nano-joules per tesla. Additionally, their spatial resolution is severely limited, confining their application to bulk samples only. In this study, we introduce the utilization of a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) center-based quantum diamond microscope for mapping the AC susceptibility of micron-scale ferromagnetic specimens. By employing coherent pulse sequences, we extract both magnitude and the phase of the field from samples within a field of view spanning 70 micro-meters while achieving a resolution of 1 micro-meter. Furthermore, we quantify changes in dipole moment on the order of a femto-joules per tesla induced by excitations at frequencies reaching several hundred kilohertz.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adjoint Convolutional Layers for Effective Data Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Convolutional Layer (QCL) is considered as one of the core of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) due to its efficient data feature extraction capability. However, the current principle of QCL is not as mathematically understandable as Classical Convolutional Layer (CCL) due to its black-box structure. Moreover, classical data mapping in many QCLs is inefficient. To this end, firstly, the Quantum Adjoint Convolution Operation (QACO) consisting of a quantum amplitude encoding and its inverse is theoretically shown to be equivalent to the quantum normalization of the convolution operation based on the Frobenius inner product while achieving an efficient characterization of the data. Subsequently, QACO is extended into a Quantum Adjoint Convolutional Layer (QACL) by Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to compute all Frobenius inner products in parallel. At last, comparative simulation experiments are carried out on PennyLane and TensorFlow platforms, mainly for the two cases of kernel fixed and unfixed in QACL. The results demonstrate that QACL with the insight of special quantum properties for the same images, provides higher training accuracy in MNIST and Fashion MNIST classification experiments, but sacrifices the learning performance to some extent. Predictably, our research lays the foundation for the development of efficient and interpretable quantum convolutional networks and also advances the field of quantum machine vision.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Whispering Gallery Mode Phase Shift using Indistinguishable Photon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator coupled to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and show a bimodal coincidence transmission spectrum when the input state is an indistinguishable photon pair. This is due to the doubled WGM phase shift experienced by the path-entangled state in the interferometer. Further, we model the noise in a WGM resonance shift measurement comparing photon pairs with a coherent state. At least a four-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is possible, with clear implications for quantum-enhanced WGM sensing.</description>

      <title>Finite Key Security of Simplified Trusted Node Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplified trusted nodes (STNs) are a form of trusted node for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks which do not require running a full QKD stack every instance (i.e., they do not need to run error correction and privacy amplification each session). Such systems hold the advantage that they may be implemented with weaker computational abilities, than regular TNs, while still keeping up with key generation rate demands. The downside is that noise tolerance is lower. However, to get a better understanding of their suitability in various scenarios, one requires practical, finite-key security bounds for STN networks. So far, only theoretical asymptotic bounds are known. In this work we derive a new proof of security for STN chains in the finite key setting. We also derive a novel cost function allowing us to evaluate when STNs would be beneficial from a computational cost perspective, compared with regular TN networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-relativistic particle in a one-dimensional box with all possible quantum boundary conditions that make the kinetic-energy operator selfadjoint. We determine the Wigner functions of the corresponding eigenfunctions and analyze in detail their classical limit in the high-energy regime. We show that the quantum boundary conditions split into two classes: all local and regular boundary conditions collapse to the same classical boundary condition, while singular non-local boundary conditions slightly persist in the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Engines: Assessing Time, Cost and Performance Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the crucial role of measurement time ($t_m$), information gain and energy consumption in information engines (IEs) utilizing a von-Neumann measurement model. These important measurement parameters allow us to analyze the efficiency and power output of these devices. As the measurement time increases, the information gain and subsequently the extracted work also increase. However, there is a corresponding increase in the energetic cost. The efficiency of converting information into free energy diminishes as $t_m$ approaches both 0 and infinity, peaking at intermediate values of $t_m$. The power output (work extracted per times) also reaches a maximum at specific operational time regimes. By considering the product of efficiency and power as a performance metric, we can identify the optimal operating conditions for the IE.</description>

      <title>Spiral flow of quantum quartic oscillator with energy cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory of the quantum quartic oscillator is developed with close attention to the energy cutoff one needs to impose on the system in order to approximate the smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates of its Hamiltonian by diagonalizing matrices of limited size. The matrices are obtained by evaluating matrix elements of the Hamiltonian between the associated harmonic-oscillator eigenstates and by correcting the computed matrices to compensate for their limited dimension, using the Wilsonian renormalization-group procedure. The cutoff dependence of the corrected matrices is found to be described by a spiral motion of a three-dimensional vector. This behavior is shown to result from a combination of a limit-cycle and a floating fixed-point behaviors, a distinct feature of the foundational quantum system that warrants further study. A brief discussion of the research directions concerning renormalization of polynomial interactions of degree higher than four, spontaneous symmetry breaking and coupling of more than one oscillator through the near neighbor couplings known in condensed matter and quantum field theory, is included.</description>

      <title>Superresolution imaging of two incoherent optical sources with unequal brightnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving the separation between two incoherent optical sources with high precision is of great significance for fluorescence imaging and astronomical observations. In this paper, we focus on a more general scenario where two sources have unequal brightnesses. We give the ultimate precision limit with respect to separation by using the quantum Fisher information. Through the calculation of the classical Fisher information, we analyze and compare several specific measurement schemes including direct measurement, Gaussian mode measurement and zero-photon measurement. The results indicate that Gaussian mode measurement is the nearly optimal for a small separation. Our work provides a positive complement to the aspect of superresolution imaging of incoherent sources.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate is a widely used entangling gate for ion platforms with inherent robustness to trap heating. The gate performance is limited by coherent errors, arising from the Lamb-Dicke (LD) approximation and sideband errors. Here, we provide explicit analytical formulas for errors up to fourth order in the LD parameter, by using the Magnus expansion to match numerical precision. We show that fourth order Magnus expansion terms are unavoidable, being in fact leading order in LD, and are therefore critical to include for typical target gate fidelities. We show how these errors can be partially compensated using analytical renormalization of the drive strength, by calibration of the Lamb-Dicke parameter, and by the use of smooth pulse shaping.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Aerial Ad-hoc Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) as combination of quantum computing with machine learning (ML) is a promising direction to explore, in particular due to the advances in realizing quantum computers and the hoped-for quantum advantage. A field within QML that is only little approached is quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning (QMARL), despite having shown to be potentially attractive for addressing industrial applications such as factory management, cellular access and mobility cooperation. This paper presents an aerial communication use case and introduces a hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) ML algorithm to solve it. This use case intends to increase the connectivity of flying ad-hoc networks and is solved by an HQC multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm in which the core of the centralized critic is replaced with a data reuploading variational quantum circuit. Results show a slight increase in performance for the quantum-enhanced solution with respect to a comparable classical algorithm, earlier reaching convergence, as well as the scalability of such a solution: an increase in the size of the ansatz, and thus also in the number of trainable parameters, leading to better outcomes. These promising results show the potential of QMARL to industrially-relevant complex use cases.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum utility for NMR quantum simulation on a NISQ computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the recent demonstration of accurate computations of classically intractable simulations on noisy quantum processors brings quantum advantage closer, there is still the challenge of demonstrating it for practical problems. Here we investigate the application of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments in the high-field regime. In this work, the NMR interactions are mapped to a quantum device via a product formula with minimal resource overhead, an approach that we discuss in detail. Using this approach, we show the results of simulations of liquid-state proton NMR spectra on relevant molecules with up to 11 spins, and up to a total of 47 atoms, and compare them with real NMR experiments. Despite current limitations, we show that a similar approach will eventually lead to a case of quantum utility, a scenario where a practically relevant computational problem can be solved by a quantum computer but not by conventional means. We provide an experimental estimation of the amount of quantum resources needed for solving larger instances of the problem with the presented approach. The polynomial scaling we demonstrate on real processors is a foundational step in bringing practical quantum computation closer to reality.</description>

      <title>Exploiting many-body localization for scalable variational quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a promising approach to achieving practical quantum advantages using near-term quantum devices. Despite their potential, the scalability of these algorithms poses a significant challenge. This is largely attributed to the "barren plateau" phenomenon, which persists even in the absence of noise. In this work, we explore the many-body localization (MBL)-thermalization phase transitions within a framework of Floquet-initialized variational quantum circuits and investigate how MBL could be used to avoid barren plateaus. The phase transitions are observed through calculations of the inverse participation ratio, the entanglement entropy, and a metric termed \text{low-weight stabilizer R\'enyi entropy}. A critical element of our study involves the experimental validation of the phase transitions using the 127-qubit IBMQ Brisbane quantum processor. By initializing the circuit in the MBL phase and employing an easily preparable initial state, we find it is possible to prevent the formation of a unitary 2-design, resulting in an output state with entanglement that follows an area- rather than a volume-law, and which circumvents barren plateaus throughout the optimization. Utilizing this methodology, we successfully determine the ground states of various model Hamiltonians across different phases and show that the resources required for the optimization are significantly reduced. These results provide new insights into the interplay between MBL and quantum computing and suggest that the role of MBL states should be considered in the design of quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Whilst holding great promise for low noise, ease of operation and networking, useful photonic quantum computing has been precluded by the need for beyond-state-of-the-art components, manufactured by the millions. Here we introduce a manufacturable platform for quantum computing with photons. We benchmark a set of monolithically-integrated silicon photonics-based modules to generate, manipulate, network, and detect photonic qubits, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with $99.98\% \pm 0.01\%$ state preparation and measurement fidelity, Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference between independent photon sources with $99.50\%\pm0.25\%$ visibility, two-qubit fusion with $99.22\%\pm0.12\%$ fidelity, and a chip-to-chip qubit interconnect with $99.72\%\pm0.04\%$ fidelity, not accounting for loss. In addition, we preview a selection of next generation technologies, demonstrating low-loss silicon nitride waveguides and components, fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors, low-loss chip-to-fiber coupling, and barium titanate electro-optic phase shifters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-quality solutions faster than classical solvers on computationally hard problems is a challenge for quantum optimization to deliver utility. Using a superconducting quantum computer, we experimentally investigate the performance of a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm inspired by semidefinite programming approaches for solving the maximum cut problem on 3-regular graphs up to several thousand variables. We leverage the structure of the input problems to address sizes beyond what current quantum machines can naively handle. We attain an average performance of 99% over a random ensemble of thousands of problem instances. We benchmark the quantum solver against similarly high-performing classical heuristics, including the Gurobi optimizer, simulated annealing, and the Burer-Monteiro algorithm. A runtime analysis shows that the quantum solver on large-scale problems is competitive against Gurobi but short of others. We explore multiple leads to close the gap and discuss prospects for a practical quantum speedup.</description>

      <title>Photon correlation time-asymmetry and dynamical coherence in multichromophoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate polarization-filtered two-photon correlations for the light emitted by a multichromophoric system undergoing excitation transport under realistic exciton-phonon interactions, and subject to continuous incoherent illumination. We show that for a biomolecular aggregate, such as the Fenna-Matthews Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex, time-asymmetries in the cross-correlations of photons corresponding to different polarizations can be exploited to probe both quantum coherent transport mechanisms and steady-state coherence properties, which are not witnessed by zero-delay correlations. A classical bound on correlation asymmetry is obtained, which FMO is shown to violate using exact numerical calculations. Our analysis indicates that the dominant contributions to time-asymmetry in such photon cross-correlations are population to coherence transfer for Frenkel-Exciton models. Our results therefore put forward photon correlation asymmetry as a promising approach to investigate coherent contributions to excited-stated dynamics in molecular aggregates and other many-site quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that 1D lattice models exhibit superdiffusive transport in the presence of random "nodal impurities" in the absence of interaction. Here a nodal impurity is defined as a localized state, the wave function of which has zeros (nodes) in momentum space. The dynamics exponent $z$, a defining quantity for transport behaviors, is computed to establish this result. To be specific, in a disordered system having only nodal impurities, the dynamical exponent $z=4n/(4n-1)$ where $n$ is the order of the node. If the system has time reversal, the nodes appear in pairs and the dynamical exponent can be enhanced to $z=8n/(8n-1)$. As $1&lt;z&lt;2$, both cases indicate superdiffusive transport.</description>

      <title>Metrology of microwave fields based on trap-loss spectroscopy with cold Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new approach for the metrology of microwave fields based on the trap-loss-spectroscopy of cold Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. Compared to state-of-the-art sensors using room-temperature vapors, cold atoms allow longer interaction times, better isolation from the environment and a reduced Doppler effect. Our approach is particularly simple as the detection relies on fluorescence measurements only. Moreover, our signal is well described by a two-level model across a broad measurement range, allowing in principle to reconstruct the amplitude and the frequency of the microwave field simultaneously without the need for an external reference field. We report on a scale factor linearity at the percent level and no noticeable drifts over two hours, paving the way for new applications of cold Rydberg atoms in metrology such as calibrating blackbody shifts in state-of-the-art optical clocks, monitoring the Earth cryosphere from space, measuring the cosmic microwave background or searching for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Towards determining the (2+1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics running coupling with Monte Carlo and quantum computing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions and present a strategy for studying the running coupling and extracting the non-perturbative $\Lambda$-parameter. To this end, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and quantum computing, where the former can be used to determine the numerical value of the lattice spacing $a$, and the latter allows for reaching the perturbative regime at very small values of the bare coupling and, correspondingly, small values of $a$. The methodology involves a series of sequential steps (i.e., the step scaling function) to bridge results from small lattice spacings to non-perturbative large-scale lattice calculations. To address the model on current and near-future quantum devices, we propose variational Ansatz circuits adapted to gauge degrees of freedom. Focusing on the pure gauge case, we demonstrate that these quantum circuits are able to capture the relevant physics by studying the expectation value of the plaquette operator, for matching with corresponding Monte Carlo simulations. We also present results for the static potential and static force, which can be related to the renormalized coupling. The procedure outlined in this work can be extended to Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter fields and might provide a way towards studying lattice quantum chromodynamics utilizing both quantum and classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate its robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study its emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework for quantum Hamiltonian simulation and duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogue Hamiltonian simulation is a promising near-term application of quantum computing and has recently been put on a theoretical footing. In Hamiltonian simulation, a physical Hamiltonian is engineered to have identical physics to another - often very different - Hamiltonian. This is qualitatively similar to the notion of duality in physics, whereby two superficially different theories are mathematically equivalent in some precise sense. However, existing characterisations of Hamiltonian simulations are not sufficiently general to extend to all dualities in physics. In particular, they cannot encompass the important cases of strong/weak and high-temperature/low-temperature dualities. In this work, we give three physically motivated axiomatisations of duality, formulated respectively in terms of observables, partition functions and entropies. We prove that these axiomatisations are equivalent, and characterise the mathematical form that any duality satisfying these axioms must take. A building block in one of our results is a strengthening of earlier results on entropy-preserving maps to maps that are entropy-preserving up to an additive constant, which we prove decompose as a direct sum of unitary and anti-unitary components, which may be of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum Federated Learning for Distributed Quantum Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated learning is a framework that can learn from distributed networks. It attempts to build a global model based on virtual fusion data without sharing the actual data. Nevertheless, the traditional federated learning process encounters two main challenges: high computational cost and message transmission security. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum federated learning for distributed quantum networks by utilizing interesting characteristics of quantum mechanics. First, we give two methods to extract the data information to the quantum state. It can cope with different acquisition frequencies of data information. Next, a quantum gradient descent algorithm is provided to help clients in the distributed quantum networks to train local models. In other words, the algorithm gives the clients a mechanism to estimate the gradient of the local model in parallel. Compared with the classical counterpart, the proposed algorithm achieves exponential acceleration in dataset scale and quadratic speedup in data dimensionality. And, a quantum secure multi-party computation protocol is designed, which utilizes the Chinese residual theorem. It could avoid errors and overflow problems that may occur in the process of large number operation. Security analysis shows that this quantum protocol can resist common external and internal attacks. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we use it to the train federated linear regression model and execute essential computation steps on the Qiskit quantum computing framework.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Algorithms for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization via Integer Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, research in quantum computation promises potential for outperforming classical heuristics in combinatorial optimization. However, when aiming at provable optimality, one has to rely on classical exact methods like integer programming. State-of-the-art integer programming algorithms can compute strong relaxation bounds even for hard instances, but may have to enumerate a large number of subproblems for determining an optimum solution. If the potential of quantum computing realizes, it can be expected that in particular finding high-quality solutions for hard problems can be done fast. Still, near-future quantum hardware considerably limits the size of treatable problems. In this work, we go one step into integrating the potentials of quantum and classical techniques for combinatorial optimization. We propose a hybrid heuristic for the weighted maximum-cut problem or, equivalently, for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. The heuristic employs a linear programming relaxation, rendering it well-suited for integration into exact branch-and-cut algorithms. For large instances, we reduce the problem size according to a linear relaxation such that the reduced problem can be handled by quantum machines of limited size. Moreover, we improve the applicability of QAOA, a parameterized quantum algorithm, by deriving optimal parameters for special instances which motivates a parameter estimate for arbitrary instances. We present numerous computational results from real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Virtual quantum resource distillation</title>

Abstract: Distillation, or purification, is central to the practical use of quantum resources in noisy settings often encountered in quantum communication and computation. Conventionally, distillation requires using some restricted 'free' operations to convert a noisy state into one that approximates a desired pure state. Here, we propose to relax this setting by only requiring the approximation of the measurement statistics of a target pure state, which allows for additional classical postprocessing of the measurement outcomes. We show that this extended scenario, which we call virtual resource distillation, provides considerable advantages over standard notions of distillation, allowing for the purification of noisy states from which no resources can be distilled conventionally. We show that general states can be virtually distilled with a cost (measurement overhead) that is inversely proportional to the amount of existing resource, and we develop methods to efficiently estimate such cost via convex and semidefinite programming, giving several computable bounds. We consider applications to coherence, entanglement, and magic distillation, and an explicit example in quantum teleportation (distributed quantum computing). This work opens a new avenue for investigating generalized ways to manipulate quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Good Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes from the NTRU cryptosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of random Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes derived from the cryptanalysis of the so-called NTRU cryptosystem. The derived codes are good in that they exhibit constant rate and average distance scaling $\Delta \propto \sqrt{n}$ with high probability, where $n$ is the number of bosonic modes, which is a distance scaling equivalent to that of a GKP code obtained by concatenating single mode GKP codes into a qubit-quantum error correcting code with linear distance. The derived class of NTRU-GKP codes has the additional property that decoding for a stochastic displacement noise model is equivalent to decrypting the NTRU cryptosystem, such that every random instance of the code naturally comes with an efficient decoder. This construction highlights how the GKP code bridges aspects of classical error correction, quantum error correction as well as post-quantum cryptography. We underscore this connection by discussing the computational hardness of decoding GKP codes and propose, as a new application, a simple public key quantum communication protocol with security inherited from the NTRU cryptosystem.</description>

Abstract: We propose a qubit basis composed of transverse spin helices with kinks. Unlike the usual computational basis, this chiral basis is well suited for describing quantum states with nontrivial topology. Choosing appropriate parameters the operators of the transverse spin components, $\sigma_n^x$ and $\sigma_n^y$, become diagonal in the chiral basis, which facilitates the study of problems focused on transverse spin components. As an application, we study the temporal decay of the transverse polarization of a spin helix in the XX model that has been measured in recent cold atom experiments. We obtain an explicit universal function describing the relaxation of helices of arbitrary wavelength.</description>

Abstract: Classical polarimetry is a well-established discipline with diverse applications across different branches of science. The burgeoning interest in leveraging quantum resources to achieve highly sensitive measurements has spurred researchers to elucidate the behavior of polarized light within a quantum mechanical framework, thereby fostering the development of a quantum theory of polarimetry. In this work, drawing inspiration from polarimetric investigations in biological tissues, we investigate the precision limits of polarization rotation angle estimation about a known rotation axis, in a quantum polarimetric process, comprising three distinct quantum channels. The rotation angle to be estimated is induced by the retarder channel on the Stokes vector of the probe state. The diattenuator and depolarizer channels, acting on the probe state, can be thought of as effective noise processes. We explore the precision constraints inherent in quantum polarimetry by evaluating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for probe states of significance in quantum metrology, namely NOON, Kings of Quantumness, and Coherent states. The effects of the noise channels as well as their ordering is analyzed on the estimation error of the rotation angle to characterize practical and optimal quantum probe states for quantum polarimetry. Furthermore, we propose an experimental framework tailored for NOON state quantum polarimetry, aiming to bridge theoretical insights with empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Quantum soft-covering lemma with applications to rate-distortion coding, resolvability and identification via quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum soft-covering problem for a given general quantum channel and one of its output states, which consists in finding the minimum rank of an input state needed to approximate the given channel output. We then prove a one-shot quantum covering lemma in terms of smooth min-entropies by leveraging decoupling techniques from quantum Shannon theory. This covering result is shown to be equivalent to a coding theorem for rate distortion under a posterior (reverse) channel distortion criterion by two of the present authors. Both one-shot results directly yield corollaries about the i.i.d. asymptotics, in terms of the coherent information of the channel.
  The power of our quantum covering lemma is demonstrated by two additional applications: first, we formulate a quantum channel resolvability problem, and provide one-shot as well as asymptotic upper and lower bounds. Secondly, we provide new upper bounds on the unrestricted and simultaneous identification capacities of quantum channels, in particular separating for the first time the simultaneous identification capacity from the unrestricted one, proving a long-standing conjecture of the last author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical aspects of the quantum switch and find a particular form of quantum memory emerging out of the switch action. We first analyse the loss of information in a general quantum evolution subjected to a quantum switch and propose a measure to quantify the switch-induced memory. We then derive an uncertainty relation between information loss and switch-induced memory. We explicitly consider the example of depolarizing dynamics and show how it is affected by the action of a quantum switch. For a more detailed analysis, we consider both the control qubit and the final measurement on the control qubit as noisy and investigate the said uncertainty relation. Further, while deriving the Lindblad-type dynamics for the reduced operation of the switch action, we identify that the switch-induced memory actually leads to the emergence of non-Markovianity. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the emergent non-Markovianity can be explicitly attributed to the switch operation by comparing it with other standard measures of non-Markovianity. Our investigation thus paves the way forward to understanding the quantum switch as an emerging non-Markovian quantum memory.</description>

Abstract: This experimental study aims to investigate the convex combinations of Pauli semigroups with arbitrary mixing parameters to determine whether the resulting dynamical map exhibits Markovian or non-Markovian behavior. Specifically, we consider the cases of equal as well as unequal mixing of two Pauli semigroups, and demonstrate that the resulting map is always non-Markovian. Additionally, we study three cases of three-way mixing of the three Pauli semigroups and determine the Markovianity or non-Markovianity of the resulting maps by experimentally determining the decay rates. To simulate the non-unitary dynamics of a single qubit system with different mixing combinations of Pauli semigroups on an NMR quantum processor, we use an algorithm involving two ancillary qubits. The experimental results align with the theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Bell inequalities play a key role in certifying quantum properties for device-independent quantum information protocols. It is still a major challenge, however, to devise Bell inequalities tailored for an arbitrary given quantum state. Existing approaches based on sums of squares provide results in this direction, but they are restricted by the necessity of first choosing measurement settings suited to the state. Here, we show how the sum of square property can be enforced for an arbitrary target state by making an appropriate choice of nullifiers, which is made possible by leaving freedom in the choice of measurement. Using our method, we construct simple Bell inequalities for several families of quantum states, including partially entangled multipartite GHZ states and qutrit states. In most cases we are able to prove that the constructed Bell inequalities achieve self-testing of the target state. We also use the freedom in the choice of measurement to self-test partially entangled two-qubit states with a family of settings with two parameters. Finally, we show that some statistics can be self-tested with distinct Bell inequalities, hence obtaining new insight on the shape of the set of quantum correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do quantum correlations lead to better performance with respect to several different systems working independently? For quantum thermal machines, the question is whether a working medium (WM) made of $N$ constituents exhibits better performance than $N$ independent engines working in parallel. Here, by inspecting a microscopic model with the WM composed by two non-interacting quantum harmonic oscillators, we show that the presence of a common environment can mediate non-trivial correlations in the WM leading to better quantum heat engine performance -- maximum power and efficiency -- with respect to an independent configuration. Furthermore, this advantage is striking for strong dissipation, a regime in which two independent engines cannot deliver any useful power. Our results show that dissipation can be exploited as a useful resource for quantum thermal engines, and are corroborated by optimization techniques here extended to non-Markovian quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement detection with imperfect measurements: concept and experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard procedures for entanglement detection assume that experimenters can exactly implement specific quantum measurements. Here, we depart from such idealizations and investigate, in both theory and experiment, the detection of genuine multipartite entanglement when measurements are subject to small imperfections. For arbitrary qubits number $n$, we construct multipartite entanglement witnesses where the detrimental influence of the imperfection is independent of $n$. In a tabletop four-partite photonic experiment we demonstrate first how a small amount of alignment error can undermine the conclusions drawn from standard entanglement witnesses, and then perform the correction analysis. Furthermore, since we consider quantum devices that are trusted but not perfectly controlled, we showcase advantages in terms of noise resilience as compared to device-independent models.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel general-purpose algorithm for Pauli decomposition that employs matrix slicing and addition rather than expensive matrix multiplication, significantly accelerating the decomposition of multi-qubit matrices. In a detailed complexity analysis, we show that the algorithm admits the best known worst-case scaling and more favorable runtimes for many practical examples. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the asymptotic speed-up already for small instance sizes, underscoring the algorithm's potential significance in the realm of quantum computing and quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Rotational magic conditions for ultracold molecules in the presence of Raman and Rayleigh scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules have vibrational, rotational, spin-orbit and hyperfine degrees of freedom or quantum states, each of which responds in a unique fashion to external electromagnetic radiation. The control over superpositions of these quantum states is key to coherent manipulation of molecules. For example, the better the coherence time the longer quantum simulations can last. The important quantity for controlling an ultracold molecule with laser light is its complex-valued molecular dynamic polarizability. Its real part determines the tweezer or trapping potential as felt by the molecule, while its imaginary part limits the coherence time. Here, our study shows that efficient trapping of a molecule in its vibrational ground state can be achieved by selecting a laser frequency with a detuning on the order of tens of GHz relative to an electric-dipole-forbidden molecular transition. Close proximity to this nearly forbidden transition allows to create a sufficiently deep trapping potential for multiple rotational states without sacrificing coherence times among these states from Raman and Rayleigh scattering. In fact, we demonstrate that magic trapping conditions for multiple rotational states of the ultracold $^{23}$Na$^{87}$Rb polar molecule can be created.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of steady-state superradiance in extended driven atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generating well controlled dense arrangements of individual atoms in free space have generated interest in understanding how the extended nature of these systems influences superradiance phenomena. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis on how space-dependent light-shifts and decay rates induced by dipole-dipole interactions modify the steady-state properties of coherently driven arrays of quantum emitters. We characterize the steady-state phase diagram, with particular focus on the radiative properties in the steady-state. Interestingly, we find that diverging from the well-established Dicke paradigm of equal all-to-all interactions significantly modifies the emission properties. In particular, the prominent quadratic scaling of the radiated light intensity with particle number in the steady-state -- a hallmark of steady-state Dicke superradiance -- is entirely suppressed, resulting in only linear scaling with particle number. We show that this breakdown of steady-state superradiance occurs due to the emergence of additional dissipation channels that populate not only superradiant states but also subradiant ones. The additional contribution of subradiant dark states in the dynamics leads to a divergence in the time scales needed to achieve steady-states. Building on this, we further show that measurements taken at finite times for extended atom ensembles reveal properties closely mirroring the idealized Dicke scenario.</description>

Abstract: ZX-diagrams are a powerful graphical language for the description of quantum processes with applications in fundamental quantum mechanics, quantum circuit optimization, tensor network simulation, and many more. The utility of ZX-diagrams relies on a set of local transformation rules that can be applied to them without changing the underlying quantum process they describe. These rules can be exploited to optimize the structure of ZX-diagrams for a range of applications. However, finding an optimal sequence of transformation rules is generally an open problem. In this work, we bring together ZX-diagrams with reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique designed to discover an optimal sequence of actions in a decision-making problem and show that a trained reinforcement learning agent can significantly outperform other optimization techniques like a greedy strategy or simulated annealing. The use of graph neural networks to encode the policy of the agent enables generalization to diagrams much bigger than seen during the training phase.</description>

      <title>Cutting circuits with multiple two-qubit unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiprobabilistic cutting techniques allow us to partition large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits by replacing non-local gates with probabilistic mixtures of local gates. The cost of this method is a sampling overhead that scales exponentially in the number of cuts. It is crucial to determine the minimal cost for gate cutting and to understand whether allowing for classical communication between subcircuits can improve the sampling overhead. In this work, we derive a closed formula for the optimal sampling overhead for cutting an arbitrary number of two-qubit unitaries and provide the corresponding decomposition. Interestingly, cutting several arbitrary two-qubit unitaries together is cheaper than cutting them individually and classical communication does not give any advantage. This is even the case when one cuts multiple non-local gates that are placed far apart in the circuit.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk on simplicial complexes for simplicial community detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum walks have emerged as a transformative paradigm in quantum information processing and can be applied to various graph problems. This study explores discrete-time quantum walks on simplicial complexes, a higher-order generalization of graph structures. Simplicial complexes, encoding higher-order interactions through simplices, offer a richer topological representation of complex systems. Since the conventional classical random walk cannot directly detect community structures, we present a quantum walk algorithm to detect higher-order community structures called simplicial communities. We utilize the Fourier coin to produce entangled translation states among adjacent simplices in a simplicial complex. The potential of our quantum algorithm is tested on Zachary's karate club network. This study may contribute to understanding complex systems at the intersection of algebraic topology and quantum walk algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Repeaters with Ensemble-based Quantum Memories and Single-spin Photon Transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable quantum communication over hundreds of kilometers is a daunting yet necessary requirement for a quantum internet. To overcome photon loss, the deployment of quantum repeater stations between distant network nodes is necessary. A plethora of different quantum hardware is being developed for this purpose, each platform with its own opportunities and challenges. Here, we propose to combine two promising hardware platforms in a hybrid quantum repeater architecture to lower the cost and boost the performance of long-distance quantum communication. We outline how ensemble-based quantum memories combined with single-spin photon transducers, which can transfer quantum information between a photon and a single spin, can facilitate massive multiplexing, efficient photon generation, and quantum logic for amplifying communication rates. As a specific example, we describe how a single Rubidium (Rb) atom coupled to nanophotonic resonators can function as a high-rate, telecom-visible entangled photon source with the visible photon being compatible with storage in a Thulium-doped crystal memory (Tm-memory) and the telecom photon being compatible with low loss fiber propagation. We experimentally verify that Tm and Rb transitions are in resonance with each other. Our analysis shows that by employing up to 9 repeater stations, each equipped with two Tm-memories capable of holding up to 625 storage modes, along with four single Rb atoms, one can reach a quantum communication rate of about 10 secret bits per second across distances of up to 1000 km.</description>

Abstract: Optimal control of closed quantum systems is a well studied geometrically elegant set of computational theory and techniques that have proven pivotal in the implementation and understanding of quantum computers. The design of a circuit itself corresponds to an optimal control problem of choosing the appropriate set of gates (which appear as control operands) in order to steer a qubit from an initial, easily prepared state, to one that is informative to the user in some sense, for e.g., an oracle whose evaluation is part of the circuit. However, contemporary devices are known to be noisy, and it is not certain that a circuit will behave as intended. Yet, although the computational tools exist in broader optimal control theory, robustness of adequate operation of a quantum control system with respect to uncertainty and errors has not yet been broadly studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new approach inspired by the closed quantum optimal control and its connection to geometric interpretations. To this end, we present the appropriate problem definitions of robustness in the context of quantum control, focusing on its broader implications for gate complexity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) are at the forefront of image-generating quantum machine learning models. To accommodate the growing demand for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to train and infer quantum machine learning models, the number of third-party vendors offering quantum hardware as a service is expected to rise. This expansion introduces the risk of untrusted vendors potentially stealing proprietary information from the quantum machine learning models. To address this concern we propose a novel watermarking technique that exploits the noise signature embedded during the training phase of qGANs as a non-invasive watermark. The watermark is identifiable in the images generated by the qGAN allowing us to trace the specific quantum hardware used during training hence providing strong proof of ownership. To further enhance the security robustness, we propose the training of qGANs on a sequence of multiple quantum hardware, embedding a complex watermark comprising the noise signatures of all the training hardware that is difficult for adversaries to replicate. We also develop a machine learning classifier to extract this watermark robustly, thereby identifying the training hardware (or the suite of hardware) from the images generated by the qGAN validating the authenticity of the model. We note that the watermark signature is robust against inferencing on hardware different than the hardware that was used for training. We obtain watermark extraction accuracy of 100% and ~90% for training the qGAN on individual and multiple quantum hardware setups (and inferencing on different hardware), respectively. Since parameter evolution during training is strongly modulated by quantum noise, the proposed watermark can be extended to other quantum machine learning models as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with nearest neighbor interactions. Based on matrix product state simulations and symmetry considerations, we find evidence that, with ferromagnetic isotropic couplings, the model realizes a chiral spin liquid, characterized by a possible $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ chiral topological order. This is supported by simulations on both cylinder and strip geometries. On infinitely long cylinders with various widths, scaling analysis of entanglement entropy and maximal correlation length suggests that the model has a gapped 2D bulk. The topological entanglement entropy is extracted and found to be in agreement with the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological order. On infinitely long strips with moderate widths, we find the model is critical with a central charge consistent with the chiral edge theory of the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological phase. We conclude by discussing several open questions.</description>

Abstract: A new finite form of de Finetti's representation theorem is established using elementary information-theoretic tools. The distribution of the first $k$ random variables in an exchangeable vector of $n\geq k$ random variables is close to a mixture of product distributions. Closeness is measured in terms of the relative entropy and an explicit bound is provided. This bound is tighter than those obtained via earlier information-theoretic proofs, and its utility extends to random variables taking values in general spaces. The core argument employed has its origins in the quantum information-theoretic literature.</description>

      <title>Mixed boundary conditions and Double-trace like deformations in Celestial holography and Wedge-like holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT dictionary, adding a relevant double-trace deformation $f\int O^2$ to a holographic CFT action is dual to imposing mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions for the field dual to $O$ in AdS. We observed similar behaviour in codimension-two flat space holographies. We consider deformations of boundary conditions in flat spacetimes under flat space co-dimension-two holographies, celestial holography and Wedge-like holography. In the former celestial-holographic approach, we imposed boundary conditions on initial and final bulk states in the scattering. We find that these non-trivial boundary conditions in the bulk induce "double deformations" on the Celestial CFT side, which can be understood as an analogy of double trace deformations in the usual AdS/CFT. We compute two-point bulk scattering amplitudes under the non-trivial deformed boundary conditions. In the latter Wedge-like holography approach, we consider mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions on the null infinity of the light-cone. We find that this mixing induces a renormalization flow in the dual Wedge CFT side under the Wedge holography, as in the usual AdS/CFT. We argue that the discrepancy between the Wedge two-point function and the Celestial two-point function originates from a sensitivity of bulk massless fields to a regularization parameter to use the usual AdS/CFT techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elementary point charge excitations in 3+1D topological phases can condense along a line and form a descendant excitation called the Cheshire string. Unlike the elementary flux loop excitations in the system, Cheshire strings do not have to appear as the boundary of a 2d disc and can exist on open line segments. On the other hand, Cheshire strings are different from trivial excitations that can be created with local unitaries in 0d and finite depth quantum circuits in 1d and higher. In this paper, we show that to create a Cheshire string, one needs a linear depth circuit that acts sequentially along the length of the string. Once a Cheshire string is created, its deformation, movement and fusion can be realized by finite depths circuits. This circuit depth requirement applies to all nontrivial descendant excitations including symmetry-protected topological chains and the Majorana chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Magnon-Polariton spectroscopy of strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations in LiHoF4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first present a formalism that incorporates the input-output formalism and the linear response theory to employ cavity-magnon-polariton coupling as a spectroscopic tool for investigating strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin excitations. A microscopic relation between the generalized susceptibility and the scattering parameter |S11| in strongly hybridized cavity-magnon-polariton systems has been derived without resorting to semi-classical approximations. The formalism is then applied to both analyze and simulate a specific systems comprising a model quantum Ising magnet (LiHoF4) and a high-finesse 3D re-entrant cavity resonator. Quantitative information on the electro-nuclear spin states in LiHoF4 is extracted, and the experimental observations across a broad parameter range were numerically reproduced, including an external magnetic field titraversing a quantum critical point. The method potentially opens a new avenue not only for further studies on the quantum phase transition in LiHoF4 but also for a wide range of complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for Bose-Hubbard models on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm capable of simulating the Bose-Hubbard model on arbitrary graphs, obviating the need for devising lattice-specific updates for different input graphs. We show that with our method, which is based on the recently introduced Permutation Matrix Representation Quantum Monte Carlo [Gupta, Albash and Hen, J. Stat. Mech. (2020) 073105], the problem of adapting the simulation to a given geometry amounts to generating a cycle basis for the graph on which the model is defined, a procedure that can be carried out efficiently and and in an automated manner. To showcase the versatility of our approach, we provide simulation results for Bose-Hubbard models defined on two-dimensional lattices as well as on a number of random graphs.</description>

      <title>Boosting Defect Detection in Manufacturing using Tensor Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defect detection is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in the quality control stage in the manufacturing sector. In this work, we introduce a Tensor Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) and examine its performance on a real defect detection application in one of the components of the ultrasonic sensors produced at Robert Bosch's manufacturing plants. Our quantum-inspired T-CNN operates on a reduced model parameter space to substantially improve the training speed and performance of an equivalent CNN model without sacrificing accuracy. More specifically, we demonstrate how T-CNNs are able to reach the same performance as classical CNNs as measured by quality metrics, with up to fifteen times fewer parameters and 4% to 19% faster training times. Our results demonstrate that the T-CNN greatly outperforms the results of traditional human visual inspection, providing value in a current real application in manufacturing.</description>

      <title>From Qubits to Opinions: Operator and Error Syndrome Measurement in Quantum-Inspired Social Simulations on Transversal Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the history and integration of quantum theory into areas such as opinion dynamics, decision theory, and game theory, offering a novel framework for social simulations. It introduces a quantum perspective for analyzing information transfer and decision-making complexity within social systems, employing a toric code-based method for error discrimination.Central to this research is the use of toric codes, originally for quantum error correction, to detect and correct errors in social simulations, representing uncertainty in opinion formation and decision-making processes. Operator and error syndrome measurement, vital in quantum computation, help identify and analyze errors and uncertainty in social simulations. The paper also discusses fault-tolerant computation employing transversal gates, which protect against errors during quantum computation. In social simulations, transversal gates model protection from external interference and misinformation, enhancing the fidelity of decision-making and strategy formation processes.</description>

      <title>An Effective Theory for Graphene Nanoribbons with Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum electronics. In this scenario, qubits are realised by localised states that can emerge on junctions in hybrid ribbons formed by two armchair nanoribbons of different widths. We derive an effective theory based on a tight-binding ansatz for the description of hybrid nanoribbons and use it to make accurate predictions of the energy gap and nature of the localisation in various hybrid nanoribbon geometries. We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that the effective theory remains applicable in the presence of Hubbard interactions. We discover, in addition to the well known localisations on junctions, which we call `Fuji', a new type of `Kilimanjaro' localisation smeared out over a segment of the hybrid ribbon. We show that Fuji localisations in hybrids of width $N$ and $N+2$ armchair nanoribbons occur around symmetric junctions if and only if $N\pmod3=1$, while edge-aligned junctions never support strong localisation. This behaviour cannot be explained relying purely on the topological $Z_2$ invariant, which has been believed the origin of the localisations to date.</description>

      <title>Approach to Toric Code Anyon Excitation, Indirect Effects of Kitaev Spin in Local Social Opinion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of Opinion Dynamics, which explores how individual opinions and beliefs evolve and how societal consensus is formed, has been examined across social science, physics, and mathematics. Historically based on statistical physics models like the Ising model, recent research integrates quantum information theory concepts, such as Graph States, Stabilizer States, and Toric Codes. These quantum approaches offer fresh perspectives for analyzing complex relationships and interactions in opinion formation, such as modeling local interactions, using topological features for error resistance, and applying quantum mechanics for deeper insights into opinion polarization and entanglement. However, these applications face challenges in complexity, interpretation, and empirical validation. Quantum concepts are abstract and not easily translated into social science contexts, and direct observation of social opinion processes differs significantly from quantum experiments, leading to a gap between theoretical models and real-world applicability. Despite its potential, the practical use of the Toric Code Hamiltonian in Opinion Dynamics requires further exploration and research.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach for cluster perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach (ChePSMPS) as a solver for cluster perturbation theory (CPT), crucial for simulating spectral functions in two-dimensional electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling systems. ChePSMPS distinguishes itself from conventional exact diagonalization solvers by supporting larger clusters, thereby significantly mitigating finite-size effects. Free from the fermion sign problem, ChePSMPS enhances its ability to explore $e$-ph effects and generate high-resolution spectral functions in doped Mott insulators. We use this method to simulate the spectra for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein models, highlighting its superiority over other methods. Our findings validate ChePSMPS as a powerful and reliable Green's function solver. In conjunction with embedding methods, ChePSMPS emerges as an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated $e$-ph coupling systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Floquet flat band and heating suppression via two-rate drive protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of exact Floquet flat bands implying strong violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a large class of closed quantum many-body systems in the presence of a two-rate drive characterized by frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2=\nu \Omega_1$. We provide the exact analytic condition for this phenomenon to occur for a generic protocol; in particular, $\nu=(2p+1)$, where $p$ is an integer, leads to such flat bands for both square-pulse and cosine drive protocols for arbitrary $\Omega_1$. In the vicinity of these points, heating is suppressed up to very long timescales in such driven systems, leading to a prethermal regime; we demonstrate this by exact numerical studies of distribution and bandwidth of the Floquet eigenstates, spectral form factor, entanglement entropy, and correlation functions of an experimentally realizable finite driven Rydberg chain. The corresponding micromotion exhibits coherent reversal of excitations reminiscent of echoes. Our analysis constitutes a yet unexplored mechanism for heating suppression in driven closed quantum systems.</description>
