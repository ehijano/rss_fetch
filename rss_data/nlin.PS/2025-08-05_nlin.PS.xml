      <title>Soliton Transitions Mediated by Skin-Mode Localization and Band Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons, typically resulting from a competition between band dispersion and nonlinearity, occur in lattices featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect as nonlinearity increases, accompanied by a transition in localization from linear skin modes to solitons. However, localization does not disentangle the role of skin modes in the soliton formation from that of band dispersion. Here, in such lattices, we uncover two distinct soliton phases, skin-mode-assisted solitons (SMASs) and nonreciprocity-dressed solitons (NRDSs). Rooted in fundamentally different mechanisms, SMASs originate from skin effect, while NRDSs stem from band nonreciprocity, each exhibiting unique spatial profiles. Using a stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like model as a prototype, we delineate the phase diagram of SMASs and NRDSs, each having clear phase boundaries. To interpret them, we formulate a Wannier-function-based nonlinear Hamiltonian, showing that soliton formation depends critically on how skin-mode localization and band nonreciprocity suppress or enhance wave dispersion. For SMASs, skin-mode localization reduces wave broadening at the localization sites, thereby lowering the formation threshold. This soliton phase is observable from edge dynamics and accompanied by a dynamical stability reentrance when transitioning from linear skin modes. In contrast, NRDSs, as well as their thresholds, originate from bulk band nonreciprocity and persist under periodic boundary conditions. Our framework offers predictive tools for characterizing and engineering solitons in experimentally realizable non-Hermitian systems, spanning optics to mechanics.</description>

      <title>Cascade Crack in Chain of Beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a homogeneous chain of spheres linked by liquid bridges under tension. The rupture of a single liquid bridge leads to a fragmentation cascade driven by the inverse relation between the capillary force and the sphere distances. The initial length of the liquid bridges determines the number and size of the fragments and the velocity of the fragmentation front.</description>

      <title>Parametric pair production of collective excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observation with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.</description>

      <title>Theory of dispersive shock waves induced by the Raman effect in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dispersive shock waves in optical fibers for the case of long-distance propagation of optical pulses, when the small Raman effect stabilizes the profile of the shock. The Whitham modulation equations are derived as the basis for the Gurevich-Pitaevskii approach to the analytical theory of such shocks. We show that the wave variables at both sides of the shock are related by the analogue of the Rankine-Hugoniot condition that follows from the conservation laws of the Whitham equations. Solutions of the Whitham equations yield the profiles of the wave variables that agree very well with the exact numerical solution of the generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equation for propagation of optical pulses.</description>

      <title>Most likely retail agglomeration patterns: Potential maximization and stochastic stability of spatial equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a model of retail agglomeration where consumers are more likely to visit zones with a higher concentration of shops. This agglomerative effect makes zones with many retailers more attractive. The spatial distribution of retailers in equilibrium is endogenously determined in response to the spatial pattern of shopping demand. In such a setting, multiple locally stable equilibria may arise, and the outcome can depend on the initial distribution of shops. To address this issue, we apply an approach from evolutionary game theory, selecting the equilibrium that maximizes a potential function representing the incentives of retailers. We demonstrate the method in a two-dimensional spatial setting. Compared to local stability based on gradual, myopic adjustments, this global maximization leads to a unique and more robust prediction. As expected, the number of retail clusters decreases either when shopping costs for immobile consumers fall or when the attractiveness of larger retail concentrations increases.</description>
