      <title>Shift and Polarization of Excitons from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a long history, certain aspects of excitons - the bound inter-band states which form when a valence band hole and a conduction band electron pair - have remained relatively unexplored. This holds particularly true for the wavefunction of an exciton, for which few properties have been explored theoretically in various limiting cases. An intuitive language robustly characterizing the topology of bound electron-hole states is lacking, but needed in order to address the global features of the charge distribution of the excitonic state, to properly understand their transport theory, and to supplement the numerical investigation of excitons in ab-initio approaches. Here, we address these gaps by developing a comprehensive framework for the quantum geometry and topology of two-dimensional exciton states in terms of the exact connections which describe the interaction-renormalized exciton bundle in a periodic lattice. Based on this description, we derive two gauge-invariant quantities, which we identify as the exciton shift vector and the exciton dipole vector. Using the shift vector, we elucidate the topology of exciton bands compared to the topology of the parent electronic band structure, pinpointing precisely how interactions can introduce nontrivial topology to the exciton bands beyond the topology which is contained in the single-particle bands. We further elucidate how shift and polarizations enter into the semiclassical equations of motion for the exciton center of mass coordinates.</description>

      <title>Dephasing of planar Ge hole spin qubits due to 1/$\textit{f}$ charge noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in Ge, investigated for all-electrical spin manipulation because of its large spin-orbit coupling, are exposed to charge noise leading to decoherence. Here we construct a model of $1/f$ noise from individual fluctuators and determine the dephasing time $T_2^*$ as a function of qubit properties. $T_2^*$ decreases with increasing magnetic field and is an order of magnitude longer for out-of-plane than for in-plane fields for the same Zeeman energy. $T_2^*$ shows little variation as a function of the top gate field and is a complex function of the dot radius. Our results should help experiments to enhance coherence in hole qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>A single spin in hexagonal boron nitride for vectorial quantum magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing based on solid-state spin defects provides a uniquely versatile platform for imaging physical properties at the nanoscale under diverse environmental conditions. Operation of most sensors used to-date is based on projective measurement along a single axis combined with computational extrapolation. Here, we show that the individually addressable carbon-related spin defect in hexagonal boron nitride is a multi-axis spin system for vectorial nanoscale magnetometry. We demonstrate how its low symmetry and strongly spin-selective direct and reverse intersystem crossing dynamics provide sub-$\mu$T/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ magnetic-field sensitivity for both on and off-axis bias magnetic field exceeding 50 mT. Alongside these features, the room-temperature operation and the nanometer-scale proximity enabled by the van der Waals host material further consolidate this system as an exciting quantum sensing platform.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Straintronics and Mechanical Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Quasi-metallic SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are effectively narrow ribbons of 2D materials with atomically precise edges. They are ideal systems to harness quantum transport straintronics (QTS), i.e. using mechanical strain to control quantum transport. Their large subband energy spacing ($\sim$ 0.8 eV) leads to transistors with a single quantum transport channel. We adapt an applied model to study QTS in uniaxially-strained quasi-metallic-SWCNT transistors. The device parameters are based on an existing experimental platform, with channel lengths of $L=$ 50 nm, diameters $d\approx$ 1.5 nm, and strains up to $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}\approx$ 7 $\%$. We demonstrate that the charge carrier's propagation angle $\Theta$ is fully tunable with $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}$. When $\Theta$ reaches 90$^o$, the conductance $G$ is completely suppressed. A strain-generated band gap can be tuned up to $\approx$ 400 meV. Mechanical strain adds both scalar $\phi_{\varepsilon}$ and vector $\textbf{A}$ gauge potentials to the transistor's Hamiltonian. These potentials create a rich spectrum of quantum interferences in $G$, which can be described as a mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect. The charge carriers' quantum phase can be controlled by purely mechanical means. For instance, a full 2$\pi$ phase shift can be induced in a (12,9) tube by a 0.7 $\%$ strain change. This work opens opportunities to add quantitative quantum transport strain effects to the tools box of quantum technologies based on 2D materials and their nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Physical Limits of Specific Absorption Rate in Hyperthermia Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticle-based hyperthermia has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for treating malignant solid tumors that exhibit resistance to conventional cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation. Despite the clinical approval of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for the adjunct treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, their therapeutic potential is undercut by chemical synthesis-inherent limitations such as low saturation magnetization, superparamagnetic characteristics, and a wide nanoparticle size distribution. Here, we introduce an micromagnetic modelling-based SAF-MDP design with in-plane magnetization, optimized through specific uniaxial anisotropy adjustments to avert the spin-flop phenomenon and eliminate hysteresis-free hard-axis magnetization loops, paired with a mechanofluidic modeling approach to assess the alignment of the SAF-MDP to the applied alternating magnetic field (AMF). Magnetic Force Microscopy characterization provides unprecedented insights into the particle switching behaviour on a single particle scale. This comprehensive strategy spanning micromagnetics and advanced magnetic characterization enables the design of particles with heating efficiencies to approach the theoretical maximum, dictated by the saturation magnetization of the utilized materials and limited solely by the biologically acceptable frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field. Our work not only addresses the limitations encountered by previous methodologies but also sets the stage for the development of advanced SAF-MDP designs and alignment techniques. This opens a new avenue to hyperthermia-based cancer therapy, delineated only by the boundaries of physical laws and biological safety standards.</description>

      <title>Viscous hydrodynamics of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in semiconductors can form a variety of collective states leading to different regimes of exciton propagation. Here we theoretically demonstrate the possibility to reach the viscous hydrodynamic -- liquid-like -- regime of exciton propagation in two-dimensional materials, focusing on the mono- and bi-layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. This regime can be realized where the exciton-exciton collisions dominate over exciton-phonon and disorder scattering. We have derived the hydrodynamic-like set of equations describing viscous flow of interacting excitons based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the exciton distribution function. A comparison of various exciton propagation regimes including diffusive, viscous hydrodynamic, and superfluid regime is presented. Conditions which allow one to observe the hydrodynamic regime of exciton transport, and the role of material are discussed.</description>

      <title>Transverse Spin current at the normal/p-wave altermagnet junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transmission properties of a junction between a normal metal and a p-wave altermagnet in the ballistic regime. We introduce a two-dimensional square lattice that confirms the p-wave altermagnet criteria. The $\alpha$-vector of the altermagnet breaks the inversion symmetry of the parabolic dispersion, shifting them in k-space. These shifts alter the propagation direction of fermions passing through the junction interface. Depending on spin orientation, the transmission process exhibits anisotropic, angle-dependent behavior. We also demonstrate a mirror symmetry between fermions with opposite spin directions, leading to the emergence of a transverse spin current that flows parallel to the interface. Additionally, we show that the $\alpha$-vector acts as a source for the dynamics of the spin-density wave and observe the formation of an indirect gap in the conductance of the junction. Our findings highlight the unique transmission characteristics and spin transport phenomena in normal metal/p-wave altermagnet junctions, paving the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral edge mode for single-cone Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the appearance of a chiral edge mode on the two-dimensional (2D) surface of a 3D topological insulator (TI). The edge mode appears along the 1D boundary with a magnetic insulator (MI), dependent on the angle $\theta$ which the magnetization $M$ makes with the normal to surface and on the chemical potential mismatch $\delta\mu$ across the TI--MI interface (assuming $1&gt;\delta\mu/M\equiv\sin\phi)$. The propagation along the interface is chiral, with velocity $v\cos(\theta-\phi)$ smaller than the Dirac fermion velocity $v$. In momentum space the edge mode is an arc state, extending over the finite momentum interval that connects the Dirac point of the gapless Dirac fermions with the magnetic band gap. An electric field parallel to the boundary pumps charge between TI and MI via this arc state.</description>

      <title>Magneto tunnel conductance across twisted Weyl semimetal junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetotransport across an interface between two Weyl semimetals (finite in both directions) whose Weyl nodes project onto two different surfaces which are twisted with respect to each other before being coupled. This gives rise to a novel contribution to the conductance through the junction purely through Fermi arc states, even in the absence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the junction. When the perpendicular magnetic field is included, we find that for a mesoscopic or smaller samples, the transverse Fermi arc states have a significant contribution to the conductance for experimentally relevant fields, and need to be taken into account along with the conductance through the bulk chiral Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Thermal crossover from a Chern insulator to a fractional Chern insulator in pentalayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By theoretically analyzing the recent temperature dependent transport data in pentalayer graphene [Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203], we establish that the experimentally observed transition from low-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect to higher-temperature fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect is a crossover phenomenon arising from the competition between interaction and disorder energy scales, with the likely zero temperature ground state of the system being either a localized insulator or a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall effect. In particular, the intriguing suppression of FQAHE in favor of QAHE with decreasing temperature is explained as arising from the low-temperature localization of the carriers where disorder overcomes the interaction effects. We provide a detailed analysis of the data in support of the crossover scenario.</description>

      <title>Insulator-Metal Transition and Magnetic Crossover in Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Emergent cavity junction around metal-on-graphene contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing graphene devices for applications relies on a comprehensive understanding of how to interact with them. Specifically, scattering processes at the interface with metallic contacts can induce reproducible abnormalities in measurements. Here, we report on emergent transport signatures appearing when contacting sub-micrometer high-quality metallic top contacts to graphene. Using electrostatic simulations and first-principle calculations, we reveal their origin: the contact induces an n-doped radial cavity around it, which is cooperatively defined by the metal-induced electrostatic potential and Klein tunneling. This intricate mechanism leads to secondary resistance peaks as a function of graphene doping that decreases with increasing contact size. Interestingly, in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, the cavity spawns a distinct set of Landau levels that interferes with the Landau fan emanating from the graphene bulk. Essentially, an emergent 'second bulk' forms around the contact, as a result of the interplay between the magnetic field and the contact-induced electrostatic potential. The interplay between the intrinsic and emergent bulks leads to direct observation of bulk-boundary correspondence in our experiments. Our work unveils the microscopic mechanisms manifesting at metal-graphene interfaces, opening new avenues for understanding and devising graphene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multifractal statistics of non-Hermitian skin effect on the Cayley tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the single-particle skin states on the Cayley tree. This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate inter-valley coherent states in ABC graphene: collective modes and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in ABC trilayer graphene detected superconductivity on the border of a phase transition to a symmetry-broken phase. In this work, we use unrestricted Hartree-Fock to study the nature of this phase. We find a close competition between two incommensurate inter-valley coherent (IVC) phases: an IVC crystal where the ordering occurs at multiple wavevectors, and an IVC spiral with a single ordering wavevector. Focusing on one of the regimes where superconductivity is observed experimentally, we find a continuous (or very weakly first order) transition between a half metallic phase to an IVC crystal, followed by a first-order transition into an IVC spiral. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we study the collective mode spectrum in the half-metalic phase. We find a soft inter-valley mode that can mediate superconductivity in a narrow sliver of density near the continuous transition, with a Tc that can reach a few hundreds of mK and a sign-changing s-wave order parameter. The spin stiffness in the half metal phase is found to be surprisingly low, of the order of a few degrees Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model at quarter filling: effects of magnetic field and non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay and competition of topology and electron-electron interactions have fascinated researchers since the discovery of topological insulators. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard (SSSHH) model is a prototypical model which includes both non-trivial topology and interactions. Due to its simplicity, there are several artificial quantum systems which can realize such a model to a good approximation. Here we focus on the quarter-filled case, where interactions and dimerization open a charge gap. In particular, we study the single-particle spectral function for the extended SSHH model with magnetic field and explore several parameter limits where effective model descriptions arise. In the strongly-dimerized limit, we show that the low-energy excitations of the spectral function resemble a half-filled Hubbard model with effective dimer sites and renormalized couplings. For strong magnetic field and interactions, we find physics akin to the spinless Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model at half filling, featuring a non-interacting topological phase transition. Moreover, in light of the recent realization of this model in quantum dot simulation, we provide evidence for the stability of the topological phase towards moderate non-local interactions in the experimentally expected parameter range.</description>

      <title>Hall Transport in Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a universal theory to understand quasiparticle Hall effects and transverse charge-carrier transport in organic semiconductors. The simulations are applied to organic crystals inspired by rubrene and cover multiple transport regimes. This includes calculations of the intrinsic Hall conductivity in pristine crystals, which are connected with a simple description of semi-classical electron transport that involves the concept of closed electronic orbits in the band structure, which can be easily calculated in density functional theory. Furthermore, this framework is employed to simulate temperature-dependent longitudinal and transverse mobilities in rubrene. These simulations are compared to experimental findings, providing insights into these results by characterizing the non-ideality of the Hall effect due to the influence of vibrational disorder. We finally investigate the conditions for the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal resistivity and quantized Hall plateaus in the transverse resistivity. A clear picture why this is not observed in rubrene is developed. These insights into classical and quantum Hall effects and their intermediates in organic semiconductors establish a blueprint for future explorations in similar systems.</description>

Abstract: Azide functionalization produced luminescent sp2-type defects on single-walled carbon nanotubes, by which defect photoluminescence appeared in near infrared regions (1116 nm). Changes in exciton properties were induced by localization effects at the defect sites, creating exciton-engineered nanomaterials based on the defect structure design.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature cavity exciton-polariton condensation in perovskite quantum dots</title>

Abstract: The exploitation of the strong light-matter coupling regime and exciton-polariton condensates has emerged as a compelling approach to introduce strong interactions and nonlinearities into numerous photonic applications, ranging from low-threshold topological lasers to ultrafast all-optical logic devices. The use of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots with strong three-dimensional confinement as the active material in these microcavities would be highly advantageous due to their versatile structural and compositional tunability and wet-chemical processability, as well as potentially enhanced, confinement-induced polaritonic interactions. Yet, to date, cavity exciton-polariton condensation has neither been achieved with epitaxial nor with colloidal quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature polariton condensation in a thin film of monodisperse, colloidal CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots placed in a tunable optical resonator with a Gaussian-shaped deformation serving as wavelength-scale potential well for the polaritons. The onset of polariton condensation under pulsed optical excitation is manifested in emission by its characteristic superlinear intensity dependence, reduced linewidth, blueshift, and extended temporal coherence. Our results, based on this highly engineerable class of perovskite materials with unique optical properties, pave the way for the development of polaritonic devices for ultrabright coherent light sources and photonic information processing.</description>

      <title>Development of a Nb-based semiconductor-superconductor hybrid platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid materials are used as a platform to realise Andreev bound states, which hold great promise for quantum applications. These states require transparent interfaces between the semiconductor and superconductor, which are typically realised by in-situ deposition of an Al superconducting layer. Here we present a hybrid material based on an InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) combined with in-situ deposited Nb and NbTi superconductors, which offer a larger operating range in temperature and magnetic field due to their larger superconducting gap. We overcome the inherent difficulty associated with the formation of an amorphous interface between III-V semiconductors and Nb-based superconductors by introducing a 7 nm Al interlayer. The Al interlayer provides an epitaxial connection between an in-situ magnetron sputtered Nb or NbTi thin film and a shallow InAs 2DEG. This metal-to-metal epitaxy is achieved by optimization of the material stack and results in an induced superconducting gap of approximately 1 meV, determined from transport measurements of superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions. This induced gap is approximately five times larger than the values reported for Al-based hybrid materials and indicates the formation of highly-transparent interfaces that are required in high-quality hybrid material platforms.</description>

      <title>Error threshold in active steering protocols for few-qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study active steering protocols for weakly measured qubits in the presence of error channels due to amplitude and phase noise. If the error rate is sufficiently small, the protocol approaches and stabilizes a predesignated pure target state with high fidelity and high purity, and thus implements autonomous state stabilization. We present numerical simulation results for one and two qubits, taking Andreev qubit circuits as example. As function of the error rate, a sharp threshold separates an error-correcting weak-damping regime from a strong-damping regime where the target state cannot be reached anymore. At the threshold, the purity gap closes.</description>

Abstract: Physical neuromorphic computing, exploiting the complex dynamics of physical systems, has seen rapid advancements in sophistication and performance. Physical reservoir computing, a subset of neuromorphic computing, faces limitations due to its reliance on single systems. This constrains output dimensionality and dynamic range, limiting performance to a narrow range of tasks. Here, we engineer a suite of nanomagnetic array physical reservoirs and interconnect them in parallel and series to create a multilayer neural network architecture. The output of one reservoir is recorded, scaled and virtually fed as input to the next reservoir. This networked approach increases output dimensionality, internal dynamics and computational performance. We demonstrate that a physical neuromorphic system can achieve an overparameterised state, facilitating meta-learning on small training sets and yielding strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Our approach's efficacy is further demonstrated through few-shot learning, where the system rapidly adapts to new tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced photo-excitation and angular-momentum imprint of gray excitons in WSe$_{2}$ monolayers by spin-orbit-coupled vector vortex beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A light beam can be spatially structured in the complex amplitude to possess orbital angular momentum (OAM), which introduces a new degree of freedom alongside the intrinsic spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with circular polarization. Moreover, super-imposing two twisted lights with distinct SAM and OAM produces a vector vortex beam (VVB) in non-separable states where not only complex amplitude but also polarization are spatially structured and entangled with each other. In addition to the non-separability, the SAM and OAM in a VVB are intrinsically coupled by the optical spin-orbit interaction and constitute the profound spin-orbit physics in photonics. In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation, implemented on the first-principles base, of the intriguing light-matter interaction between VVBs and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers (WSe$_{2}$-MLs), one of the best-known and promising two-dimensional (2D) materials in optoelectronics dictated by excitons, encompassing bright exciton (BX) as well as various dark excitons (DXs). One of the key findings of our study is the substantial enhancement of the photo-excitation of gray excitons (GXs), a type of spin-forbidden dark exciton, in a WSe$_2$-ML through the utilization of a twisted light that possesses a longitudinal field associated with the optical spin-orbit interaction. Our research demonstrates that a spin-orbit-coupled VVB surprisingly allows for the imprinting of the carried optical information onto gray excitons in 2D materials, which is robust against the decoherence mechanisms in materials. This observation suggests a promising method for deciphering the transferred angular momentum from structured lights to excitons.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional spin wave emission by travelling pair of magnetic field profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12653v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spin wave Cherenkov effect can be used to design the unidirectional spin wave emitter with tunable frequency and switchable direction of emission. In our numerical studies, we propose to use a pair of traveling profiles of the magnetic field which generate the spin waves, for sufficiently large velocity of their motion. In the considered system, the spin waves of shorter (longer) wavelengths are induced at the front (back) of the moving profiles and interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the velocity of the profiles. Moreover, we showed that the spin waves can be confined between the pair of traveling profiles of the magnetic field. This work opens the perspectives for the experimental studies in hybrid magnonic-superconducting systems where the magnetic vortices in a superconductor can be used as moving sources of the magnetic field driving the spin waves in the ferromagnetic subsystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chaotic light source is characterized by the fact that many independent emitters radiate photons with a random optical phase. This is similar compared to a tunnel junction where many independent channels are able to emit photons due to a coupling to an electromagnetic environment. However, in a recent experiment it has been observed that a tunnel junction can deviate from the expectation of chaotic light and is able to emit strongly correlated, superbunched photons. Motivated by this, we study the correlation of the radiation and show that the superbunching originates from the emission of multiple photons which is possible due to the quantization of charge.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian zero-energy pinning of Andreev and Majorana bound states in superconductor-semiconductor systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of Majorana bound states in finite length superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems has been predicted to occur in the form of oscillatory energy levels with parity crossings around zero energy. Each zero-energy crossing is expected to produce a quantized zero-bias conductance peak but several studies have reported conductance peaks pinned at zero energy over a range of Zeeman fields, whose origin, however, is not clear. In this work we consider superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling under a Zeeman field and demonstrate that non-Hermitian effects, due to coupling to ferromagnet leads, induce zero-energy pinning of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states. We find that this zero-energy pinning effect occurs due to the formation of non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points, whose emergence can be controlled by the interplay of non-Hermiticity, the applied Zeeman field, and chemical potentials. Moreover, depending on the non-Hermitian spatial profile, we find that non-Hermiticity changes the single point Hermitian topological phase transition into a flattened zero energy line bounded by exceptional points from multiple low energy levels. This seemingly innocent change notably enables a gap closing well below the Hermitian topological phase transition, which can be in principle simpler to achieve. Furthermore, we reveal that the energy gap separating Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states from the quasicontinuum remains robust for the values that give rise to the zero-energy pinning effect. While reasonable values of non-Hermiticity can be indeed beneficial, very strong non-Hermitian effects can be detrimental as it might destroy superconductivity. Our findings can be therefore useful for understanding the zero-energy pinning of trivial and topological states in Majorana devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions that carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped ``flag'' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that such uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (i) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (ii) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (iii) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave the way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthetic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene II: General Mechanism and a Minimal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal "three-patch model" for the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), a topological electronic state that spontaneously breaks both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translation symmetry. The proposal for this state is inspired by the recently observed integer and fractional quantum Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. There, interaction effects appear to amplify the effects of a weak moir\'e potential, leading to the formation of stable, isolated Chern bands. It has been further shown that Chern bands are stabilized in mean field calculations even without a moir\'e potential, enabling a realization of the AHC state. Our model is built upon the dissection of the Brillouin zone into patches centered around high symmetry points. Within this model, the wavefunctions at high symmetry points fully determine the topology and energetics of the state. We extract two quantum geometrical phases of the non-interacting wavefunctions that control the stability of the topologically nontrivial AHC state. The model predicts that the AHC state wins over the topological trivial Wigner crystal in a wide range of parameters, and agrees very well with the results of full self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations of the rhombohedral multilayer graphene Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The geometry of the Hermitian matrix space and the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the Schrieffer--Wolff (SW) transformation (also called quasi-degenerate perturbation theory) is known as an approximative method to reduce the dimension of the Hamiltonian. We present a geometric interpretation of the SW transformation: We prove that it induces a local coordinate chart in the space of Hermitian matrices near a $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold. Inspired by this result, we establish a `distance theorem': we show that the standard deviation of $k$ neighboring eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian equals the distance of this Hamiltonian from the corresponding $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold, divided by $\sqrt{k}$. Furthermore, we investigate one-parameter perturbations of a degenerate Hamiltonian, and prove that the standard deviation and the pairwise differences of the eigenvalues lead to the same order of splitting of the energy eigenvalues, which in turn is the same as the order of distancing from the degeneracy submanifold. As applications, we prove the `protection' of Weyl points using the transversality theorem, and infer geometrical properties of certain degeneracy submanifolds based on results from quantum error correction and topological order.</description>
