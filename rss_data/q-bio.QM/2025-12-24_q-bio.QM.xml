      <title>Methods for Analyzing RNA Pseudoknots via Chord Diagrams and Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA molecules are known to form complex secondary structures including pseudoknots. A systematic framework for the enumeration, classification and prediction of secondary structures is critical to determine the biological significance of the molecular configurations of RNA. Chord diagrams are mathematical objects widely used to represent RNA secondary structures and to analyze structural motifs, however a mathematically rigorous enumeration of pseudoknots remains a challenge. We introduce a method that incorporates a distance-based metric $\tau$ to analyze the intersection graph of a chord diagram associated with a pseudoknotted structure. In particular, our method formally defines a pseudoknot in terms of a weighted vertex cover of a certain intersection graph constructed from a partition of the chord diagram representing the nucleotide sequence of the RNA molecule. In this graph-theoretic context, we introduce a rigorous algorithm that enumerates pseudoknots, classifies secondary structures, and is sensitive to three-dimensional topological features. We implement our methods in MATLAB and test the algorithm on pseudoknotted structures from the bpRNA-1m database. Our findings confirm that genus is a robust quantifier of pseudoknot complexity.</description>

      <title>SynCraft: Guiding Large Language Models to Predict Edit Sequences for Molecular Synthesizability Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <title>Markovian Promoter Models: A Mechanistic Alternative to Hill Functions in Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks are typically modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with phenomenological Hill functions to represent transcriptional regulation. While computationally efficient, Hill functions lack mechanistic grounding and cannot capture stochastic promoter dynamics. We present a hybrid Markovian-ODE framework that explicitly models discrete promoter states while maintaining computational tractability. Our approach tracks individual transcription factor binding events as a continuous-time Markov chain, coupled with deterministic ODEs for molecular concentrations. We validate this framework on seven gene regulatory systems spanning basic to advanced complexity: the GAL system, repressilator, Goodwin oscillator, toggle switch, incoherent feed-forward loop, p53-Mdm2 oscillator, and NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Comparison with stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) ground truth demonstrates that Markovian promoter models achieve similar accuracy to full stochastic simulations while being 10-100$\times$ faster. Our framework provides a mechanistic foundation for gene regulation modeling and enables investigation of promoter-level stochasticity in complex regulatory networks.</description>
