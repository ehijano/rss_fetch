      <title>Cocycle stability in permutations of random simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cocycle stability rate of a simplicial complex measures how far cochains with small coboundaries are from actual cocycles. In this paper, we study the 1-dimensional cocycle stability rate with permutation coefficients of random 2-dimensional Linial--Meshulam complexes. Our main contribution is the following: If, in the middle traingle density range, these random complexes asymptotically almost surely have a linear cocycle stability rate, then there exists a non-sofic hyperbolic group. As no non-sofic group, nor any non-residually finite hyperbolic group, are known to exist, this opens a potential approach to both problems simultaneously. Our proof method is inspired by a well known fact about the non local testability of Sipser--Spielman expander codes.</description>

      <title>On primitivity and reduction for half-flag-transitive block designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D} = (\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{B})$ be a $2$-$(v, k, \lambda)$ design, and let $G$ be a half-flag-transitive automorphism group of ${\cal D}$. In this article, we first establish three sufficient conditions for $G$ to be point-primitive: (i) $\lambda \geq (r, 2\lambda)^2$, (ii) $r &gt; 4\lambda(k-2)$, (iii) $(v-1,2k-2)\le2$. Next, we prove that for $\lambda \geq (r, 2\lambda)^2$, the group $G$ is either of affine type, almost simple type, or product type. Finally, we analyze the case where $G$ is of almost simple type and prove that if the socle of $G$ is a sporadic simple group then $G \cong \text{HS}$ and $\cal D$ is either the unique $2$-$(176, 128, 15240)$ design or the unique $2$-$(176, 160, 19080)$ design.</description>

      <title>Normalisers of parabolic subgroups of Artin--Tits groups and Tits cone intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Coxeter diagram and let $J \subseteq \Gamma$. Motivated by 3-fold flops, Iyama and Wemyss study the hyperplane arrangement in the Tits cone intersection of $J$, which is a $J$-relative generalisation of the classical Coxeter arrangement. For $\Gamma$ of finite-type, we show that its complexified hyperplane complement is a $K(\pi,1)$ space for the normaliser (quotient) of the standard parabolic subgroup of the Artin--Tits group attached to $J$. For general $\Gamma$ we show that Brink--Howlett's groupoid, which describes normalisers of parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups, has its universal cover described by the wall-and-chamber structure of the Tits cone intersection. We use this to show that wall crossing sequences satisfy an "atomic Matsumoto relation", generalising a theorem of Ko and answering questions raised by Iyama and Wemyss.</description>

      <title>Latin quandles of size $16p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the classification of latin quandles of size $16p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. In particular we have that such quandles are always subdirectly reducible but in some cases for small primes. Specifically, we have that latin quandles of size $16p$ are affine if $p\neq 1 \pmod{3}$ or $p\neq 3,5$. If $p=1\pmod 3$ there are $2$ subdirectly reducible non directly decomposable latin quandles of size $16p$ for every prime with $p=1\pmod{3}$ and there are one subdirectly irreducible latin quandle of size $16p$ for $p=3,5$. We provide explicit constructions as coset quandles for all the quandles mentioned above.</description>

      <title>New constructions of free products and geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method for constructing new presentations of free products that give rise to previously unknown geodetic Cayley graphs. Our approach adapts subdivision techniques of Parthasarathy and Srinivasan [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 1982], which preserve geodecity at the graph level, to the setting of group presentations and rewriting systems. Specifically, given a group $G$ with geodetic Cayley graph with respect to generating set $\Sigma$ and an integer $n$, our construction produces a rewriting system presenting $G \ast F_{n|\Sigma|}$ with geodetic Cayley graph with respect to the new generating set. This framework provides new infinite families of geodetic Cayley graphs and extends the toolkit for investigating long-standing conjectures on geodetic groups.</description>

      <title>Wulff Isoperimetry on Cayley Graphs: Submodular BV, Tempered F{\o}lner, and Profile Ratio Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a BV framework on Cayley graphs, which yields a sharp discrete Wulff isoperimetric inequality with the best constant tied to the generating set/stencil $S$, a quantitative $\Gamma$-convergence of discrete to continuum anisotropic perimeter, and a gauge construction in Heisenberg group that neutralizes shear, yielding an BV+shear identity and scale-sharp compactness.
  As an application we revisit a question of Gromov (2008) on the ratio between the isoperimetric profile and its greatest nondecreasing minorant. We show that this is uniformly bounded on non-amenable and two-ended groups, and our Wulff inequality and $\Gamma$-convergence give a constant-tracked proof for virtually nilpotent groups. We isolate a Tempered F{\o}lner criterion (TF) (exhaustion principle with controlled increment), which forces bounded ratio in general. We verify (TF) in two families: finite-lamp wreath products over (TF) bases and lamplighters over amenable bases. For semidirect products $\mathbb Z^d\rtimes_A\mathbb Z$ we construct layer-nested sets of logarithmic height that are $A$-covariantly nested, F{\o}lner, and satisfy (TF)(ii) with a constant independent of $A\in\mathrm{GL}(d,\mathbb Z)$; and when $A$ is hyperbolic (no eigenvalue on the unit circle) we have full (TF). We also formulate ``gap conjectures'' that would settle the question for all amenable Cayley graphs.
  The BV viewpoint has spectral and analytic consequences: we derive constant-tracked Cheeger-type, Faber-Krahn, Nash inequalities, etc. The (TF) control further yields a tempered Property A, leading to explicit coarse embeddings into Hilbert space with compression $\rho(t) \gtrsim t^{1/2}/\log t$. Finally, we show that (TF) is a robust reflection of bi-equivariant geometry, and in virtually nilpotent classes this \emph{doubles} the sharp Wulff constant asymptotically-refining and answering another question of Gromov.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that free-by-cyclic groups with polynomially growing monodromies are conjugacy separable and that double cosets of cyclic subgroups are separable. As a corollary of our results, we show that the outer automorphism group of every polynomially growing free-by-cyclic group is residually finite.</description>

      <title>Braided dynamical groups, the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation and related structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a braided dynamical group which is a matched pair of dynamical groups satisfying extra conditions. It is shown to give a solution of the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation and at the same time a braided groupoid, thereby integrating the approaches of Andruskiewitsch and Matsumoto-Shimizu respectively that use these two notions to produce quiver-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We pursue this connection further by relative Rota-Baxter operators on dynamical groups, which give rise to matched pairs of dynamical groups. As the derived structures of relative Rota-Baxter operators on dynamical groups, dynamical post-groups are introduced and are shown to be equivalent to braided dynamical groups. Finally, skew-braces are generalized to dynamical skew-braces as another equivalent notion of braided dynamical groups.</description>

      <title>Virtual homological torsion: abundance versus growth in books of $I$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a book of $I$-bundles, all of whose pages are surfaces of negative Euler characteristic. In this short note, we prove that torsion in the first homology of $\mathcal{B}$ grows subexponentially in the index along any exhausting tower of regular finite-sheeted covers. By contrast, recent work of Ascari and the author shows that, apart from the obvious exceptions, $\mathcal{B}$ has abundant virtual homological torsion, which can grow exponentially along exhausting towers of non-regular finite covers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the \emph{permutation closure} of a multiple context-free language is multiple context-free, which extends work of Okhotin and Sorokin [LATA 2020] who showed closure under \emph{cyclic shift}, and complements work of Brandst\"adt [1981, RAIRO Inform. Th\'{e}or.] (resp. Brough \emph{et al.} [2016, Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci.]) who showed the same result for regular, context-sensitive, recursively enumerable (resp. EDT0L and ET0L) languages. In contrast to Okhotin and Sorokin who work with grammars, our proof uses restricted tree stack automata due to Denkinger [DLT 2016].</description>

      <title>Existence of integral Hopf orders in twists of group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a group-theoretical condition under which a twist of a group algebra, in Movshev's way, admits an integral Hopf order. Let $K$ be a (large enough) number field with ring of integers $R$. Let $G$ be a finite group and $M$ an abelian subgroup of $G$ of central type. Consider the twist $J$ for $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ afforded by a non-degenerate $2$-cocycle on the character group $\widehat{M}$. We show that if there is a Lagrangian decomposition $\widehat{M} \simeq L \times \widehat{L}$ such that $L$ is contained in a normal abelian subgroup $N$ of $G$, then the twisted group algebra $(K\hspace{-0.8pt}G)_J$ admits a Hopf order $X$ over $R$. The Hopf order $X$ is constructed as the $R$-submodule generated by the primitive idempotents of $K\hspace{-1.1pt}N$ and the elements of $G$. It is indeed a Hopf order of $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ such that $J^{\pm 1} \in X \otimes_R X$. Furthermore, we give some criteria for this Hopf order to be unique. We illustrate this construction with several families of examples. As an application, we provide a further example of simple and semisimple complex Hopf algebra that does not admit integral Hopf orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new criterion for proving that a language is not multiple context-free, which we call a Substitution Lemma. We apply it to show a sample selection of languages are not multiple context-free, including the word problem of $F_2\times F_2$. Our result is in contrast to Kanazawa et al. [2014, Theory Comput. Syst.] who proved that it was not possible to generalise the standard pumping lemma for context-free languages to multiple context-free languages, and Kanazawa [2019, Inform. and Comput.] who showed a weak variant of generalised Ogden's lemma does not apply to multiple context-free languages. We also record that groups with multiple context-free word problem have decidable rational subset membership problem.</description>

      <title>Complex Lies, Real Physics: The Role of Algebra Complexification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physics, Lie groups represent the algebraic structure that describes symmetry transformations of a given system. Then, the descending Lie algebra of those groups are necessary real. In most cases, the complexification of those Lie algebra is necessary in order to derive irreductible representations of the Lie algebra and subsequently of the symmetry group. In this paper, we give a precise definition of the concept and prove step by step an important result $$\left(\mathfrak{g}^\mathbb{R}\right)_\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathfrak{g} \times \bar{\mathfrak{g}}. $$ This result is used to determine the irreductible representations of the proper Lorentz group and thus the physical objects admissible when this symmetry is present. It is shown that finite representations of the proper Lorentz group are characterized by pairs of half-integers $(j_1,j_2)$, which determine unambiguously the physical object associated to the given representation. For example, the representation $(0,0)$ of dimension $1$ is called the scalar representation, it corresponds to the Higgs field, and $(\frac{1}{2},0) \oplus (0,\frac{1}{2})$ of dimension $4$ is called the Dirac spinor representation, it corresponds to matter particle called fermions. This means that the mathematical group structure determines the material content of the universe following this algebraic structure.</description>
