      <title>CANUCS: Constraining the MACS J0416.1-2403 Strong Lensing Model with JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec and NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters has become an essential tool in astrophysics, allowing us to directly probe the dark matter distribution and study magnified background sources. The precision and reliability of strong lensing models rely heavily on the number and quality of multiple images of background sources with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We use the JWST 's NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model is constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images from 111 background sources and includes systems with previously known MUSE redshift and systems for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is &gt;20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The derived strong lensing model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of 0.53''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. We furthermore demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST particularly NIRISS, for strong lensing studies. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII] {\lambda}3727, [OIII] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959, 5007, and H{\alpha} lines at 1&lt;z&lt;3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.</description>

      <title>A Generative Model for Realistic Galaxy Cluster X-ray Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray morphologies of clusters of galaxies display significant variations, reflecting their dynamical histories and the nonlinear dependence of X-ray emissivity on the density of the intracluster gas. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of X-ray morphology have long been considered a proxy for determining whether clusters are dynamically active or "relaxed." Conversely, the use of circularly or elliptically symmetric models for cluster emission can be complicated by the variety of complex features realized in nature, spanning scales from Mpc down to the resolution limit of current X-ray observatories. In this work, we use mock X-ray images from simulated clusters from THE THREE HUNDRED project to define a basis set of cluster image features. We take advantage of clusters' approximate self similarity to minimize the differences between images before encoding the remaining diversity through a distribution of high order polynomial coefficients. Principal component analysis then provides an orthogonal basis for this distribution, corresponding to natural perturbations from an average model. This representation allows novel, realistically complex X-ray cluster images to be easily generated, and we provide code to do so. The approach provides a simple way to generate training data for cluster image analysis algorithms, and could be straightforwardly adapted to generate clusters displaying specific types of features, or selected by physical characteristics available in the original simulations.</description>

      <title>Testing the parametric model for self-interacting dark matter using matched halos in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systemically evaluate the performance of the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halo model proposed in arXiv:2305.16176 with matched halos from high-resolution cosmological CDM and SIDM simulations. The model incorporates SIDM effects along mass evolution histories of CDM halos and it is applicable to both isolated halos and suhbhalos. We focus on the accuracy of the model in predicting halo density profiles at $z=0$ and the evolution of maximum circular velocity. We find the model predictions agree with the simulations within $10\%-50\%$ for most of the simulated (sub)halos, $50\%-100\%$ for extreme cases. This indicates that the model effectively captures the gravothermal evolution of the halos with very strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. For an example application, we apply the model to study the impact of various SIDM scenarios on strong lensing perturber systems, demonstrating its utility in predicting SIDM effects for small-scale structure analyses. Our findings confirm that the model is an effective tool for mapping CDM halos into their SIDM counterparts.</description>

      <title>A test for the redshift dependence of $\sigma_8$ using $f\sigma_8$ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for a redshift dependence of $\sigma_8^0$ using 23 growth rate measurements from redshift space distortions and peculiar velocity measurements as a consistency check of $\Lambda$CDM. For this purpose we use the dataset from arXiv:1806.10822 consisting of 22 measurements, which has been vetted for internal consistencies. Eighteen of these measurements have been obtained from the Gold-2017 sample, collated from multiple redshift space distortion surveys between 2009 and 2016, whereas the remaining four have been obtained from the eBOSS DR14 quasar survey. We also added one additional data point from the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample. We find that for this dataset the $\sigma_8^0$ values are consistent between the low redshift and high redshift samples using three different redshift cuts. This implies that the growth rate measurements are consistent with a constant $\sigma_8^0$ in accord with $\Lambda$CDM, assuming there are no uncontrolled systematics in this dataset.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the binary viewing angle bias for standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inconsistency between experiments in the measurements of the local Universe expansion rate, the Hubble constant, suggests unknown systematics in the existing experiments or new physics. Gravitational-wave standard sirens, a method to independently provide direct measurements of the Hubble constant, have the potential to address this tension. Before that, it is critical to ensure there is no substantial systematics in the standard siren method. A significant systematic has been identified when the viewing angle of the gravitational-wave sources, the compact binary coalescences, is inferred inaccurately from electromagnetic observations of the sources. Such systematic has led to more than 10% discrepancy in the standard siren Hubble constant measurements with the observations of binary neutron star merger, GW170817. In this Letter, we develop a new formalism to infer and mitigate this systematic. We demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty of the Hubble constant measurements can be reduced to smaller than their statistical uncertainty with 5, 10, and 20 binary neutron star merger observations. We show that our formalism successfully reduces the systematics even if the shape of the biased viewing angle distribution does not follow precisely the model we choose. Our formalism ensures unbiased standard siren Hubble constant measurements when the binary viewing angles are inferred from electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>The dependence of halo bias on the protohalo shape alignment with the initial tidal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical evidence supporting the primordial origin of secondary halo bias even on the galactic mass scale. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we investigate the dependence of halo bias on the degree of misalignment between the protohalo inertia and initial tidal tensors, $\tau$, measured at redshift, $z_{i}=127$. From the TNG 300-1 galactic halos in logarithmic mass range of $10.5&lt; m\equiv \log[M/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})]\le 13$ identified at $z=0,\ 0.5$ and $1$, a clear signal of $\tau$ bias is detected. For the case that $\tau$ is measured from the initial tidal field smoothed on the scale of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})\lesssim 1$, the halo $\tau$ bias is found to be very similar in its tendency and amplitude to the spin bias at all of the three redshifts, if the effects of backsplash halos are properly eliminated. For the case of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})=2$, the $\tau$ bias at $z=1$ turns out to behave like the age bias, diminishing rapidly in the range of $m&gt; 12$. At $z=0$ and $0.5$, however, the $\tau$ and age bias factors show large differences in their overall strengths, which is attributed to the dominant nonlinear effects that undermine the former but enhance the latter. Given these numerical results along with the previous finding that $\tau$ shares a large amount of mutual information with the formation epochs and spin parameters of galactic halos, it is concluded that the origins of halo age and spin bias must be closely linked with the primordial factor, $\tau$, and that the difference in the tendency between the two bias factors on the galactic mass scale reflects the multi-scale influence of $\tau$ on the halo secondary properties.</description>

      <title>Kaniadakis entropy in extreme gravitational and cosmological environments: a review on the state-of-the-art and future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaniadakis ($\kappa$-deformed) statistics is being widely used for describing relativistic systems with non-extensive behavior and/or interactions. It is built upon a one-parameter generalization of the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy, possessing the latter as a particular sub-case. Recently, Kaniadakis model has been adapted to accommodate the complexities of systems under the influence of gravity. The ensuing framework exhibits a rich phenomenology that allows for a deeper understanding of the most extreme conditions of the Universe. Here we present the state-of-the-art of $\kappa$-statistics, discussing its virtues and drawbacks at different energy scales. Special focus is dedicated to gravitational and cosmological implications, including effects on the expanding Universe in dark energy scenarios. This review highlights the versatility of Kaniadakis paradigm, demonstrating its broad application across various fields and setting the stage for further advancements in statistical modeling and theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation during cosmic phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may be part of the dark matter. It is shown here that PBHs form more easily during cosmic phase transitions. For approximately scale-invariant primordial curvature fluctuations the PBH mass function may therefore leave a record of the thermal history of the early Universe. In particular a peak is expected on the 1.9 solar mass scale due to the cosmic QCD transition.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the large-scale CMB anomalies: The impact of the SZ signal from the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full sky measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies by $\textit{WMAP}$ and $\textit{Planck}$ have highlighted the presence of several unexpected isotropy-breaking features on the largest angular scales.
  In this work, we investigate the impact of the local large-scale structure on these anomalies through the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects. We use a constrained hydrodynamical simulation that reproduces the local Universe in a box of $500\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc to construct full sky maps of the temperature anisotropies produced by these two CMB secondary effects and discuss their statistical properties on large angular scales. We show the significant role played by the Virgo cluster on these scales, and compare it to theoretical predictions and random patches of the universe obtained from the hydrodynamical simulation $\textit{Magneticum}$.
  We explore three of the main CMB large-scale anomalies -- i.e., lack of correlation, quadrupole-octopole alignment and hemispherical asymmetry -- , both in the latest $\textit{Planck}$ data (PR4), where they are detected at a similar level to the previous releases, and using the simulated secondaries from the local Universe, verifying their negligible impact.</description>

      <title>Multi-spectral sirens: Gravitational-wave cosmology with (multi-) sub-populations of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic expansion rate can be directly measured with gravitational waves (GWs) of the compact binary mergers, by jointly constraining the mass function of the population and the cosmological model via the so called spectral sirens. Such a method relies on the features in the mass functions, which may originate from some individual sub-populations, and hence become blurred/indistinct due to the superposition of different sub-populations. In this work we propose a novel approach to constrain the cosmic expansion rate with sub-populations of GW events, named multi-spectral sirens. We illustrate the advantage of the multi-spectral sirens compared to the traditional spectral sirens by simulation with mock data. The application of this approach to the GWTC-3 data yields $H_0=73.25^{+29.87}_{-25.55}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (median and symmetric 68.3\% credible level). The incorporation of the bright standard siren GW170817 with a uniform prior in $ [10,200] ~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ gives $H_0=72.38^{+15.03}_{-9.13}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (68.3\% confidence level), corresponding to an improvement of $\sim28\%$ with respect to the measurement from sole GW170817.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Exploring SN Ia properties in the vicinity of under-dense environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented statistics of detected Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) brought by the Zwicky Transient Facility enables us to probe the impact of the Large-Scale Structure on the properties of these objects. The goal of this paper is to explore the possible impact of the under-dense part of the large-scale structure on the intrinsic SALT2 light curve properties of SNe Ia and uncover possible biases in SN Ia analyses. With a volume-limited selection of ZTF-Cosmo-DR2 Type Ia supernovae overlapping with the SDSS-DR7 survey footprint, we investigate the distribution of their properties with regard to voids detected in the SDSS-DR7 galaxy sample. We further use Voronoi volumes as proxy for local density environments within the large-scale structure. We find a moderate dependency of the stretch toward the localisation around the void centre and none when considering colour. The local Voronoi volumes mostly affect the fraction of low/high stretch supernovae. With the current statistics available, we consider that the impact of high or low local density environment can be considered as a proxy for the colour of the host galaxy. Under-dense environments should not cause any biases in supernova analyses.</description>

      <title>A search for the fine-structure constant evolution from fast radio bursts and type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for a space-time variation of the fundamental constants has been explored over the years to test our physical theories. In this paper, we use the dispersion measure ($DM$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) combined with type Ia supernovae (SNe) data to investigate a possible redshift evolution of the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$), considering the runaway dilaton scenario, which predicts $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} = - \gamma\ln{(1+z)}$, where $\gamma$ is a constant proportional to the current value of the coupling between the dilaton field and hadronic matter. We derive all the relevant expressions for the $DM$ dependence concerning the fine-structure constant and constrain the parameter $\gamma$ from measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the constraining power of larger samples of FRB measurements for data sets with $N = 500$ and $N = 1000$ points. We found that the uncertainty on $\gamma$ can be improved by one order of magnitude and that limits on $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha}$ beyond $\sigma \sim 10^{-2}$ will depend crucially on better control of statistical and systematic uncertainties of upcoming FRB data.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Gravitational Waves from SU(2) Axion Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study detection prospects of a gravitational-wave background (GWB) sourced by SU(2) gauge fields considering all possible observational constraints. More precisely, we consider bounds set by cosmic microwave background measurements, primordial black hole overproduction, as well as backreaction of the gauge fields on the background evolution. Gravitational-waves data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration show no evidence for a GWB contribution from axion inflation. However, we are able to place conservative constraints on the parameters of the SU(2) inflation with current data. We investigate conditions on the inflationary potential that would lead to a detectable signal that evades astrophysical and cosmological constraints and discuss detection prospects for third generation networks.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Shifts in Deuterated Methanol Induced by Variation of me/mp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients, Q_mu, of microwave molecular transitions in the ground torsion-rotation state of deuterated methanol (CH3OD, CD3OH, and CD3OD) to small variations in the fundamental physical constant mu = me/mp - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - are reported. Theoretical motivation for changes in mu comes from a variety of models beyond the Standard Model of particle physics which are invoked to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy that dominate the Universe. The calculated values of Q_mu range from -300 to +73 and, thus, make deuterated methanol promising for searches for small space-time changes in mu. It is also shown that among the calculated sensitivity coefficients Q_mu using different Hamiltonians in the present and previous works, there are several pronounced outliers of unclear nature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present the European Low Frequency Survey (ELFS), a project that will enable foregrounds-free measurements of the primordial $B$-mode polarization and a detection of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, to a level $\sigma(r) = 0.001$ by measuring the Galactic and extra-galactic emissions in the 5--120\,GHz frequency window. Indeed, the main difficulty in measuring the B-mode polarization comes from the fact that many other processes in the Universe also emit polarized microwaves, which obscure the faint Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal. The first stage of this project is being carried out in synergy with the Simons Array (SA) collaboration, installing a 5.5--11\,GHz (X-band) coherent receiver at the focus of one of the three 3.5\,m SA telescopes in Atacama, Chile, followed by the installation of the QUIJOTE-MFI2 in the 10--20 GHz range. We designate this initial iteration of the ELFS program as ELFS-SA. The receivers are equipped with a fully digital back-end that will provide a frequency resolution of 1\,MHz across the band, allowing us to clean the scientific signal from unwanted radio frequency interference, particularly from low-Earth orbit satellite mega constellations. This paper reviews the scientific motivation for ELFS and its instrumental characteristics, and provides an update on the development of ELFS-SA.</description>

      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their spectral energy distributions can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes eight LRDs from the CEERS survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) at 0.53 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that the SEDs of all the LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with the best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 40% and 85%. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by $\sim 2$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scaling of precursor domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks have a large impact on cosmology and present interesting dynamics that can be controlled by various scaling regimes. In the first stage after spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry, the network is seeded with `DW precursors', the zeros of a tachyonic field. At sufficiently weak coupling, this stage can be quite long. The network is then driven to a non-relativistic scaling regime: in flat spacetime the correlation length grows like $L\sim t^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa=1/2$. We focus on the precursor regime in cosmology, assuming a power-law scale factor $a\propto t^\alpha$. We obtain the scaling exponent as a function of the external parameter, $\kappa(\alpha)$, by explicit computation in $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions, and find a smooth transition from nonrelativistic scaling with $\kappa\simeq 1/2$ for $\alpha\lesssim1/2$ to DW gas regime $\kappa \simeq \alpha$ for $\alpha\gtrsim1/2$, confirming previous arguments. The precise form of the transition $\kappa(\alpha)$ is surprisingly independent of dimension, suggesting that similar results should also be valid in $3+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bursty Star Formation in Dwarfs is Sensitive to Numerical Choices in Supernova Feedback Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the {\small SMUGGLE} stellar feedback model, we compute idealized simulations of a $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{10} \, \msun$ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of $\sim 3$. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the non-linear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.</description>

      <title>Smooth reheating and dark matter via non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how a dark sector can provide a crucial link between a vacuum-dominated early universe and the later radiation-dominated epoch. As an example, we consider a feeble axion-like coupling of dark non-Abelian gauge fields with a single inflaton. In this scenario, a dark heat bath emerges at the end of inflation. As the dark sector cools down, its gauge fields confine into composite glueball states. The reheating of the visible sector is realized through portal interactions. After confinement, discrete symmetries protect part of the glueball states that form relic dark matter, while the others keep decaying into Standard Model degrees of freedom. The dark relic abundance depends mostly on the departure from equilibrium dynamics after the phase transition, constraining the confinement scale of the dark sector. Moreover, indirect detection and Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set bounds on the scale of portal interactions. We show that in a narrow but non-vanishing region of the parameter space, the correct dark matter abundance and sufficient reheating temperature are simultaneously reached.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic non-singular quantum bounce as a seesaw and amplification mechanism for magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of a homogeneous magnetic field within Bianchi-I loop quantum cosmology, in which the big bang singularity is replaced with an anisotropic quantum bounce. Using effective spacetime description, we conduct extensive numerical simulations with randomized initial conditions for two cases: first in the presence of a pure homogeneous magnetic field and then adding a massless scalar field that effectively captures the bounce regime even in the presence of inflationary potentials. For a cigar-like approach to the classical big bang, which is far more prevalent than a point-like approach, the quantum geometric bounce acts as a seesaw mechanism for magnetic field energy density. Due to the seesaw mechanism, the magnetic field energy density gets amplified by several orders of magnitude across the bounce for a small pre-bounce value of magnetic field energy density, or vice versa. In the presence of the scalar field, the seesaw mechanism is completely replaced by amplification of the magnetic field across the bounce when the initial energy density of the scalar field significantly dominates. When the universe has a point-like approach to the classical big bang, the seesaw mechanism is absent, and magnetic field energy density experiences amplification or suppression across the non-singular bounce depending on initial densities.</description>

      <title>Evolution of perturbations in the model of Tsallis holographic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated evolution of metric and density perturbations for Tsallis model of holographic dark energy with energy density $\sim L^{2\gamma - 4}$, where $L$ is length of event horizon or inverse Hubble parameter and $\gamma$ is parameter of non-additivity close to $1$. Because holographic dark energy is not an ordinary cosmological fluid but a phenomena caused by boundaries of the universe, the ordinary analysis for perturbations is not suitable. One needs to consider perturbations of the future event horizon. For realistic values of parameters it was discovered that perturbations of dark energy don't grow infinitely but vanish or freeze. We also considered the case of realistic interaction between holographic dark energy and matter and showed that in this case perturbations also can asymptotically freeze with time.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Spectroscopy with Skipper CCDs: First Results from a Skipper CCD Focal Plane Prototype at SIFS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first on-sky results from an ultra-low-readout-noise Skipper CCD focal plane prototype for the SOAR Integral Field Spectrograph (SIFS). The Skipper CCD focal plane consists of four 6k x 1k, 15 $\mu$m pixel, fully-depleted, p-channel devices that have been thinned to ~250 $\mu$m, backside processed, and treated with an anti-reflective coating. These Skipper CCDs were configured for astronomical spectroscopy, i.e., single-sample readout noise &lt; 4.3 e- rms/pixel, the ability to achieve multi-sample readout noise $\ll$ 1 e- rms/pixel, full-well capacities ~40,000-65,000 e-, low dark current and charge transfer inefficiency (~2 x 10$^{-4}$ e-/pixel/s and 3.44 x 10$^{-7}$, respectively), and an absolute quantum efficiency of $\gtrsim$ 80% between 450 nm and 980 nm ($\gtrsim$ 90% between 600 nm and 900 nm). We optimized the readout sequence timing to achieve sub-electron noise (~0.5 e- rms/pixel) in a region of 2k x 4k pixels and photon-counting noise (~0.22 e- rms/pixel) in a region of 220 x 4k pixels, each with a readout time of $\lesssim$ 17 min. We observed two quasars (HB89 1159+123 and QSO J1621-0042) at redshift z ~ 3.5, two high-redshift galaxy clusters (CL J1001+0220 and SPT-CL J2040-4451), an emission line galaxy at z = 0.3239, a candidate member star of the Bo\"{o}tes II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, and five CALSPEC spectrophotometric standard stars (HD074000, HD60753, HD106252, HD101452, HD200654). We present charge-quantized, photon-counting observations of the quasar HB89 1159+123 and show the detector sensitivity increase for faint spectral features. We demonstrate signal-to-noise performance improvements for SIFS observations in the low-background, readout-noise-dominated regime. We outline scientific studies that will leverage the SIFS-Skipper CCD data and new detector architectures that utilize the Skipper floating gate amplifier with faster readout times.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

Abstract: The McVittie-Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard FLRW cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner-Sharp mass-energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the universe expands.</description>

      <title>On the use of far-infrared and sub-millimeter line ratios to constrain the physical properties of gas in high-z galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical emission line diagnostics, which are a common tool to constrain the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, become progressively inaccessible at higher redshifts for ground-based facilities. Far-infrared (FIR) emission lines, which are redshifted into atmospheric windows accessible by ground-based sub-millimeter facilities, could provide alternative ISM diagnostics to optical emission lines. We investigate FIR line ratios involving [CII]$\lambda 158 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 52 \mu$m, [NII]$\lambda 122 \mu$m and [NIII$\lambda 57 \mu$m, using synthetic emission lines applied to a high-resolution (m$_{\rm gas}$= 883.4 M$_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation, including radiative-transfer post processing with KramsesRT at z = 6.5. We find that the [CII]/[NII]122 ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density of photo-dissociation regions, and thus could be a useful tool to trace the properties of this gas phase in galaxies. We also find that [NII]/[NIII] is a good tracer of the temperature and [OIII]52/[OIII]88 a good tracer of the gas density of HII regions. Emission line ratios containing the [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m line are sensitive to high velocity outflowing gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion, we extend the determination of quasicircular orbital parameters to be used by subsequent full numerical simulations to the 3.5PN order, and find that this leads to lower eccentricities, $e$, than with our previous method that used up to 3PN order. We also supplement the computation of the radial infall due to radiation reaction and the location of the center of mass to 3.5PN order, providing explicit formulas. In addition, we consider the small mass ratio limit by explicitly including the Schwarzschild and Kerr limits, the later in quasi-isotropic as well as in our standard use of ADMTT coordinates. We evolve binaries with a $q=1/16$ mass ratio by using 3PN, 3.5PN, 3.5PN+Schwarzschild, 3.5PN+KerrQISO and 3.5PN+KerrADMTT quasicircular data for three different configurations where the larger hole intrinsic spins are $\chi^z=-0.8$, $-0.4$ and $+0.8$. Using different measures of eccentricity from the black hole trajectories and from the waveform amplitudes and phases, we determine a systematic reduction of eccentricities with respect to the 3PN initial values by factors of up to an order of magnitude, and reaching the desired $e\sim10^{-3}$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Single-epoch and Differential Astrometric Microlensing of Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and discuss a new experimental approach to measure the centroid shift induced by gravitational microlensing in the images of lensed quasars (astrometric microlensing). Our strategy is based on taking the photocenter of a region in the quasar large enough as to be insensitive to microlensing as reference to measure the centroid displacement of the continuum. In this way, single-epoch measurements of astrometric microlensing can be performed. Using numerical simulations, we show that, indeed, the centroid shift monotonically decreases as the size of the emitting region increases, and only for relatively large regions, like the broad line region (BLR), does the centroid shift become negligible. This opens interesting possibilities to study the stratification of the different emitters in the accretion disk and the BLR. We estimate the amplitude of the centroid shifts for 79 gravitationally lensed images and study more thoroughly the special cases Q2237+030 A, RXJ1131-1231 A, PG1115+080 A2 and SDSS J1004+4112 A. We propose to use spectro-astrometry to simultaneously obtain the photocenters of the continuum and of different emission line regions since, with the precision of forthcoming instruments, astrometric microlensing by $\sim 1 M_\odot$ mass microlenses may be detected in many quasar lensed images. When we consider more massive micro/millilenses, $M\gtrsim 10 M_\odot$, often proposed as the constituents of dark matter, the BLR becomes sensitive to microlensing and can no longer be used as a positional reference to measure centroid shifts. Differential microlensing between the images of a lensed quasar along several epochs should be used instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the search for a coherent and consistent formulation to describe quantum gravity corrections to Quantum Field Theory. We implement two fundamental ingredients discussed in previous analyses: on one hand, the construction of the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin and Born-Oppenheimer picture for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory of gravity and matter by using a reference fluid as physical clock; on the other hand, we explicitly separate in the metric field its own purely classical contribution from the quantum graviton degrees of freedom. This allows to derive, by the expansion in a Planckian parameter, a unitary theory properly evaluating the Quantum Field Theory modifications in the considered regime. More specifically, we recover at zero order the standard theory on curved space-time after averaging over the graviton sector. The physical corrections are induced at first order by (quantum) gravitons, thought as the slow-varying component of the system, as opposed to the fast quantum matter and reference fluid. The genuine contribution due to gravitons, non-factorizable into an independent phase, provides a coherent quantum gravity modification on Quantum Field Theory. We show this by determining the predicted inflationary spectrum during an exact de Sitter phase of the primordial Universe, finding a breaking of the scale invariant morphology even when the inflation potential is modelled by a cosmological constant term. Remarkably, the behavior of such non-scale-invariant spectrum overlaps predictions previously obtained in literature by neglecting non-unitary terms emerging in those formulations. In this respect, the present model provides a satisfactory regularization of such approaches, by virtue of a more realistic construction of the physical clock for the total (gravity + matter) quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in large-volume cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter: Impact of the non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ultra-light bosonic particle of mass around $10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ is of special interest as a dark matter candidate, as it both has particle physics motivations, and may give rise to notable differences in the structures on highly non-linear scales due to the manifestation of quantum-physical wave effects on macroscopic scales, which could address a number of contentious small-scale tensions in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using a spectral technique, we here discuss simulations of such fuzzy dark matter (FDM), including the full non-linear wave dynamics, with a comparatively large dynamic range and for larger box sizes than considered previously. While the impact of suppressed small-scale power in the initial conditions associated with FDM has been studied before, the characteristic FDM dynamics are often neglected; in our simulations, we instead show the impact of the full non-linear dynamics on physical observables. We focus on the evolution of the matter power spectrum, give first results for the FDM halo mass function directly based on full FDM simulations, and discuss the computational challenges associated with the FDM equations. FDM shows a pronounced suppression of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which can be understood as a damping effect due to 'quantum pressure'. In certain regimes, however, the FDM power can exceed that of CDM, which may be interpreted as a reflection of order-unity density fluctuations occurring in FDM. In the halo mass function, FDM shows a significant abundance reduction below a characteristic mass scale only. This could in principle alleviate the need to invoke very strong feedback processes in small galaxies to reconcile $\Lambda$CDM with the observed galaxy luminosity function, but detailed studies that also include baryons will be needed to ultimately judge the viability of FDM.</description>

      <title>Impact of Self-shielding Minihalos on the Ly$\alpha$ Forest at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense gas in minihalos with masses of $10^6-10^8~M_\odot$ can shield themselves from reionization for $\sim100$ Myr after being exposed to the UV background. These self-shielded systems, often unresolved in cosmological simulations, can introduce strong absorption in quasar spectra. This paper is the first systematic study on the impact of these systems on the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We first derive the HI column density profile of photoevaporating minihalos by conducting 1D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We utilize these results to estimate the Ly$\alpha$ opacity from minihalos in a large-scale simulation that cannot resolve self-shielding. When the ionization rate of the background radiation is $0.03\times10^{-12}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, as expected near the end of reionization at $z\sim5.5$, we find that the incidence rate of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers increases by a factor of $\sim2-4$ compared to at $z=4.5$. The Ly$\alpha$ flux is, on average, suppressed by $\sim 3\%$ of its mean due to minihalos. The absorption features enhance the 1D power spectrum up to $\sim5\%$ at $k\sim0.1~h~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~({\rm or}~10^{-3}~{\rm km}^{-1}~{\rm s})$, which is comparable to the enhancement caused by inhomogeneous reionization. The flux is particularly suppressed in the vicinity of large halos along the line-of-sight direction at separations of up to $10~h^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}$ at $r_\perp\lesssim2~h^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}$. However, these effects become much smaller for higher ionizing rates ($\gtrsim0.3\times10^{-12}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) expected in the post-reionization Universe. Our findings highlight the need to consider minihalo absorption when interpreting the Ly$\alpha$ forest at $z\gtrsim5.5$. Moreover, the sensitivity of these quantities to the ionizing background intensity can be exploited to constrain the intensity itself.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results I. Improved data selection and processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder is performing line intensity mapping of CO emission to trace the distribution of unresolved galaxies at redshift $z \sim 3$. We present an improved version of the COMAP data processing pipeline and apply this to the first two seasons of observations. This analysis improves on the COMAP Early Science (ES) results in several key aspects. On the observational side, all second season scans were made in constant-elevation mode, after noting that the previous Lissajous scans were associated with increased systematic errors; those scans accounted for 50% of the total Season 1 data volume. Secondly, all new observations were restricted to an elevation range of 35-65 degrees, to minimize sidelobe ground pickup. On the data processing side, more effective data cleaning in both the time- and map-domain has allowed us to eliminate all data-driven power spectrum-based cuts. This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. On the other hand, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduce a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these. Subtracting only 5 out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of 8 higher than in ES. The resulting maps have reached an uncertainty of $25$-$50\,\mu K$ per voxel, providing by far the strongest constraints on cosmological CO line emission published to date.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results II. Updated constraints on the CO(1-0) power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the cosmological 3D power spectrum of carbon monoxide CO(1-0) emission in the redshift range $2.4$-$3.4$. The constraints are derived from the two first seasons of Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder line-intensity mapping observations aiming to trace star-formation during the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly. These results improve on the previous Early Science (ES) results through both increased data volume and improved data processing methodology. On the methodological side, we now perform cross-correlations between groups of detectors (''feed-groups''), as opposed to cross-correlations between single feeds, and this new feed-group pseudo power spectrum (FGPXS) is constructed to be more robust against systematic effects. In terms of data volume, the effective mapping speed is significantly increased due to an improved observational strategy as well as better data selection methodology. The updated spherically- and field-averaged FGPXS, $\tilde{C}(k)$, is consistent with zero, at a probability-to-exceed of around $34\,\%$, with an excess of $2.7\,\sigma$ in the most sensitive bin. Our power spectrum estimate is about an order of magnitude more sensitive in our six deepest bins across ${0.09\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.73\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$, as compared to the feed-feed pseudo power spectrum (FPXS) of COMAP ES. Each of these bins individually constrains the CO power spectrum to ${kP_\mathrm{CO}(k)&lt; 2400-4900\,\mathrm{\mu K^2 Mpc^{2}}}$ at $95\,\%$ confidence. To monitor potential contamination from residual systematic effects, we analyze a set of 312 difference-map null tests and find that these are consistent with the instrumental noise prediction. In sum, these results provide the strongest direct constraints on the cosmological 3D CO(1-0) power spectrum published to date.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results III. Implications for cosmic molecular gas content at "Cosmic Half-past Eleven"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\langle{Tb}\rangle&lt;4.8$ $\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.</description>

      <title>Violation of C/CP Symmetry Induced by a Scalar Field Emerging from a Two-Brane Universe: A Gateway to Baryogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model of baryogenesis is introduced where our usual visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk. The visible matter and antimatter sectors are naturally coupled with the hidden matter and antimatter sectors, breaking the C/CP invariance and leading to baryogenesis occurring after the quark-gluon era. The issue of leptogenesis is also discussed. The symmetry breaking spontaneously occurs due to the presence of an extra scalar field supported by the $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ gauge group, which extends the conventional electromagnetic gauge field in the two-brane universe. Observational consequences are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an inflationary kinetic function with an integrable pole that is traversed during inflation. This scenario leads to enhanced spectra of primordial scalar inhomogeneities with detectable signals: formation of primordial black holes (that could explain Dark Matter) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (that could reproduce the recent Pulsar Timing Array observation, or predict signals in future detectors such as LISA or ET). Spectral signatures depend on whether the inflaton mass dimension at the pole is above or below 2. Values mildly below 2 allow a big power spectrum enhancement with a mild tuning. Finally, we discuss the possibility that a kinetic pole can arise as anomalous dimension of the inflaton due to quantum effects of Planckian particles that become light at some specific inflaton field value.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Axion Domain Wall Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion can solve the Strong CP Problem and be the dark matter of our universe. If the PQ symmetry breaking scale associated with the axion is below the inflationary reheating temperature, axion strings and domain walls populate the universe. Most of these strings and walls decay away into axion dark matter, but a small subset of the walls will be self-enclosed surfaces that are not attached to any strings. These enclosed walls can collapse in on themselves, compressing a large amount of energy into a small volume and potentially forming primordial black holes (PBHs). We study the number density and dynamics of these self-enclosed walls, taking into account their size distribution, Hubble expansion, asphericities, and all stages of domain wall dynamics using a combination of semi-analytic and numerical approaches. We find that axion models with a high axion decay constant $f_a$, such as those of interest in early matter-dominated cosmologies, yield a PBH abundance potentially observable by future gravitational lensing surveys. We note that the formalism developed here is also useful for predicting relic PBH abundances in other models that exhibit unstable domain walls.</description>

      <title>Constraining spherically symmetric metrics by the gap between photon rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of luminous matter that surrounds a black hole or some other sufficiently compact object produces an infinite sequence of images. Besides the direct (or primary) image, it comprises demagnified and deformed replicas of the original known as photon rings which are progressively nearing the boundary of the socalled shadow. In the present paper, we present analytical approximation formulas for higher-order photon rings for an asymptotically flat, static, spherically symmetric spacetime that admits a photon sphere. We consider a geometrically thin disk of light sources in the equatorial plane and an observer at arbitrary inclination far away from the center. Fixing the emission radius and leveraging the strong deflection limit, which provides an analytical logarithmic approximation for the deflection angle, we find the deformed shape of higher-order photon rings in the form of a polar equation on the observer's screen. It has been suggested by other authors to use the relative size of photon rings for characterizing the underlying spacetime. In particular, the relative separation between two neighboring photon rings, which we call "gap parameter", was considered. We analytically calculate the gap parameter of higher-order photon rings for metrics of the considered class that may depend on multiple parameters. The advantage of using this quantity is in the fact that, to within the assumed approximations, it is independent of the mass of the central object (or of some other characteristic parameter if the mass is zero) and of the distance of the observer. Measurements of the gap parameter, which may become possible in the near future, will restrict the spacetime models that are in agreement with the observations. Even without knowing the inner and outer radii of the shining disk, it will conclusively rule out some metrics. Some examples are provided.</description>

Abstract: The Primakoff process plays a crucial role in axion production in astrophysical environments and laboratories. Given the rising interest in axion physics and many on-going experimental activities, we conduct a comprehensive calculation of this process and carefully examine several aspects that have been neglected in the literature. In particular, our calculation is valid for axions with significantly large masses, which would be of importance to axion searches utilizing crystal and liquid xenon detectors. We present the most updated calculation of the Primakoff solar axion flux, with a simple parametrization that is applicable to a broad range of axion masses up to a few tens of keV. Our code is publicly available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a cyclic Universe: resilience through cycles and vacuum state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalised calculation for the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations in a cyclic Universe, making no assumptions about the vacuum state of the theory and accounting for the contribution of tensor modes produced in the dark energy phase of the previous cycle. We show that these modes have minimal impact on the spectrum observed in the current cycle, except for corrections on scales as large as the comoving Hubble radius today. These corrections are due to sub-horizon modes produced towards the end of the dark energy phase, persisting into the ekpyrotic phase of the next cycle as additional quanta. In relation to the vacuum state, we argue that non-Bunch-Davies quanta can easily overwhelm the energy density driving the dark energy phase, potentially compromising the model. Therefore, avoiding backreaction effects sets restrictive constraints on deviations away from the Bunch-Davies vacuum during this phase, limiting the overall freedom to consider alternative vacua in the cyclic Universe.</description>

Abstract: We present an improved calculation of the light element abundances in the framework of Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$. We compare the methods of our calculation to previous literature including the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The PDG result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $-0.014 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.026$, for deuterium we find the constraint $-0.005 \leq \delta v / v \leq -0.001$. These bounds are more stringent than what was found earlier.</description>

Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: We present a new Hubble parameterization method and employ observational data from Hubble, Pantheon, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to constrain model parameters. The proposed method is thoroughly validated against these datasets, demonstrating a robust fit to the observational data. The obtained best-fit values are $H_0 = 67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$ $\text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm{m0}} = 0.2764\pm{0.0094}$, and $\alpha = 0.33\pm{0.22}$, consistent with the Planck 2018 results, highlighting the existence of Hubble tension.</description>
