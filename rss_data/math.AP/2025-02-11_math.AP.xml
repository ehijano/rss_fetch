      <title>On rigidity of the steady Ericksen-Leslie system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions, with scaling-invariant bounds, to the steady simplified Ericksen-Leslie system in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \{0\}$. When $n=2$, we construct and classify a class of self-similar solutions. When $n\ge 3$, we establish the rigidity asserting that if $(u,d)$ satisfies a scaling-invariant bound with a small constant, then $u\equiv 0$ and $d=$ constant for $n\geq 4$ or $u$ is a Landau solution and $d=$ constant for $n=3$. Such a smallness condition can be weaken when $n=4$ or the solutions are self-similar.</description>

      <title>The non-conservative compressible two-fluid system with common pressure: Global existence and sharp time asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the global-in-time evolution of a generic compressible two-fluid model in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq3$) with the common pressure law. Due to the non-dissipative properties for densities and two different particle paths caused by velocities, the system lacks the usual symmetry structure and is partially dissipative in the sense that the Shizuta-Kawashima condition is violated, which makes it challenging to study its large-time stability. By developing a pure energy method in the framework of Besov spaces, we succeed in constructing a unique global classical solution to the Cauchy problem when the initial data are close to their constant equilibria. Compared to the previous related works, the main novelty lies in that our method is independent of the spectral analysis and does not rely on the $L^1$ smallness of the initial data. Furthermore, if additionally the initial perturbation is bounded in $\dot{B}^{\sigma_0}_{2,\infty}$ type spaces with lower regularity, the optimal time convergence rates are also obtained. In particular, the asymptotic convergence of the non-dissipative components toward their equilibrium states is first characterized.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear eigenvalue problems for a class of quasilinear operator on complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the nonlinear eigenvalue problem on complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below, to find the unknowns $\lambda$ and $u$, such that
  $$
  Qu + \lambda f(u) = 0
  $$
  where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $u$, with respect to the quasilinear operator $Qu = \operatorname{div} (\mathcal{F}(u^2, |\nabla u|^2)\nabla u)$ and nonlinar function $f(\cdot)\neq 0$. We generalize the Cheng--Yau gradient estimate in \cite{shen2025feasibilitynashmoseriterationchengyautype} and demonstrate that under certain conditions, a non-zero eigenvalue gives rise to unbounded eigenfunction $u$. Our new result also covers more quasilinear equations like $p$-porous medium equation (\textit{i.e.} $\Delta_p u^q = \lambda u^r$), and generally, $\Delta_{p}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_iu^{q_i}\right)+\lambda u^r = 0$.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical Rayleigh-Taylor instability of non-homogeneous fluid in annular region with Naiver-slip boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness and Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability for a system of two-dimensional nonhomogeneous incompressible fluid, subject to the non-slip and Naiver-slip boundary conditions at the outer and inner boundaries, respectively, in an annular region. In order to effectively utilize the domain shape, we analyze this system in polar coordinates. First, for the well-posedness to this system, based on the spectral properties of Stokes operator, Sobolev embedding inequalities and Stokes' estimate in the context of the specified boundary conditions, etc, we obtain the local existence of weak and strong solutions using semi-Galerkin method and prior estimates. Second, for the density profile with the property that it is increasing along radial radius in certain region, we demonstrate that it is linear instability (R-T instability) through Fourier series and the settlement of a family of modified variational problems. Furthermore, based on the existence of the linear solutions exhibiting exponential growth over time, we confirm the nonlinear instability of this steady state in both Lipschitz and Hadamard senses by nonlinear energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Micromagnetics: Compactness Criteria, Existence of Minimizers, and Brown's Fundamental Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and qualitative properties of minimizers for a class of nonlocal micromagnetic energy functionals defined on bounded domains. The considered energy functional consists of a symmetric exchange interaction, which penalizes spatial variations in magnetization, and a magnetostatic self-energy term that accounts for long-range dipolar interactions. Motivated by the extension of Brown's fundamental theorem on fine ferromagnetic particles to nonlocal settings, we develop a rigorous variational framework in $L^2(\Omega;\mathbb{S}^2)$ under mild assumptions on the interaction kernel \( j \), including symmetry, L\'evy-type integrability, and prescribed singular behavior. For spherical domains, we generalize Browns fundamental results by identifying critical radii $R^*$ and $R^{**}$ that delineate distinct energetic regimes: for \( R \leq R^* \), the uniform magnetization state is energetically preferable (\emph{small-body regime}), whereas for $R \geq R^{**}$, non-uniform magnetization configurations become dominant (\emph{large-body regime}). These transitions are analyzed through Poincar\'e-type inequalities and explicit energy comparisons between uniform and vortex-like magnetization states.
  Our results directly connect classical micromagnetic theory and contemporary nonlocal models, providing new insights into domain structure formation in nanoscale magnetism. Furthermore, the mathematical framework developed in this work contributes to advancing theoretical foundations for applications in spintronics and data storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Relationship among solutions for three-phase change problems with Robin, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the melting process of a three-phase Stefan problem in a semi-infinite material, imposing a convective boundary condition at the fixed face. By employing a similarity-type transformation, the problem is reduced to a solvable form, yielding a unique explicit solution. The analysis uncovers significant equivalences among the solutions of three different three-phase Stefan problems: one with a Robin boundary condition, another with a Dirichlet boundary condition, and a third one with a Neumann boundary condition at the fixed face. These equivalences are established under the condition that the problem data satisfy a specific relationship, providing new insights into the behaviour of phase change problems under varying boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply our idea, which previously we used in the analysis of the pure power NLS, consisting in spitting the virial inequality method into a large energy inequality combined with Kato smoothing, to the case of generalized Korteweg--De Vries pure power equations. We assume that a solution remains for all positive times very close to a soliton and then we prove an asymptotic stability result for $t\to +\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We prove limiting absorption resolvent bounds for the semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator with a repulsive potential in dimension $n\ge 3$, which may have a singularity at the origin. As an application, we obtain time decay for the weighted energy of the solution to the associated wave equation with a short range repulsive potential and compactly supported initial data.</description>

      <title>Global classical solutions to the ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system near Maxwellians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a plasma, the ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system models the evolution of ions interacting with themselves through the self-consistent electrostatic potential and collisions. It distinguishes the electric Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system via an extra exponential nonlinearity in the coupled Poisson-Poincar\'{e} equation which creates some essential mathematical difficulties. Despite its physical importance, the global well-posedness to this system remains completely open. This gap is filled in this article in the three dimensional period box case. We show that any smooth, small initial perturbation of a global Maxwellian satisfying the conservations of mass, momentum and energy leads to a unique global-in-time classical solution with an exponential decay for the whole range of collision potential $r\in (-3,1]$. The construction relies on the nonlinear energy method, new nonlinear elliptic regularity estimates and coercivity inequality of the linearized collision operator $\mathcal{L}$ novelly deduced for the ion model.</description>

      <title>Acoustic nonlinearity parameter tomography with the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation in frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to combine the advantages of the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson JMGT equation as an advanced model in nonlinear acoustics with a frequency domain formulation of the forward and inverse problem of acoustic nonlinearity parameter tomography, enabling the multiplication of information by nonlinearity. Our main result is local uniqueness of the space dependent nonlinearity parameter from boundary measurements, which we achieve by linearized uniqueness with an Implicit Function type perturbation argument in appropriately chosen topologies. Moreover, we shortly dwell on the application of a regularized Newton type method for reconstructing the nonlinearity coefficient, whose convergence can be established by means of the linear uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear fast diffusion equation on smooth metric measure spaces: Hamilton-Souplet-Zhang estimates and a Ricci-Perelman super flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents new gradient estimates for positive solutions to the nonlinear fast diffusion equation on smooth metric measure spaces, involving the $f$-Laplacian. The gradient estimates of interest are mainly of Hamilton-Souplet-Zhang or elliptic type and are proved using different set of methods and techniques. Various implications notably to parabolic Liouville type results and characterisation of ancient solutions are given. The problem is considered in the general setting where the metric and potential evolve under a super flow involving the Bakry-\'Emery $m$-Ricci curvature tensor. The remarkable interplay between geometry, nonlinearity, and evolution -- and their intricate roles in the estimates and the maximum exponent range of fast diffusion -- is at the core of the investigation.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of Nonlocal Diffusion Systems on Time-Varying Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of nonlocal diffusion systems on time-varying domains, and fully characterize their asymptotic dynamics in the asymptotically fixed, time-periodic and unbounded cases. The kernel is not necessarily symmetric or compactly supported, provoking anisotropic diffusion or convective effects. Due to the nonlocal diffusion on time-varying domains in our systems, some significant challenges arise, such as the lack of regularizing effects of the semigroup generated by the nonlocal operator, as well as the time-dependent inherent coupling structure in kernel. By investigating a general nonautonomous nonlocal diffusion system in the space of bounded and measurable functions, we establish a comprehensive and unified framework to rigorously examine the threshold dynamics of the original system on asymptotically fixed and time-periodic domains. In the case of an asymptotically unbounded domain, we introduce a key auxiliary function to separate vanishing coefficients from nonlocal diffusions. This enables us to construct appropriate sub-solutions and derive the global threshold dynamics via the comparison principle. The findings may be of independent interest and the developed techniques, which do not rely on the existence of the principal eigenvalue, are expected to find further applications in the related nonlocal diffusion problems. We also conduct numerical simulations based on a practical model to illustrate our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Slow Patterns in Multilayer Dislocation Evolution with Dynamic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the slow patterns of multilayer dislocation dynamics modeled by a multiscale parabolic equation in the half-plane coupled with a dynamic boundary condition on the interface. We focus on the influence of bulk dynamics with various relaxation time scales, on the slow motion pattern on the interface governed by an ODE system. Starting from a superposition of N stationary transition layers, at a specific time scale for the interface dynamics, we prove that the dynamic solution approaches the superposition of N explicit transition profiles whose centers solve the ODE system with a repulsive force. Notably, this ODE system is identical to the one obtained in the slow motion patterns of the one-dimensional fractional Allen-Cahn equation, where the elastic bulk is assumed to be static. Due to the fully coupled bulk and interface dynamics, new corrector functions with delicate estimates are constructed to stabilize the bulk dynamics and characterize the limiting behavior of the dynamic solution throughout the entire half-plane.</description>

      <title>Monotone operator methods for a class of nonlocal multi-phase variable exponent problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of nonlocal multi-phase variable exponent problems within the framework of a newly introduced Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev space. We consider two problems, each distinguished by the type of nonlinearity it includes. To establish the existence of at least one nontrivial solution for each problem, we employ two different monotone operator methods.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Transonic Shock Solutions for Two-Dimensional Steady Compressible Euler Flows in an Expanding Nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are trying to show the uniqueness of transonic shock solutions in an expanding nozzle under certain conditions and assumptions on the boundary data and the shock solution. The idea is to compare two transonic shock solutions and show that they should coincide if the perturbation of the nozzle is sufficiently small. To this end, a condition on the pressure of the flow across the shock front is proposed, such that a priori estimates for the subsonic flow behind the shock front could be established without the assumption that it is a small perturbation of the unperturbed uniform subsonic state. With the help of these estimates, the uniqueness of the position of the intersection point between the shock front and the nozzle boundary could be further established by demonstrating the monotonicity of the solvability condition for the elliptic sub-problem of the subsonic flow behind the shock front. Then, via contraction arguments, two transonic shock solutions could be verified to coincide as the perturbation is small, which leads to the uniqueness of the transonic shock solution.</description>

      <title>Scattering for defocusing cubic NLS under locally damped strong trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the scattering problem for the cubic 3D nonlinear defocusing Schr\"odinger equation with variable coefficients. Previous scattering results for such problems address only the cases with constant coefficients or assume strong variants of the non-trapping condition, stating that all the trajectories of the Hamiltonian flow associated with the operator are escaping to infinity. In contrast, we consider the most general setting, where strong trapping, such as stable closed geodesics, may occur, but we introduce a compactly supported damping term localized in the trapping region, to explore how damping can mitigate the effects of trapping.
  In addition to the challenges posed by the trapped trajectories, notably the loss of smoothing and of scale-invariant Strichartz estimates, difficulties arise from the damping itself, particularly since the energy is not, a priori, bounded. For $H^{1+\epsilon}$ initial data -- chosen because the local-in-time theory is a priori no better than for 3D unbounded manifolds, where local well-posedness of strong $H^1$ solutions is unavailable -- we establish global existence and scattering in $H^{\frac 12}$ in positive times, the loss of regularity in scattering being related to the loss of smoothing due to trapping.</description>

      <title>Strong ill-posedness and non-existence in Sobolev spaces for generalized-SQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general surface quasi-geostrophic equation is the scalar transport equation defined by \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t}+v^\gamma_1 \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x_1}+v^\gamma_2 \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x_2} =0 ,
  \end{equation*} where the velocity comes defined by
  \begin{equation*}
  v^\gamma=\nabla^{\perp} \psi_\gamma=\left(\partial_{2} \psi_\gamma,-\partial_{1} \psi_\gamma \right), \quad \psi_\gamma=-\Lambda^{-1+\gamma} \theta,
  \end{equation*} and $\theta(\cdot,0)=\theta_0(\cdot)$ is the initial condition. We consider the parameter $\gamma \in (-1,1)$ and the non-local operator $\Lambda^{\alpha}=(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is defined on the Fourier side by $\widehat{\Lambda^{\alpha} f}(\xi)=|\xi|^{\alpha} \widehat{f}(\xi)$.
  The PDE is well-posed in the Sobolev spaces $H^s$ with $s&gt;2+\gamma$.
  In this paper we prove strong ill-posedness in the super-critical regime $H^\beta$ with $\beta\in [1,2+\gamma)\cap(\frac{3}{2}+\gamma,2+\gamma)$. To do this, we will derive an approximated PDE solvable by some family of functions that we will call pseudosolutions and that will allow us to control the norms of the real solutions.
  Using this result and a gluing argument we also prove non-existence of solutions in the same Sobolev spaces. Since the pseudosolution will control the real one, we can build a solution that will be initially in $H^{\beta}$ and will leave it instantaneously. Nevertheless, this solution exists for a long time and remains the only classical solution in a high regularity class.</description>

      <title>Refined blow-up behavior for reaction-diffusion equations with non scale invariant exponential nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider positive radial decreasing blow-up solutions of the semilinear heat equation \begin{equation*}
  u_t-\Delta u=f(u):=e^{u}L(e^{u}),\quad x\in \Omega,\ t&gt;0,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Omega=\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\Omega=B_R$ and $L$ is a slowly varying function
  (which includes for instance logarithms and their powers and iterates, as well as some strongly oscillating unbounded functions).
  We characterize the aymptotic blow-up behavior and obtain the sharp, global blow-up profile in the scale of the original variables $(x, t)$. Namely,
  assuming for instance $u_t\ge 0$, we have \begin{equation*}
  u(x,t)=G^{-1}\bigg(T-t+\frac{1}{8}\frac{|x|^2}{|\log |x||}\bigg)+o(1)\ \ \hbox{as $(x,t)\to (0,T)$,\quad where }
  G(X)=\int_{X}^{\infty} \frac{ds}{f(s)}ds.
  \end{equation*}
  This estimate in particular provides the sharp final space profile and the refined space-time profile. For exponentially growing nonlinearities, such results were up to now available only in the scale invariant case $f(u)=e^u$. Moreover, this displays a universal structure of the global blow-up profile, given by the resolvent $G^{-1}$ of the ODE composed with a fixed time-space building block, which is robust with respect to the factor $L(e^u)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the steady Stokes equations supplemented with Navier boundary conditions including a non-negative friction coefficient. We prove maximal regularity estimates (including the prominent spaces $W^{1,p}$ and $W^{2,p}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ for the velocity field) in bounded domains of minimal regularity. Interestingly, exactly one derivative more is required for the local boundary charts compared to the case of no-slip boundary conditions. We demonstrate the sharpness of our results by a propos examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a result on the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to nonlinear Partial Differential-Algebraic Equations (PDAEs). By applying established theoretical results, we identify the conditions that guarantee the existence of a unique local solution. The analysis relies on techniques from functional analysis, semi-group theory, and the theory of differential-algebraic systems. Additionally, we provide applications to illustrate the effectiveness of this result.</description>

      <title>Initial boundary value problems for time-fractional evolution equations in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an initial value problem for time-fractional evolution equation in Banach space $X$: $$ \pppa (u(t)-a) = Au(t) + F(t), \quad 0&lt;t&lt;T. \eqno{(*)} $$ Here $u: (0,T) \rrrr X$ is an $X$-valued function defined in $(0,T)$, and $a \in X$ is an initial value. The operator $A$ satisfies a decay condition of resolvent which is common as a generator of analytic semigroup, and in particular, we can treat a case $X=L^p(\OOO)$ over a bounded domain $\OOO$ and a uniform elliptic operator $A$ within our framework.
  First we construct a solution operator $(a, F) \rrrr u$ by means of $X$-valued Laplace transform, and we establish the well-posedness of (*) in classes such as weak solution and strong solutions. We discuss also mild solutions local in time for semilinear time-fractional evolution equations. Finally we apply the result on the well-posedness to an inverse problem of determining an initial value and we establish the uniqueness for the inverse problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proceed with the study of the Nehari manifold method for functionals in $C^1(X \setminus \{0\})$, where $X$ is a Banach space. We deal now with functionals whose fibering maps have two critical points (a minimiser followed by a maximiser). Under some additional conditions we show that the Nehari manifold method provides us with the ground state level and two sequences of critical values for these functionals. These results are applied to the class of {\it prescribed energy problems} as well as to the concave-convex problem for the {\it affine} $p$-Laplacian operator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical and numerical framework for studying evanescent waves in subwavelength band gap materials. By establishing a link between the complex Brillouin zone and various Hermitian and non-Hermitian phenomena, including defect localisation in band gap materials and the non-Hermitian skin effect, we provide a unified perspective on these systems. In two-dimensional structures, we develop analytical techniques and numerical methods to study singularities of the complex band structure. This way, we demonstrate that gap functions effectively predict the decay rates of defect states. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the Floquet transform with respect to complex quasimomenta. Based on this, we show that evanescent waves may undergo a phase transition, where local oscillations drastically depend on the location of corresponding frequency inside the band gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the momentum, the density, and the electromagnetic field associated with the massive KleinGordon-Maxwell equations converge in the semi-classical limit towards their respective equivalents associated with the relativistic Euler-Maxwell equations. The proof relies on a modulated stress-energy method and a compactness argument. We also give a proof of the well-posedness of the relativistic Euler-Maxwell equations and show how this system, and so the semi-classical limit of Klein-Gordon-Maxwell, is related to the relativistic massive Vlasov-Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Artifacts in Multistatic &amp; Passive Radar Imaging Using Microlocal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the analysis of many synthetic aperture radar (SAR) experiments the possibility of passive background signals being recorded simultaneously and corrupting the image is often overlooked. Our work addresses this by considering the multistatic experiment where two stationary emitters are "always on" so there is "crosstalk" between their signals. The model for the radar data is given by a Fourier integral operator, and we assume that the data cannot be separated into contributions from individual emitters. Using techniques of microlocal analysis, we show that "crosstalk" between emitters leads to artifacts in the image and we determine their locations relative to the scatterers that produced the data.
  To combat the harmful effects of crosstalk, we develop methods that allow us to create an image of a region of interest (ROI) that is free from such artifacts. The first method makes use of a carefully designed data acquisition geometry to localise artifacts away from a ROI, and the second is an image processing technique that displaces artifacts away from a ROI. These methods are verified via numerical implementation in MATLAB. The analysis carried out here is valuable in bistatic and multistatic radar experiments, where an unwanted, passive source is also being detected, as well as in passive imaging, where one wishes to produce a high-quality image purely from uncontrolled sources of illumination.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy for lattice systems of continuous spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinite lattice system of interacting spins living on a smooth compact manifold, with short- but not necessarily finite-range pairwise interactions. We construct the gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy on the space of translation-invariant spin measures, using an adaptation of the variational approach in Wasserstein space pioneered by Jordan, Kinderlehrer, and Otto. We also construct the infinite-volume diffusion corresponding to the so-called overdamped Langevin dynamics of the spins under the effect of the interactions and of thermal agitation.
  We show that the trajectories of the gradient flow and of the law of the spins under this diffusion both satisfy, in a weak sense, the same hierarchy of coupled parabolic PDE's, which we interpret as an infinite-volume Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation. We prove regularity of weak solutions and derive an Evolution Variational Inequality for regular solutions, which implies uniqueness. Thus, in particular, the trajectories of the gradient flow coincide with those obtained from the Langevin dynamics.
  Concerning the long-time evolution, we check that the free energy is always non-increasing along the flow and that moreover, if the Ricci curvature of the spin space is uniformly positive, then at high enough temperature the dynamics converges exponentially, in free energy and in specific Wasserstein distance, to the unique minimizer of the infinite-volume free energy.</description>

      <title>Sharp energy regularity and typicality results for H\"older solutions of incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to show a couple of typicality results for weak solutions $v\in C^\theta$ of the Euler equations, in the case $\theta&lt;1/3$. It is known that convex integration schemes produce wild weak solutions that exhibit anomalous dissipation of the kinetic energy $e_v$. We show that those solutions are typical in the Baire category sense. From [8], it is know that the kinetic energy $e_v$ of $\theta$-H\"older continuous weak solution $v$ of the Euler equations satisfy $ e_v\in C^{\frac{2\theta}{1-\theta}}$. As a first result we prove that solutions with that behavior are a residual set in suitable complete metric space $X_\theta$, that is contained in the space of all $C^\theta$ weak solutions, whose choice is discussed at the end of the paper. More precisely we show that the set of solutions $v\in X_\theta$ with $e_v \in C^{\frac{2\theta}{1-\theta}}$ but not to $\bigcup_{p\ge 1,\varepsilon&gt;0}W^{\frac{2\theta}{1-\theta} + \varepsilon,p}(I)$ for any open $I \subset [0,T]$, are a residual set in $X_\theta$. This, in particular, partially solves [9, Conjecture 1]. We also show that smooth solutions form a nowhere dense set in the space of all the $C^\theta$ weak solutions. The technique is the same and what really distinguishes the two cases is that in the latter there is no need to introduce a different complete metric space with respect to the natural one.</description>

      <title>A $p$-specific spectral multiplier theorem with sharp regularity bound for Grushin operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work, P. Chen and E. M. Ouhabaz proved a $p$-specific $L^p$-spectral multiplier theorem for the Grushin operator acting on $\mathbb{R}^{d_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ which is given by \[ L =-\sum_{j=1}^{d_1} \partial_{x_j}^2 - \bigg( \sum_{j=1}^{d_1} |x_j|^2\bigg) \sum_{k=1}^{d_2}\partial_{y_k}^2. \] Their approach yields an $L^p$-spectral multiplier theorem within the range $1&lt; p\le \min\{ \frac{2d_1}{d_1+2},\frac{2(d_2+1)}{d_2+3} \}$ under a regularity condition on the multiplier which is sharp only when $d_1\ge d_2$. In this paper, we improve on this result by proving $L^p$-boundedness under the expected sharp regularity condition $s&gt;(d_1+d_2)(1/p-1/2)$. Our approach avoids the usage of weighted restriction type estimates which played a key role in the work of P. Chen and E. M. Ouhabaz, and is rather based on a careful analysis of the underlying sub-Riemannian geometry and restriction type estimates where the multiplier is truncated along the spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We prove an $L^p$-spectral multiplier theorem for sub-Laplacians on Heisenberg type groups under the sharp regularity condition $s&gt;d\left|1/p-1/2\right|$, where $d$ is the topological dimension of the underlying group. Our approach relies on restriction type estimates where the multiplier is additionally truncated along the spectrum of the Laplacian on the center of the group.</description>

Abstract: The present article focuses on a unique continuation result for certain weighted ray transforms, utilizing the unique continuation property (UCP) of the fractional Laplace operator. Specifically, we demonstrate a conservative property for momentum ray transforms acting on tensors, as well as the antilocality property for both weighted ray and cone transforms acting on functions.</description>

      <title>Insensitizing controls for a quasi-linear parabolic equation with diffusion depending on gradient of the state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a quasi-linear parabolic equation with a diffusion term dependent on the gradient to the state with Dirichlet boundary conditions is considered. The goal of this paper is to prove the existence of control that insensitizes the system under study which is the case that Xu Liu left open in 2012. It is well known that the insensitizing control problem is equivalent to a null controllability result for a cascade system, which is obtained by duality arguments, Carleman estimates, and the Right Inverse mapping theorem. Also, some possible extensions and open problems concerning other quasi-linear systems are presented.</description>

      <title>Global solutions versus finite time blow-up for the supercritical fast diffusion equation with inhomogeneous source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solutions in self-similar form, either global in time or presenting finite time blow-up, to the supercritical fast diffusion equation with spatially inhomogeneous source $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty) $$ with $$ m_c=\frac{(N-2)_+}{N}\leq m&lt;1, \quad \sigma\in(\max\{-2,-N\},\infty), \quad p&gt;\max\left\{1+\frac{\sigma(1-m)}{2},1\right\} $$ are considered. It is proved that global self-similar solutions with the specific tail behavior $$ u(x,t)\sim C(m)|x|^{-2/(1-m)}, \qquad {\rm as} \ |x|\to\infty $$ exist exactly for $p\in(p_F(\sigma),p_s(\sigma))$, where $$ p_F(\sigma)=m+\frac{\sigma+2}{N}, \qquad p_s(\sigma)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{m(N+2\sigma+2)}{N-2}, &amp; N\geq3,\\\infty, &amp; N\in\{1,2\}, \end{array}\right. $$ are the renowned Fujita and Sobolev critical exponents. In contrast, it is shown that self-similar solutions presenting finite time blow-up exist for any $\sigma\in(-2,0)$ and $p$ as above, but do not exist for any $\sigma\geq0$ and $p\in(p_F(\sigma),p_s(\sigma))$. We stress that all these results are \emph{new also in the homogeneous case $\sigma=0$}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of weak collisions on Landau damping in the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck system on a torus, specifically focusing on its proximity to a Maxwellian distribution. In the case where the Gevrey index satisfies $\frac{1}{s}\leq3$, we establish the global stability and enhanced dissipation of small initial data, which remain unaffected by the small diffusion coefficient $\nu$. For Gevrey index $\frac{1}{s}&gt;3$, we prove the global stability and enhanced dissipation of initial data, whose size is on the order of $O(\nu^\frac{1-3s}{3-3s})$. Our analysis provides insights into the effects of phase mixing, enhanced dissipation, and plasma echoes.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Phase Transition Problems with Evolving Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mathematical analysis and homogenization of a moving boundary problem posed for a highly heterogeneous, periodically perforated domain. More specifically, we are looking at a one-phase thermo-elasticity system with phase transformations where small inclusions, initially periodically distributed, are growing or shrinking based on a kinetic under-cooling-type law and where surface stresses are created based on the curvature of the phase interface. This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but $\varespilon$-independent time interval ($\varespilon$ is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we discover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct byproduct of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective precomputing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.</description>

Abstract: We derive new singular value decompositions and range characterizations for the X-ray transform on the Poincar\'e disk, intertwining relations with distinguished differential operators of wedge type, and a surjectivity result for the backprojection operator. New functional settings are found, which allow to sharply understand boundary behavior issues and invertibility settings. The approach mainly exploits analogous results obtained only recently in the Euclidean disk, together with the projective equivalence between the two models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non radiative solutions of the energy critical non linear wave equation are global solutions $u$ that furthermore have vanishing asymptotic energy outside the lightcone at both $t \to \pm \infty$:\[ \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \| \nabla_{t,x} u(t) \|_{L^2(|x| \ge |t|+R)} = 0, \]for some $R \&amp;gt; 0$. They were shown to play an important role in the analysis of long time dynamics of solutions, in particular regarding the soliton resolution: we refer to the seminal works of Duyckaerts, Kenig and Merle, see \cite{DKM:23} and the references therein.We show that the set of non radiative solutions which are small in the energy space is a manifold whose tangent space at $0$ is given by non radiative solutions to the linear equation (described in \cite{CL24}). We also construct nonlinear solutions with an arbitrary prescribed radiation field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a 1-parameter family (A{\lambda}, {\Phi}{\lambda}){\lambda} of multi-phase high frequency solutions to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations in Lorenz gauge in the (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This family is based on an initial ansatz. We prove that for {\lambda} small enough the family of solutions exists on an interval uniform in {\lambda} only function of the initial ansatz. These solutions are close to an approximate solution constructed by geometric optics. The initial ansatz needs to be regular enough, to satisfy a polarization condition and to satisfy the constraints for Maxwell null-transport in Lorenz gauge, but there is no need for smallness of any kind. The phases need to interact in a coherent way. We also observe that the limit (A0, {\Phi}0) is not solution to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations but to a Klein-Gordon-Maxwell null-transport type system.</description>

Abstract: We show the convergence of the solutions to the massive nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation toward solutions to a relativistic Euler with potential type system in the semi-classical limit. In particular, the momentum and the density of Klein-Gordon converge to the the momentum and the density of the relativistic Euler system in Lebesgue norms. The relativistic Euler with potential is equivalent to the usual relativistic Euler with pressure up to a rescaling. The proof relies on the modulated energy method adapted to the wave equation and the relativistic setting: a modulated stress-energy method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish conditions to ensure the existence of minimizer for a class of mass-constrained functionals involving a nonattractive point interaction in three dimensions. The existence of minimizers follows from the compactness of minimizing sequences which holds when we can simultaneously rule out the possibilities of vanishing and dichotomy. The proposed method is derived from the strategy used to avoid vanishing in Adami, Boni, Carlone &amp; Tentarelli (Calc. Var. 61, 195 (2022)) and the strategy used to avoid dichotomy in Bellazzini &amp; Siciliano (J. Funct. Anal. 261, 9 (2011)). As applications, we prove the existence of ground states with sufficiently small mass for the following nonlinear problems with a point interaction: a Kirchhoff-type equation and the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonlinear periodic Westervelt equation with excitations located within a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \in \{2,3\}$, subject to Robin boundary conditions. This problem is of particular interest for advancing imaging techniques %in invasive ultrasound, such as intravascular ultrasound imaging. that exploit nonlinearity of the acoustic propagation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in both the linear and the nonlinear setting, thereby allowing for spatially varying coefficients as relevant in quantitative imaging. %, highlighting the crucial role of small excitations in ensuring existence and uniqueness in the nonlinear setting. Derivation of a multiharmonic formulation enables us to show the generation of higher harmonics (that is, responses at multiples of the fundamental frequency) due nonlinear wave propagation. An iterative scheme for solving the resulting system is proposed that relies on successive resolution of these higher harmonics, and its convergence under smallness conditions on the excitation is proven. Furthermore, we investigate the numerical solution of the resulting system of Helmholtz equations, employing a conforming finite element method for its discretization. Through an implementation of the proposed methodology, we illustrate how acoustic waves propagate in nonlinear media. This study aims to enhance our understanding of ultrasound propagation dynamics, which is essential for obtaining high-quality images from limited in vivo and boundary measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an optimal distributed control problem for a reaction-diffusion-based SIR epidemic model with human behavioral effects. We develop a model wherein non-pharmaceutical intervention methods are implemented, but a portion of the population does not comply with them, and this noncompliance affects the spread of the disease. Drawing from social contagion theory, our model allows for the spread of noncompliance parallel to the spread of the disease. The quantities of interest for control are the reduction in infection rate among the compliant population, the rate of spread of noncompliance, and the rate at which non-compliant individuals become compliant after, e.g., receiving more or better information about the underlying disease. We prove the existence of global-in-time solutions for fixed controls and study the regularity properties of the resulting control-to-state map. The existence of optimal control is then established in an abstract framework for a fairly general class of objective functions. Necessary first--order optimality conditions are obtained via a Lagrangian based stationarity system. We conclude with a discussion regarding minimization of the size of infected and non-compliant populations and present simulations with various parameters values to demonstrate the behavior of the model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fractional Orlicz boundary Hardy-type inequality for bounded Lipschitz domains. Further, we establish fractional Orlicz boundary Hardy-type inequalities with logarithmic corrections for specific critical cases across various domains, such as bounded Lipschitz domains, domains above the graph of a Lipschitz function, and the complement of a bounded Lipschitz domain.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Poroelasticity with Thermal Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes and explores a linear hydrodynamic thermo-elasticity system within mixture models, comprising fluid and solid phases, with a focus on biological tissues, particularly tumor-related phenomena. Although tumor growth is not yet incorporated, this work aims to comprehend the interaction between thermal effects and hydrodynamics on short-time scales where the tumor size typically remains stable. We establish the existence of a unique weak solution within the framework of implicit evolution equations, overcoming challenges posed by intricate coupling mechanisms within the system. To further investigate the model, we then study the one-dimensional model and explore in detail the complex interplay between fluid flow, solid deformation, and heat transfer. This complex coupled system of equations is reduced for the short time scale to obtain the semi-analytical solution.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and linearization for a semilinear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the initial value problem for a defocusing semi-linear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity. By employing Moser-Trudinger type inequalities and Strichartz estimates, we establish global well-posedness in the energy space for radially symmetric initial data. Additionally, we derive the linearization of energy-bounded solutions. The main challenge in our analysis arises from the spatial growth of the nonlinearity at infinity, which prevents the direct application of Sobolev embeddings or Hardy inequalities to control the potential energy. The main novelty in this work lies in overcoming this challenge within the radial framework through the combined application of the Strauss inequality and Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Coupled Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Min-Max and Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for two-player infinite-dimensional games with cooperative or competitive structure. These games take the form of coupled partial differential equations in which players optimize over a space of measures, driven by either a gradient descent or gradient descent-ascent in Wasserstein-2 space. We characterize the properties of the Nash equilibrium of the system, and relate it to the steady state of the dynamics. In the min-max setting, we show, under sufficient convexity conditions, that solutions converge exponentially fast and with explicit rate to the unique Nash equilibrium. Similar results are obtained for the cooperative setting. We apply this framework to distribution shift induced by interactions among a strategic population of agents and an algorithm, proving additional convergence results in the timescale-separated setting. We illustrate the performance of our model on (i) real data from an economics study on Colombia census data, (ii) feature modification in loan applications, and (iii) performative prediction. The numerical experiments demonstrate the importance of distribution-level, rather than moment-level, modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the power-law vortex $\overline{\omega}(x) = \beta |x|^{-\alpha}$, which explicitly solves the stationary unforced incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in both physical and self-similar coordinates, is exponentially linearly stable in self-similar coordinates with the natural scaling. This answers a question from the monograph by Albritton et al. on Vishik's non-uniqueness work on the two-dimensional Euler equations. Moreover, we prove that in physical coordinates, the linearization around $\overline{\omega}$ generates a strongly continuous group of isometries and we prove that the spectrum of the linearization is contained in the imaginary axis. Our results are valid for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ functions with a mild symmetry condition.</description>

Abstract: We consider energy-minimizing harmonic maps into trees and we prove the regularity of the singular part of the free interface near triple junction points. Precisely, by proving a new epiperimetric inequality, we show that around any point of frequency $3/2$, the free interface is composed of three $C^{1,\alpha}$-smooth $(d-1)$-dimensional manifolds (composed of points of frequency $1$) with common $C^{1,\alpha}$-regular boundary (made of points of frequency $3/2$) that meet along this boundary at 120 degree angles. Our results also apply to spectral optimal partition problems for the Dirichlet eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Spectral multipliers on M\'etivier groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an $L^p$-spectral multiplier theorem under the sharp regularity condition $s &gt; d\left|1/p - 1/2\right|$ for sub-Laplacians on M\'etivier groups. The proof is based on a restriction type estimate which, at first sight, seems to be suboptimal for proving sharp spectral multiplier results, but turns out to be surprisingly effective. This is achieved by exploiting the structural property that for any M\'etivier group the first layer of any stratification of its Lie algebra is typically much larger than the second layer, a phenomenon closely related to Radon-Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Critical Equations Involving Nonlocal Subelliptic Operators on Stratified Lie Groups: Spectrum, Bifurcation and Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the bifurcation phenomena and establish the existence of multiple solutions for the nonlocal subelliptic Brezis-Nirenberg problem:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} (-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}})^s u= |u|^{2_s^*-2}u+\lambda u \quad &amp;\text{in}\quad \Omega, \\ u=0\quad &amp; \text{in}\quad \mathbb{G}\backslash \Omega, \end{cases}
  \end{equation*} where $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}})^s$ is the fractional sub-Laplacian on the stratified Lie group $\mathbb{G}$ with homogeneous dimension $Q,$ $\Omega$ is a open bounded subset of $\mathbb{G},$ $s \in (0,1)$, $Q&gt; 2s,$ $2_s^*:=\frac{2Q}{Q-2s}$ is subelliptic fractional Sobolev critical exponent, $\lambda&gt;0$ is a real parameter. This work extends the seminal contributions of Cerami, Fortunato, and Struwe to nonlocal subelliptic operators on stratified Lie groups. A key component of our study involves analyzing the subelliptic $(s, p)$-eigenvalue problem for the (nonlinear) fractional $p$-sub-Laplacian $(-\Delta_{p,{\mathbb{G}}})^s$ \begin{align*}
  (-\Delta_{p,{\mathbb{G}}})^s u&amp;=\lambda |u|^{p-2}u,~\text{in}~\Omega,\nonumber
  u&amp;=0~\text{ in }~{\mathbb{G}}\setminus\Omega, \end{align*} with $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $Q&gt;ps$, over the fractional Folland-Stein-Sobolev spaces on stratified Lie groups applying variational methods. Particularly, we prove that the $(s, p)$-spectrum of $(-\Delta_{p,{\mathbb{G}}})^s$ is closed and the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(\Omega)$ with $\lambda_2(\Omega)&gt;\lambda_1(\Omega)$ is well-defined and provides a variational characterization of $\lambda_2(\Omega)$. We emphasize that the results obtained here are also novel for $\mathbb{G}$ being the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of the 3-D compressible Navier-Stokes equations for monatomic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the blow-up of the $3$-D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the adiabatic exponent $\gamma=5/3$, which corresponds to the law of monatomic gases. This is the degenerate case in the sense of [Merle, Rapha\"el, Rodnianski and Szeftel, Ann. of Math. (2), 196 (2022), 567-778; Ann. of Math. (2), 196 (2022), 779-889]. Motivated by these breakthrough works, we first establish the existence of a sequence of smooth, self-similar imploding solutions to the compressible Euler equations for $\gamma=5/3$. Subsequently, we utilize these self-similar profiles to construct smooth, asymptotically self-similar blow-up solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for monatomic gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a sub-Laplacian on a two-step stratified Lie group $G$ of topological dimension $d$. We prove new $L^p$-spectral multiplier estimates under the sharp regularity condition $s&gt;d\left|1/p-1/2\right|$ in settings where the group structure of $G$ is degenerate, extending previously known results for the non-degenerate case. Our results include variants of the free two-step nilpotent group on three generators and Heisenberg-Reiter groups. The proof combines restriction type estimates with a detailed analysis of the sub-Riemannian geometry of $G$. A key novelty of our approach is the use of a refined spectral decomposition into caps on the unit sphere in the center of the Lie group.</description>

Abstract: We collect a number of elementary constructions of $\Z_2$ harmonic $1$-forms, and of families of these objects. These examples show that the branching set $\Sigma$ of a $\Z_2$ harmonic 1-form may exhibit the following features: i) $\Sigma$ may be a non-trivial link; ii) $\Sigma$ may be a multiple cover; iii) $\Sigma$ may be immersed, and appear as a limit of smoothly embedded branching loci; iv) there are families of $\Z_2$ harmonic $1$-forms whose branching sets $\Sigma$ have tangent cones filling out a positive dimensional space, even modulo isometries. We show that Features i) and ii) occur already in dimension three, while the remaining ones appear at least in dimension four and higher.</description>

Abstract: Kato's well known distributional inequality for the magnetic Laplacian holds equally in the more general setting of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED), where the wave function is vector-valued and the vector potential is quantized. We give two new applications of this result: First, we show that eigenstates satisfy a subsolution estimate. Second, for general states, with energy distribution strictly below the ionization threshold, we give a short proof of pointwise exponential decay in the electronic configuration.</description>

Abstract: We use the differential algebra of polytopes to explain the known remarkable relation of the combinatorics of the associahedra and permutohedra with the universal compositional and multiplicative inversion formulas for the formal power series. This approach allows to single out the associahedra and permutohedra among all graph-associahedra and emphasizes the significance of the differential equations for special sequences of simple polytopes derived earlier by one of the authors. We discuss also the link with the geometry of Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces $\bar M_{0,n}$ and the interpretation of the combinatorics of cyclohedra in relation with the classical Fa\`a di Bruno's formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many situations, the combined effect of advection and diffusion greatly increases the rate of convergence to equilibrium -- a phenomenon known as enhanced dissipation. Here we study the situation where the advecting velocity field generates a random dynamical system satisfying certain Harris conditions. If $\kappa$ denotes the strength of the diffusion, then we show that with probability at least $1 - o(\kappa^N)$ enhanced dissipation occurs on time scales of order $|\ln \kappa|$, a bound which is known to be optimal. Moreover, on long time scales, we show that the rate of convergence to equilibrium is almost surely independent of diffusivity. As a consequence we obtain enhanced dissipation for the randomly shifted alternating shears introduced by Pierrehumbert '94.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability of systems governed by conformable fractional order derivatives. It first establishes the existence and uniqueness of evolution operators for non-autonomous fractional-order homogeneous systems, using a suitable initial time defined as the intersection of two specific time intervals. Using the theory of linear evolution operators, Schauder's fixed-point theorem, and the Banach contraction principle, the study derives a new set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to non-autonomous conformable fractional semi-linear systems. Additionally, the paper examines the exact null controllability of abstract systems based on the mild solution. We provide a comprehensive example to demonstrate the applicability of the established theoretical results.</description>
