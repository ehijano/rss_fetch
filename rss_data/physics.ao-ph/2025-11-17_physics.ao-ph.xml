      <title>Stability of SQG Kolmogorov Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability analysis is performed on surface quasigeostrophic systems subjected to a Kolmogorov-type "shear force" on the boundaries using linear and nonlinear approaches. For a SQG system of semi-infinite depth forced on the upper boundary, the most linearly unstable mode is 2.74 the energy injection length scale. This is contrary to two-dimensional fluid systems, where the linear instability is greatest for long waves. In the presence of damping, the most linearly unstable mode shifts toward shorter length scales. The nonlinear critical Reynolds number across different damping strengths is found to be qualitatively similar to that of Euler 2D systems. For an SQG system of finite thickness being forced on both boundaries, its behaviour approaches that of a semi-infinite SQG system at the large thickness limit. In the small thickness limit, the behaviour of a symmetrically forced fluid layer approaches that of a 2D system, while an antisymmetrically forced fluid layer is not susceptible to both linear and nonlinear instabilities. With ageostrophic effects, an SQG+ system of semi-infinite depth is much more prone to instabilities than an otherwise identical SQG system in the absence of damping due to the instability of long-wave modes. However, damping significantly suppresses such instabilities. With increasing damping, the most linearly unstable mode moves toward a smaller length scale. Contrary to the zero damping case, when the damping is sufficiently large, ageostrophic effects have a small but measurable stabilising effect.</description>

      <title>Power Ensemble Aggregation for Improved Extreme Event AI Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>

      <title>Advanced Torrential Loss Function for Precipitation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold, rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the operational model.</description>
