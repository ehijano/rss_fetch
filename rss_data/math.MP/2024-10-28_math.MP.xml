      <title>Interrelations between dualities in classical integrable systems and classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the Ruijsenaars' action-angle duality in classical many-body integrable systems through the spectral duality transformation relating the classical spin chains and Gaudin models. For this purpose, the Lax matrices of many-body systems are represented in the multi-pole (Gaudin-like) form by introducing a fictitious spectral parameter. This form of Lax matrices is also interpreted as classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality.</description>

      <title>Mittag-Leffler Probability Density for Nonextensive Statistics and Superstatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a Mittag-Leffler density has interesting properties. The Mittag-Leffler random variable has a structural representation in terms of a positive Levy variable and the power of a gamma variable where these two variables are independently distributed. It is shown that several central limit-type properties hold but the limiting forms are positive Levy variable rather than a Gaussian variable. A path is constructed from a Mittag-Leffler function to the Mathai pathway model which also provides paths to nonextensive statistics and superstatistics.</description>

      <title>A mathematical theory of topological invariants of quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Hall conductance and its non-abelian and higher-dimensional analogs are obstructions to promoting a symmetry of a state to a gauge symmetry. To do this, we define a local Lie algebra over a Grothendieck site as a pre-cosheaf of Lie algebras with additional properties and propose that a gauge symmetry should be described by such an object. We show that infinitesimal symmetries of a gapped state of a quantum spin system form a local Lie algebra over a site of semilinear sets and use it to construct topological invariants of the state. Our construction applies to lattice systems on arbitrary asymptotically conical subsets of a Euclidean space including those which cannot be studied using field theory.</description>

      <title>Coherent States of Graphene Layer with and without a PT-symmetric Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct different classes of coherent and bicoherent states for the graphene tight-binding model in presence of a magnetic field, and for a deformed version where we include a $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric chemical potential $V$. In particular, the problems caused by the absence of a suitable ground state for the system is taken into account in the construction of these states, for $V=0$ and for $V\neq0$. We introduce ladder operators which work well in our context, and we show, in particular, that there exists a choice of these operators which produce a factorization of the Hamiltonian. The role of broken and unbroken $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry is discussed, in connection with the strength of $V$.</description>

      <title>Bilayer one-dimensional Convection-Diffusion-Reaction-Source problem. Analytical and numerical solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a theoretical analysis of a one-dimensional heat transfer problem in two layers involving diffusion, advection, internal heat generation or loss linearly dependent on temperature in each layer, and heat generation due to external sources. Additionally, the thermal resistance at the interface between the materials is considered. The situation of interest is modeled mathematically, explicit analytical solutions are found using Fourier techniques, and a convergent finite difference scheme is formulated to simulate specific cases. The solution is consistent with previous results. A numerical example is included that shows coherence between the obtained results and the physics of the problem. The conclusions drawn in this work expand the theoretical understanding of two-layer heat transfer and may also contribute to improving the thermal design of multilayer engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Tomography of Photonic Qubits with Realistic Coherent Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for characterizing quantum states. However, practical implementations of QST are significantly challenged by factors such as shot noise, attenuation, and Raman scattering, especially when photonic qubits are transmitted through optical fibers alongside classical signals. In this paper, we present a numerical framework to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of QST under these realistic conditions. The results reveal how the efficiency of QST is influenced by the power of the classical signal. By analyzing the fidelity of reconstructed states, we provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements for QST in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically an Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape seen from its trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A basic question about the directed landscape is how much of it can be reconstructed simply by knowing the shapes of its geodesics. We prove that the directed landscape can be reconstructed from the shapes of its semi-infinite geodesics. In order to show this result, we make use of the Busemann process of the directed landscape together with a novel ``coordinate system" and ``differential distance" to capture the behaviour of semi-infinite geodesics.</description>

      <title>The Free Energy of the Elastic Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of three papers about the Elastic Manifold model. This classical model proposes a rich picture due to the competition between the inherent disorder and the smoothing effect of elasticity. In this paper, we prove a Parisi formula, i.e. we compute the asymptotic quenched free energy and show it is given by the solution to a certain variational problem.
  This work comes after a long and distinguished line of work in the Physics literature, going back to the 1980's (including the foundational work by Daniel Fisher [29], Marc Mezard and Giorgio Parisi [50, 51], and more recently by Yan Fyodorov and Pierre Le Doussal [34, 35]. Even though the mathematical study of Spin Glasses has seen deep progress in the recent years, after the celebrated work by Michel Talagrand [67, 68], the Elastic Manifold model has been studied from a mathematical perspective, only recently and at zero temperature. The annealed topological complexity has been computed, by the first author with Paul Bourgade and Benjamin McKenna [15, 16]. Here we begin the study of this model at positive temperature by computing the quenched free energy.
  We obtain our Parisi formula by first applying Laplace's method to reduce the question to a related new family of spherical Spin Glass models with an elastic interaction. The upper bound is then obtained through an interpolation argument initially developed by Francisco Guerra [42] for the study of Spin Glasses. The lower bound follows by adapting the cavity method along the lines explored by Wei-Kuo Chen [23] and the multi-species synchronization method of Dmitry Panchenko [55]. In our next papers [19, 20] we will analyze the consequences of this Parisi formula.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the effects of quantum deformation in the undeformed Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model, the time dependence in the coupling parameter allows changes in the forms of the Rabi oscillations. In the inverse problem approach (IPA), the time-dependent coupling parameter is obtained from the resulting population inversion. In this work, we employ the IPA to obtain a time-dependent coupling that reproduces the effects of $\kappa$-deformation in an undeformed JC. This is relevant because it may pave the way for interpreting quantum deformation in the $\kappa$-JC and possibly enables an experimental verification in a setting where the coupling can be precisely controlled. We also propose a generalized IPA, which includes the cavity with a distribution of photons.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface $\mathcal{F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new kind of measures, called projection families, which generalize the classical notion of vector and operator-valued measures. The maximal class of reasonable functions admits an integral with respect to a projection family, where the integral is defined as an element of the second dual instead of the original space. We show that projection families possess strong enough properties to satisfy the theorems of Monotone Convergence and Dominated convergence, but are much easier to come by than the more restrictive operator-valued measures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Smith analysis of resonance perturbations in low $Q$ non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbing resonant systems causes shifts in their associated scattering poles in the complex plane. In a previous study [arXiv: 2408.11360], we demonstrated that these shifts can be calculated numerically by analyzing the residue of a generalized Wigner-Smith operator associated with the perturbation parameter. In this work, we extend this approach by connecting the Wigner-Smith formalism with results from standard electromagnetic perturbation theory applicable to open systems with resonances of arbitrary quality factors. We further demonstrate the utility of the method through several numerical examples, including the inverse design of a multi-layered nanoresonator sensor and an analysis of the enhanced sensitivity of scattering zeros to perturbations.</description>

      <title>A collocation heat polynomials method for one-dimensional inverse Stefan problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse one-phase Stefan problem in one dimension, aimed at identifying the unknown time-dependent heat flux P(t) with a known moving boundary position s(t), is investigated. A previous study [16] attempted to reconstruct the unknown heat flux P(t) using the Variational Heat Polynomials Method (VHPM). In this paper, we develop the Collocation Heat Polynomials Method (CHPM) for the reconstruction of the time-dependent heat flux P(t). This method constructs an approximate solution as a linear combination of heat polynomials, which satisfies the heat equation, with the coefficients determined using the collocation method. To address the resulting ill-posed problem, Tikhonov regularization is applied. As an application, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on benchmark problems. Numerical results show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs the time-dependent heat flux P(t), even in the presence of significant noise. The results are also compared with those obtained in [16] using the VHPM.</description>

Abstract: Temporally evolving systems are typically modeled by dynamic equations. A key challenge in accurate modeling is understanding the causal relationships between subsystems, as well as identifying the presence and influence of unobserved hidden drivers on the observed dynamics. This paper presents a unified method capable of identifying fundamental causal relationships between pairs of systems, whether deterministic or stochastic. Notably, the method also uncovers hidden common causes beyond the observed variables. By analyzing the degrees of freedom in the system, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of both causal influence and hidden confounders. This unified framework is validated through theoretical models and simulations, demonstrating its robustness and potential for broader application.</description>

      <title>Proof of bulk-edge correspondence for band topology by Toeplitz algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously yet concisely prove the bulk-edge correspondence for general $d$-dimensional ($d$D) topological insulators in complex Altland-Zirnbauer classes, which states that the bulk topological number equals to the edge-mode index. Specifically, an essential formula is discovered that links the quantity expressed by Toeplitz algebra, i.e., hopping terms on the lattice with an edge, to the Fourier series on the bulk Brillouin zone. We then apply it to chiral models and utilize exterior differential calculations, instead of the sophisticated \emph{K}-theory, to show that the winding number of bulk system equals to the Fredholm index of 1D edge Hamiltonian, or to the sum of edge winding numbers for higher odd dimensions. Moreover, this result is inherited to the even-dimensional Chern insulators as each of them can be mapped to an odd-dimensional chiral model. It is revealed that the Chern number of bulk system is identical to the spectral flow of 2D edge Hamiltonian, or to the negative sum of edge Chern numbers for higher even dimensions. Our methods and conclusions are friendly to physicists and could be easily extended to other physical scenarios.</description>

      <title>The product structure of MPS-under-permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods have proved to be highly effective in addressing a wide variety of physical scenarios, including those lacking an intrinsic one-dimensional geometry. In such contexts, it is possible for the problem to exhibit a weak form of permutational symmetry, in the sense that entanglement behaves similarly across any arbitrary bipartition. In this paper, we show that translationally-invariant (TI) matrix product states (MPS) with this property are trivial, meaning that they are either product states or superpositions of a few of them. The results also apply to non-TI generic MPS, as well as further relevant examples of MPS including the W state and the Dicke states in an approximate sense. Our findings motivate the usage of ans\"atze simpler than tensor networks in systems whose structure is invariant under permutations.</description>

      <title>Backreacted Coulomb energy in the Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Skyrme model is extended with the Maxwell action and a source term for the gauge field. We consider the specialized case of vanishing isospin states, such that only an electric potential is turned on and study the backreaction onto the Skyrme fields. In particular, we study Skyrmions with baryon numbers B=4,8,12,16 and 40. We find, in agreement with physical expectations, that the Coulomb backreaction is most pronounced for large Skyrmions and find furthermore that the dynamics of the theory is more sensitive to the backreaction than the ground states (global minimizers of the energy). Calibrating the model to Carbon-12, we find excellent agreement of the masses of the studied Skyrmions - within 1.86% of experimental data. The Coulomb energies are slightly larger than phenomenological fits suggest, but only by about 3-22%, whereas the radii are within 15% errors, with the largest errors on the smallest baryon number (B=4) and the smallest error on the large baryon numbers.</description>

      <title>Sylvester-Preconditioned Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Advection-Diffusion Equations with Inhomogeneous Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the adaptive-rank integration of general time-dependent advection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with spatially variable coefficients. We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta schemes for temporal discretization. The fully discretized scheme can be written as a generalized Sylvester equation, which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: (i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective Averaged-Coefficient Sylvester (ACS) preconditioner to invert the reduced system for the coefficient matrix efficiently, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. The proposed approach features a computational complexity of O(Nr2 + r3), where r represents the rank during the Krylov iteration and N is the resolution in one dimension, commensurate with the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J. Comput. Phys., 518 (2024)]. We present numerical examples that illustrate the computational efficacy and complexity of our algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study free boundary compressible viscous models that may include nonlinear viscosities. These are compressible/incompressible Navier-Stokes type systems for a non-Newtonian stress tensor. They describe the motion of a possibly non-Newtonian fluid in free flow and in congested regions. In the congested regions it appears the pressure that is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the incompressibility constraint, while in free flows it is a pressureless gas system. We establish the existence of generalized dissipative solutions in the case of in/out-flow boundary conditions and we also prove that if these solutions are smooth then they are classical solutions.</description>

      <title>On the properties of the density matrix of the $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-invariant model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15439v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an ansatz of generalizing the construction of recursion relations for the correlation functions of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant fundamental exchange model in the thermodynamic limit by Jimbo, Miwa, Smirnov, Takeyama and one of our present authors in 2004 for higher rank. Due to the structure of the correlators as functions of their inhomogeneity parameters, a recursion formula for the reduced density matrix was proven. In the case of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$, we use the explicit results of Kl\"umper and Ribeiro, and Nirov, Hutsalyuk and one of our present authors for the reduced density matrix of up to operator length three to verify whether it is possible to relate the residues of the density matrix of length $n$ to the density matrix of length smaller than $n$ as in $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. This is unclear, since the reduced quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation splits into two parts for higher rank. In fact, we show two relations, one of which is a straightforward generalisation to the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ case and one which is completely new. This allows us to construct an analogue of the operator $X_k$ which we call Snail Operator. In the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-case, this operator has many nice properties including in particular the fact that only one irreducible representation of the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, the Kirillov--Reshetikhin module $W_k$, contributed the residue at $\lambda_i-\lambda_j=-(k+1)$. Here, we give an overview of the mathematical background, T-systems, and show a new application of the extended T-systems introduced by Mukhin and Young in 2012 regarding the Snail Operator.</description>

Abstract: This work is a review with proofs of a group of results on the stochastic Burgers equation with small viscosity, obtained during the last two decades. These results jointly show that the equation makes a surprisingly good model of hydrodynamical turbulence. The model provides natural and rigorously justified analogies of a number of key predictions of the theory of turbulence, including the main assertions of the Kolmogorov approach to turbulence, known as the K41 theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14205v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the mean field Ising model from a geometric perspective, focusing on the thermodynamic limit. When the number of spins is finite, the Gibbs equilibria form a smooth Legendrian submanifold in the thermodynamic phase space whose points describe the stable macroscopic states of the system. We describe the convergence of these smooth Legendrian submanifolds, as the number of spins goes to infinity, to a singular Legendrian submanifold, admitting an analytic continuation that contains both the stable and metastable states. We also discuss the relaxation to a Gibbs equilibrium when the physical parameters are changed abruptly. The relaxation is defined via the gradient flow of the free energy with respect to the Wasserstein metric on microscopic states, that is, in the geometric language, via the gradient flow of the generating function of the equilibrium Legendrian with respect to the ghost variables. This leads to a discrete Fokker-Planck equation when the number of spins is finite. We show that in the thermodynamic limit this description is closely related to the seminal model of relaxation proposed by Glauber. Finally, we find a special range of parameters where such relaxation happens instantaneously, along the Reeb chords connecting the initial and the terminal Legendrian submanifolds.</description>

Abstract: Phase reduction is an important tool for studying coupled and driven oscillators. The question of how to generalize phase reduction to stochastic oscillators remains actively debated. In this work, we propose a method to derive a self-contained stochastic phase equation of the form $\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} \phi = a(\phi)\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} t + \sqrt{2D(\phi)}\,\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} W(t)$ that is valid not only for noise-perturbed limit cycles, but also for noise-induced oscillations. We show that our reduction captures the asymptotic statistics of qualitatively different stochastic oscillators, and use it to infer their phase-response properties.</description>

      <title>The Pauli-Villars regularised free energy of Dirac's vacuum in purely magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac vacuum is a non-linear polarisable medium rather than an empty space. This non-linear behaviour starts to be significant for extremely large electromagnetic fields such as the magnetic field on the surface of certain neutron stars. Even though the null temperature case was deeply studied in the past decades, the problem at non-zero temperature needs to be better understood. In this work, we present the first rigorous derivation of the one-loop effective magnetic Lagrangian at positive temperature, a non-linear functional describing the free energy of the Dirac vacuum in a classical magnetic field. After introducing our model, we properly define the free energy functional using the Pauli-Villars regularisation technique in order to remove the worst ultraviolet divergences, which represent a well known issue of the theory. The study of the properties of this functional is addressed before focusing on the limit of slowly varying classical magnetic fields. In this regime, we prove the convergence of this functional to the Euler-Heisenberg formula with thermal corrections, recovering the effective Lagrangian first derived by Dittrich in 1979.</description>

Abstract: New bivariate Griffiths polynomials of $q$-Racah type are introduced and characterized. They generalize the polynomials orthogonal on the multinomial distribution introduced by R. Griffiths fifty years ago. They also correspond to a $q$-deformation of the Griffiths polynomials of Racah type introduced previously by the authors and collaborators. The latter are recovered from the former by a $q\to1$ limit. We show that these new polynomials are bispectral and biorthogonal. We also exhibit some symmetry relations that are essential in the proof of the bispectrality property.</description>

Abstract: We provide a unified framework of Mahler measure, dessins d'enfants, and gauge theory. With certain physically motivated Newton polynomials from reflexive polygons, the Mahler measure and the dessin are in one-to-one correspondence. From the Mahler measure, one can construct a Hauptmodul for a congruence subgroup of the modular group, which contains the subgroup associated to the dessin. We also discuss their connections to the quantum periods of del Pezzo surfaces, as well as certain elliptic pencils. In brane tilings and quiver gauge theories, the modular Mahler flow might shed light on the inequivalence amongst the three different complex structures $\tau_{R,G,B}$. We also study how, in F-theory, 7-branes and their monodromies arise in the context of dessins.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of non-chiral topological phases in 2D fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, fermionic topological phases of quantum matter has attracted a lot of attention. In a pioneer work by Gu, Wang and Wen, the concept of equivalence classes of fermionic local unitary(FLU) transformations was proposed to systematically understand non-chiral topological phases in 2D fermion systems and an incomplete classification was obtained. On the other hand, the physical picture of fermion condensation and its corresponding super pivotal categories give rise to a generic mathematical framework to describe fermionic topological phases of quantum matter. In particular, it has been pointed out that in certain fermionic topological phases, there exists the so-called q-type anyon excitations, which have no analogues in bosonic theories. In this paper, we generalize the Gu, Wang and Wen construction to include those fermionic topological phases with q-type anyon excitations. We argue that all non-chiral fermionic topological phases in 2+1D are characterized by a set of tensors $(N^{ij}_{k},F^{ij}_{k},F^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kln,\chi\delta},n_{i},d_{i})$, which satisfy a set of nonlinear algebraic equations parameterized by phase factors $\Xi^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kl}$, $\Xi^{ij}_{kln,\chi\delta}$, $\Omega^{kim,\alpha\beta}_{jl}$ and $\Omega^{ki}_{jln,\chi\delta}$. Moreover, consistency conditions among algebraic equations give rise to additional constraints on these phase factors which allow us to construct a topological invariant partition for an arbitrary triangulation of 3D spin manifold. Finally, several examples with q-type anyon excitations are discussed, including the Fermionic topological phase from Tambara-Yamagami category for $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$, which can be regarded as the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ parafermion generalization of Ising fermionic topological phase.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann-Grad Limit of the Lorentz Gas in a Union of Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz gas describes an ensemble of noninteracting point particles in an infinite array of spherical scatterers. In the present paper we consider the case when the scatterer configuration P is a fixed union of (translated) lattices in R^d, and prove that in the limit of low scatterer density, the particle dynamics converges to a random flight process. In the special case when the lattices in P are pairwise incommensurable, this settles a conjecture from [20]. The proof is carried out by applying a framework developed in recent work by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson [21], and central parts of our proof are the construction of an admissible marking of the point set P, and the verification of the uniform spherical equidistribution condition required in [21]. Regarding the random flight process obtained in the low density limit of the Lorentz gas, we prove that it can be reconstructed from the corresponding limiting flight processes arising from the individual commensurability classes of lattices in P. We furthermore prove that the free path lengths of the limit flight process have a distribution with a power law tail, whose exponent depends on the number of commensurability classes in P.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the patterns, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order R\'enyi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps with four-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nicolai maps offer an alternative description of supersymmetric theories via nonlinear and nonlocal transformations characterized by the so-called `free-action' and `determinant-matching' conditions. The latter expresses the equality of the Jacobian determinant of the transformation with the one obtained by integrating out the fermions, which so far have been considered only to quadratic terms. We argue that such a restriction is not substantial, as Nicolai maps can be constructed for arbitrary nonlinear sigma models, which feature four-fermion interactions. The fermionic effective one-loop action then gets generalized to higher loops and the perturbative tree expansion of such Nicolai maps receives quantum corrections in the form of fermion loop decorations. The `free-action condition' continues to hold for the classical map, but the `determinant-matching condition' is extended to an infinite hierarchy in fermion loop order. After general considerations for sigma models in four dimensions, we specialize to the case of $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^N$ symmetric spaces and construct the associated Nicolai map. These sigma models admit a formulation with only quadratic fermions via an auxiliary vector field, which does not simplify our analysis.</description>

      <title>Global approximate controllability of quantum systems by form perturbations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of infinite-dimensional quantum control systems corresponding to form perturbations of the drift Hamiltonian modulated by a control function. We rely on previous results on controllability of quantum bilinear control systems and obtain a priori $L^1$-bounds of the controls for generic initial and target states. We apply a stability result for the non-autonomous Schr\"odinger equation to extend the results to systems defined by form perturbations, including singular perturbations. As an application of our results, we prove approximate controllability of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional box with a point-interaction with tuneable strength at the centre of the box.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Connections: From Mathematical Foundations Towards Yano-Schr\"odinger Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger connections are a special class of affine connections, which despite being metric incompatible, preserve length of vectors under autoparallel transport. In the present paper, we introduce a novel coordinate-free formulation of Schr\"odinger connections. After recasting their basic properties in the language of differential geometry, we show that Schr\"odinger connections can be realized through torsion, non-metricity, or both. We then calculate the curvature tensors of Yano-Schr\"odinger geometry and present the first explicit example of a non-static Einstein manifold with torsion. We generalize the Raychaudhuri and Sachs equations to the Schr\"odinger geometry. The length-preserving property of these connections enables us to construct a Lagrangian formulation of the Sachs equation. We also obtain an equation for cosmological distances. After this geometric analysis, we build gravitational theories based on Yano-Schr\"odinger geometry, using both a metric and a metric-affine approach. For the latter, we introduce a novel cosmological hyperfluid that will source the Schr\"odinger geometry. Finally, we construct simple cosmological models within these theories and compare our results with observational data as well as the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Local temperature measurement in molecular dynamics simulations with rigid constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining molecules in simulations (such as with constant bond lengths and/or angles) reduces their degrees of freedom (DoF), which in turn affects temperature calculations in those simulations. When local temperatures are measured, e.g. from a set of atoms in a subvolume or from velocities in one Cartesian direction, the result can appear to unphysically violate equipartition of the kinetic energy if the local DoF are not correctly calculated. Here we determine how to correctly calculate local temperatures from arbitrary Cartesian component kinetic energies, accounting for general geometric constraints, by self-consistently evaluating the DoF of atoms subjected to those constraints. The method is validated on a variety of test systems, including systems subject to a temperature gradient and those confined between walls. It is also shown to provide a sensitive test for the breakdown of kinetic energy equipartition caused by the approximate nature of numerical integration or insufficient equilibration times. As a practical demonstration, we show that kinetic energy equipartition between C and H atoms connected by rigid bonds can be violated even at the commonly-used time step of 2 fs, and that this equipartition violation appears to usefully indicate configurational overheating.</description>

      <title>Advection of the image point in probabilistically-reconstructed phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insufficient reference data is ubiquitous in data-driven computational fluid dynamics, as it is usually too expensive to compute or impossible to observe over long enough times needed for data-driven methods to properly operate out of the sampled range. Ultimately, the lack of data can significantly compromise the fidelity of results computed with data-driven methods or make the data-driven approach inapplicable. In order to challenge this problem, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction method which enriches the hyper-parameterisation approach with ideas underlying the probabilistic-evolutionary approach. We offer to use Advection of the image point (a hyper-parameterisation method) on data sampled from the joint probability distribution of the reference dataset. The idea is to blend together the simplicity of the hyper-parameterisation (HP) method with an extra source of reference data provided through sampling from the joint probability distribution.
  The HP method has been tested on the sea surface temperature and surface relative vorticity computed with the global 1/4-deg and 1/12-deg resolution NEMO model. Our results show that the HP solution (the solution computed with the HP method) in the probabilistically-reconstructed and reduced (in terms of dimensionality) phase space at 1/4-deg resolution is more accurate compared to the 1/4-deg solution computed with NEMO and it is also several orders of magnitude faster to compute than the 1/4-deg run. The proposed method shows encouraging results for the NEMO model and the potential for the use in other operational ocean and ocean-atmospheric models for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions. The method can also be used as a fast reanalysis in which the complex dynamics of a comprehensive ocean model is replaced with the HP solution, as well as a dynamic interpolation method to stitch gaps in observational data.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <title>Aliasing and Label-Independent Decomposition of Risk: Beyond the bias-variance trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict function values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, the predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counter-intuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. In contrast to the bias-variance trade-off, we introduce an alternative paradigm called the generalized aliasing decomposition (GAD). We explain the asymptotically small error of complex models as a systematic "de-aliasing" that occurs in the over-parameterized regime. In the limit of large models, the error contribution due to aliasing vanishes, leaving an expression for the asymptotic total error we call the data insufficiency failure of very large models on few training points. Because the generalized aliasing decomposition can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We demonstrate this approach using several examples, including classical regression problems and a cluster expansion model used in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonances of open non-Hermitian systems are associated with the poles of the system scattering matrix. Perturbations of the system cause these poles to shift in the complex frequency plane. In this work, we introduce a novel method for calculating shifts in scattering matrix poles using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We link our method to traditional cavity perturbation theory and validate its effectiveness through application to complex photonic networks. Our findings underscore the versatility of generalized Wigner-Smith operators for analyzing a broad spectrum of resonant systems and provides new insight into resonant properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence rate to the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for Neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for neutron stars. We show that the minimizer $\rho_{c}$ of Chandrasekhar energy $E_c(N)$ converges strongly to the minimizer $\rho_{\infty}$ of limit energy $E_{\infty}(N)$ in $L^1\cap L^{\frac{5}{3}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ as the speed of light $c\rightarrow\infty$, this is a limit between two free boundary problems. Moreover, we develop a novel approach to obtain the convergence rates, we show that the above nonrelativistic limit has the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$. For the radius $R_c$ of the compact support of $\rho_c(x)$ and the radius $R_\infty$ of the compact support of $\rho_\infty(x)$, we also get the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$, this means that $R_\infty-R_c=O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ as $c\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we also obtain the optimal uniform bounds of $R_c$ and $L^\infty$-norm of $\rho_c$ with respect to $N$ as $c\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for supersymmetric sigma models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>
