      <title>Online Training of Hopfield Networks using Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have progressed in tandem, each contributing to our understanding of the brain, and inspiring recent developments in biologically-plausible neural networks (NNs) and learning rules. Predictive coding (PC), and its learning rule, have been shown to approximate error backpropagation in a biologically relevant manner, with local weight updates that depend only on the activity of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Unlike traditional feedforward NNs where the flow of information goes in one direction, PC models mimic the brain more accurately by passing information bidirectionally: prediction in one direction, and correction/error in the other. PC models learn by clamping some neurons to target values and running the network to equilibrium. At equilibrium, the network calculates its own error gradients right at the location where they are used for weight updates. Traditional backprop requires the computation graph to be feedforward. However, the PC version of backprop does not have this requirement. Amazingly, no one has demonstrated the application of PC learning directly to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Hopfield networks (HNs) are RNNs that implement a content-addressable memory, learning patterns (or ``memories'') that can be retrieved from partial or corrupted patterns. In this paper, we show that a HN can be trained using the PC learning rules without modification. To our knowledge, this is the first time PC learning has been applied directly to train a RNN, without the need to unroll it in time. Our results indicate that the PC-trained HNs behave like classical HNs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Evolutionary Optimization of Network Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Task Evolutionary Optimization (MTEO), an important field focusing on addressing complex problems through optimizing multiple tasks simultaneously, has attracted much attention. While MTEO has been primarily focusing on task similarity, there remains a hugely untapped potential in harnessing the shared characteristics between different domains to enhance evolutionary optimization. For example, real-world complex systems usually share the same characteristics, such as the power-law rule, small-world property, and community structure, thus making it possible to transfer solutions optimized in one system to another to facilitate the optimization. Drawing inspiration from this observation of shared characteristics within complex systems, we set out to extend MTEO to a novel framework - multi-domain evolutionary optimization (MDEO). To examine the performance of the proposed MDEO, we utilize a challenging combinatorial problem of great security concern - community deception in complex networks as the optimization task. To achieve MDEO, we propose a community-based measurement of graph similarity to manage the knowledge transfer among domains. Furthermore, we develop a graph representation-based network alignment model that serves as the conduit for effectively transferring solutions between different domains. Moreover, we devise a self-adaptive mechanism to determine the number of transferred solutions from different domains and introduce a novel mutation operator based on the learned mapping to facilitate the utilization of knowledge from other domains. Experiments on eight real-world networks of different domains demonstrate MDEO superiority in efficacy compared to classical evolutionary optimization. Simulations of attacks on the community validate the effectiveness of the proposed MDEO in safeguarding community security.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Rewards for Food and Motor Action by Simulating Birth and Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reward system is one of the fundamental drivers of animal behaviors and is critical for survival and reproduction. Despite its importance, the problem of how the reward system has evolved is underexplored. In this paper, we try to replicate the evolution of biologically plausible reward functions and investigate how environmental conditions affect evolved rewards' shape. For this purpose, we developed a population-based decentralized evolutionary simulation framework, where agents maintain their energy level to live longer and produce more children. Each agent inherits its reward function from its parent subject to mutation and learns to get rewards via reinforcement learning throughout its lifetime. Our results show that biologically reasonable positive rewards for food acquisition and negative rewards for motor action can evolve from randomly initialized ones. However, we also find that the rewards for motor action diverge into two modes: largely positive and slightly negative. The emergence of positive motor action rewards is surprising because it can make agents too active and inefficient in foraging. In environments with poor and poisonous foods, the evolution of rewards for less important foods tends to be unstable, while rewards for normal foods are still stable. These results demonstrate the usefulness of our simulation environment and energy-dependent birth and death model for further studies of the origin of reward systems.</description>

      <title>Micro-power spoken keyword spotting on Xylo Audio 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many years, designs for "Neuromorphic" or brain-like processors have been motivated by achieving extreme energy efficiency, compared with von-Neumann and tensor processor devices. As part of their design language, Neuromorphic processors take advantage of weight, parameter, state and activity sparsity. In the extreme case, neural networks based on these principles mimic the sparse activity oof biological nervous systems, in ``Spiking Neural Networks'' (SNNs). Few benchmarks are available for Neuromorphic processors, that have been implemented for a range of Neuromorphic and non-Neuromorphic platforms, which can therefore demonstrate the energy benefits of Neuromorphic processor designs. Here we describes the implementation of a spoken audio keyword-spotting (KWS) benchmark "Aloha" on the Xylo Audio 2 (SYNS61210) Neuromorphic processor device. We obtained high deployed quantized task accuracy, (95%), exceeding the benchmark task accuracy. We measured real continuous power of the deployed application on Xylo. We obtained best-in-class dynamic inference power ($291\mu$W) and best-in-class inference efficiency ($6.6\mu$J / Inf). Xylo sets a new minimum power for the Aloha KWS benchmark, and highlights the extreme energy efficiency achievable with Neuromorphic processor designs. Our results show that Neuromorphic designs are well-suited for real-time near- and in-sensor processing on edge devices.</description>

      <title>LLM2FEA: Discover Novel Designs with Generative Evolutionary Multitasking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid research and development of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the generation of high-quality images, text, and 3D models from text prompts. This advancement impels an inquiry into whether these models can be leveraged to create digital artifacts for both creative and engineering applications. Drawing on innovative designs from other domains may be one answer to this question, much like the historical practice of ``bionics", where humans have sought inspiration from nature's exemplary designs. This raises the intriguing possibility of using generative models to simultaneously tackle design tasks across multiple domains, facilitating cross-domain learning and resulting in a series of innovative design solutions. In this paper, we propose LLM2FEA as the first attempt to discover novel designs in generative models by transferring knowledge across multiple domains. By utilizing a multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) to drive a large language model, LLM2FEA integrates knowledge from various fields to generate prompts that guide the generative model in discovering novel and practical objects. Experimental results in the context of 3D aerodynamic design verify the discovery capabilities of the proposed LLM2FEA. The designs generated by LLM2FEA not only satisfy practicality requirements to a certain degree but also feature novel and aesthetically pleasing shapes, demonstrating the potential applications of LLM2FEA in discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>

      <title>Jack and Masters of all Trades: One-Pass Learning Sets of Model Sets From Large Pre-Trained Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For deep learning, size is power. Massive neural nets trained on broad data for a spectrum of tasks are at the forefront of artificial intelligence. These large pre-trained models or Jacks of All Trades (JATs), when fine-tuned for downstream tasks, are gaining importance in driving deep learning advancements. However, environments with tight resource constraints, changing objectives and intentions, or varied task requirements, could limit the real-world utility of a singular JAT. Hence, in tandem with current trends towards building increasingly large JATs, this paper conducts an initial exploration into concepts underlying the creation of a diverse set of compact machine learning model sets. Composed of many smaller and specialized models, the Set of Sets is formulated to simultaneously fulfil many task settings and environmental conditions. A means to arrive at such a set tractably in one pass of a neuroevolutionary multitasking algorithm is presented for the first time, bringing us closer to models that are collectively Masters of All Trades.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity for Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal structures are indispensable across various domains, from batteries to solar cells, and extensive research has been dedicated to predicting their properties based on their atomic configurations. However, prevailing Crystal Structure Prediction methods focus on identifying the most stable solutions that lie at the global minimum of the energy function. This approach overlooks other potentially interesting materials that lie in neighbouring local minima and have different material properties such as conductivity or resistance to deformation. By contrast, Quality-Diversity algorithms provide a promising avenue for Crystal Structure Prediction as they aim to find a collection of high-performing solutions that have diverse characteristics. However, it may also be valuable to optimise for the stability of crystal structures alongside other objectives such as magnetism or thermoelectric efficiency. Therefore, in this work, we harness the power of Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity algorithms in order to find crystal structures which have diverse features and achieve different trade-offs of objectives. We analyse our approach on 5 crystal systems and demonstrate that it is not only able to re-discover known real-life structures, but also find promising new ones. Moreover, we propose a method for illuminating the objective space to gain an understanding of what trade-offs can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Discovering Dynamic Symbolic Policies with Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being applied to solve control problems. However, control systems developed in AI are often black-box methods, in that it is not clear how and why they generate their outputs. A lack of transparency can be problematic for control tasks in particular, because it complicates the identification of biases or errors, which in turn negatively influences the user's confidence in the system. To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, the black-box structure can be replaced with white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. Genetic programming offers a gradient-free method to optimise the structure of non-differentiable mathematical expressions. In this paper, we show that genetic programming can be used to discover symbolic control systems. This is achieved by learning a symbolic representation of a function that transforms observations into control signals. We consider both systems that implement static control policies without memory and systems that implement dynamic memory-based control policies. In case of the latter, the discovered function becomes the state equation of a differential equation, which allows for evidence integration. Our results show that symbolic policies are discovered that perform comparably with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the additional value of the memory capacity in the dynamic policies is demonstrated on experiments where static policies fall short. Overall, we demonstrate that white-box symbolic policies can be optimised with genetic programming, while offering interpretability and transparency that lacks in black-box models.</description>

      <title>MeGA: Merging Multiple Independently Trained Neural Networks Based on Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for merging the weights of multiple pre-trained neural networks using a genetic algorithm called MeGA. Traditional techniques, such as weight averaging and ensemble methods, often fail to fully harness the capabilities of pre-trained networks. Our approach leverages a genetic algorithm with tournament selection, crossover, and mutation to optimize weight combinations, creating a more effective fusion. This technique allows the merged model to inherit advantageous features from both parent models, resulting in enhanced accuracy and robustness. Through experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we demonstrate that our genetic algorithm-based weight merging method improves test accuracy compared to individual models and conventional methods. This approach provides a scalable solution for integrating multiple pre-trained networks across various deep learning applications.

      <description>arXiv:2405.03701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting, to estimate future events, is crucial for business and decision-making. This paper proposes QxEAI, a methodology that produces a probabilistic forecast that utilizes a quantum-like evolutionary algorithm based on training a quantum-like logic decision tree and a classical value tree on a small number of related time series. We demonstrate how the application of our quantum-like evolutionary algorithm to forecasting can overcome the challenges faced by classical and other machine learning approaches. By using three real-world datasets (Dow Jones Index, retail sales, gas consumption), we show how our methodology produces accurate forecasts while requiring little to none manual work.</description>
