      <title>Tropicalized quantum field theory and global tropical sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how to tropicalize scalar quantum field theory and show that tropicalized massive scalar quantum field theory is exactly solvable. This exact solution manifests as a non-linear recursion equation fulfilled by the expansion coefficients of the quantum effective action. Geometrically, this recursion computes specific volumes of moduli spaces of metric graphs and is thereby analogous to Mirzakhani's volume recursions on the moduli space of curves. Building on this exact solution, we construct an algorithm that samples points from the moduli space of graphs approximately proportional to their perturbative contribution. Remarkably, this algorithm requires only polynomial time and memory, suggesting that perturbative quantum field theory computations lie in the polynomial-time complexity class, while all known algorithms for evaluating individual Feynman integrals are exponential in time and memory. To demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm, we evaluate the primitive contribution to the $\phi^4$ beta function at 50 loops with a proof-of-concept implementation.</description>

      <title>Average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The onset of quantum ergodicity is often quantified by the average ratio of consecutive level spacings. The reference values for ergodic quantum systems have been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional random matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for random matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlev\'e differential equation is solved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic quantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry. A Wigner surmise-inspired analytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for the statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry classes. For Poissonian level statistics, a significantly different average is found, indicating that the average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings can be used as a probe for quantum ergodicity.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by Carrollian geometry, we define super-Carrollian manifolds as a supermanifold with an even degenerate metric such that the kernel is generated by a non-singular odd vector field that is a supersymmetry generator. Alongside other results, we show that compatible affine connections always exist, albeit they must carry torsion.</description>

      <title>Multi-player conflict avoidance through entangled quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems faster and more efficiently than classical computing. It can achieve speedups by leveraging quantum phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and tunneling. Quantum walks (QWs) form the foundation for many quantum algorithms. Unlike classical random walks, QWs exhibit quantum interference, leading to unique behaviors such as linear spreading and localization. These properties make QWs valuable for various applications, including universal computation, time series prediction, encryption, and quantum hash functions. One emerging application of QWs is decision making. Previous research has used QWs to model human decision processes and solve multi-armed bandit problems. This paper extends QWs to collective decision making, focusing on minimizing decision-conflict cases where multiple agents choose the same option, leading to inefficiencies like traffic congestion or overloaded servers. Prior research using quantum interference has addressed two-player conflict avoidance but struggled with three-player scenarios. This paper proposes a novel method using QWs to entirely eliminate decision conflicts in three-player cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in collective decision making.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for correctness of complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a family of correctness conditions for complex Langevin simulations. In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation values of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's Schwinger--Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation values are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in the context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general probability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on a real manifold. We test these criteria in a few simple one- and two-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out incorrect results without the need of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Singularity of the axisymmetric stagnation-point-like solution within a cylinder of the 3D Euler incompressible fluid equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate analytically the formation of finite time singularities in the three dimensional incompressible Euler equations under the model of Gibbon, Fokas, and Doering for vorticity stretching within a bounded cylindrical domain and under axisymmetric conditions. We derive explicit Lagrangian solutions for the vorticity, its stretching rate, fluid pathlines, and velocity components by exploiting constants of motion associated with the field dependent infinitesimal symmetries of the system. The central finding is that the existence and nature of a finite time singularity are determined exclusively by the local geometric structure of the initial vortex stretching rate near its global minimum. Whether a singularity forms depends on how flat this profile is at the minimum. Flatter profiles delay the blowup and sufficient flatness can suppress it entirely. For power law behavior near the minimum, critical thresholds for the exponent are identified which separate regular solutions from those that develop a finite time singularity. These thresholds differ depending on whether the singularity occurs at the centre of the cylinder or on a ring away from the centre, with minima at the centre requiring higher flatness to avoid blowup. This work provides a rigorous analytical framework that elucidates how the local geometric structure of the initial conditions governs the potential for singularity formation in 3D fluid flows, offering fundamental insights into the interplay between symmetry, initial data, and the development of extreme events in idealised turbulence.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold $M$ into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise.
  We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds.
  We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers.
  We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties.
  Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities.
  Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting.
  We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>

      <title>Twisted Dirac operators and fractional correlations of the massless sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the massless sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point, in infinite volume, we define the fractional (charge or vertex operator) correlation functions from the probabilistic path integral and prove that they are given by renormalized determinants of massive twisted Dirac operators. The fractional correlation functions are the moments of the imaginary multiplicative chaos, a random generalized function that we construct with respect to the infinite-volume massless sine-Gordon measure. The renormalized determinants are the tau functions of Sato--Miwa--Jimbo as identified by Palmer.
  The construction and a priori control of the imaginary multiplicative chaos combines methods from stochastic analysis (of singular SPDE flavor) for short-scale regularity with qualitative input from integrability for large-scale control. The exact identification of the correlation functions with the renormalized determinants relies on finite-volume approximation, regularity estimates for the mass perturbation, and analytic continuation in the coupling constant.
  The combination of existing results for tau functions with our identification implies various predictions for the sine-Gordon model such as that the fractional two-point functions are expressed as Fredholm determinants and satisfy certain PDEs as predicted by Bernard--LeClair. Using asymptotics of Fredholm determinants of Basor--Tracy and mixing of the massless sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point, which we prove, we further derive the exact formula for the one-point function predicted by Lukyanov--Zamolodchikov (at the free fermion point).</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics, non-locality, and the space discreteness hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space discreteness hypothesis asserts that the nature of space at short distances is radically different from that at large distances. Based on the Bronstein inequality, here, we use a totally disconnected topological space $\mathcal{X}$ as a model for the space. However, we consider the time as a real variable. In this framework, the formalism of Dirac-von Neumann can be used. This discreteness hypothesis implies that given two different points in space, there is no continuous curve (a world line) joining them. Consequently, this hypothesis is not compatible with the theory of relativity. We propose $\mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{X})^{3}$ as a model of a space-time. For simplicity, we work out our models using $\mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{X})$ as the configuration space. Quantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, on the Hilbert space $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{X})$ is a non-local theory: the Hamiltonians are non-local operators, and thus, spooky action at a distance is allowed. The paradigm asserting that the universe is non-locally real implies that the proposed version of QM admits realism. This version of QM can be specialized to standard QM by using Hamiltonians acting on wavefunctions supported on the region $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$. We apply the developed formalism to the measurement problem. We propose a new mechanism for the collapse of the wavefunction. The mechanism resembles the one proposed by Ghirardi, Ramini, and Weber, but there are significant differences. The most important feature is that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation describes the dynamics at all times, even at the moment of measurement. We also discuss a model for the two-slit experiment, where bright and dark states of light (proposed recently) naturally occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.07096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the truncated correlation functions of the charge and gradient fields associated with the massless sine-Gordon model on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\beta=4\pi$ exist for all coupling constants and are equal to those of the chiral densities and vector current of free massive Dirac fermions. This is an instance of Coleman's prediction that the massless sine-Gordon model and the massive Thirring model are equivalent (in the above sense of correlation functions). Our main novelty is that we prove this correspondence starting from the Euclidean path integral in the non-perturative regime of the infinite volume models. We use this correspondence to show that the correlation functions of the massless sine-Gordon model with $\beta=4\pi$ decay exponentially and that the corresponding probabilistic field is localized.</description>

      <title>Degenerate conformal blocks for the $W_3$ algebra at c=2 and connection probabilities in the triple dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a homogeneous system of $d+8$ linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in $d$ variables arising from two-dimensional Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) with a $W_3$-symmetry algebra. In the CFT context, $d$ PDEs are third-order and correspond to the null-state equations, whereas the remaining 8 PDEs (five being second-order and three being first-order) correspond to the $W_3$ global Ward identities. In the case of central charge $c=2$, we construct a subspace of the space of all solutions which grow no faster than a power law. We call this subspace the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks, and we provide a basis expressed in terms of Specht polynomials associated with column-strict, rectangular Young tableaux with three columns. The dimension of this space is a Kostka number which coincides with CFT predictions, hence we conjecture that it exhausts the space of all solutions having a power law bound. Moreover, we prove that the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks is an irreducible representation of a certain diagram algebra defined from $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs that we call Kuperberg algebra. Finally, we prove a formula relating the $W_3$ conformal blocks at $c=2$ we constructed to Kenyon and Shi's scaling limits of connection probabilities in the triple dimer model. For more general central charges, we expect that $W_3$ conformal blocks are related to scaling limits of probabilities in lattice models based on $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs.</description>

      <title>Properties of the temporal transfer matrix in integrable Floquet circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One possible approach to studying non-equilibrium dynamics is the so-called influence matrix (IM) formalism. The influence matrix can be viewed as a quantum state that encodes complete information about the non-equilibrium dynamics of a boundary degree of freedom. It has been shown that the IM is the unique stationary point of the temporal transfer matrix. This transfer matrix, however, is non-diagonalizable and exhibits a non-trivial Jordan block structure. In this article, we demonstrate that, in the case of an integrable XXZ spin chain, the temporal transfer matrix itself is integrable and can be embedded into a family of commuting operators. We further provide the exact expression for the IM as a particular limit of a Bethe wavefunction, with the corresponding Bethe roots given explicitly. We also focus on the special case of the free-fermionic XX chain. In this setting, we uncover additional local integrals of motion, which enable us to analyze the dimensions and structure of the Jordan blocks, as well as the locality properties of the IM. Moreover, we construct a basis of quasi-local creation operators that generate the IM from the vacuum state.</description>

Abstract: We study duality transformations of the star-square relation and the generalized star-triangle relation for Ising-like integrable lattice spin models. The integrable models are obtained via gauge/YBE correspondence which connects the supersymmetric gauge theories and lattice spin models of statistical mechanics. By the use of integral identities coming from the duality of three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, we construct hyperbolic, lens hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational solutions to the duality transformations. These duality transformations allow us to construct spin lattice models with four-spin (the star-square relation) and three-spin (the generalized star-triangle relation) interactions.</description>

      <title>Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes of type II in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $1+1+2$ covariant formalism in the presence of nonmetricity. Focusing on Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes, we show how nonmetricity affects all the kinematic quantities involved in the covariant $1+1+2$ decomposition. We apply the resulting geometrical framework to study both homogeneous solutions and static spherically symmetric solutions in the context of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity. We obtain sufficient conditions for homogeneous solutions with flat spatial hypersurfaces and Schwarzschild-de Sitter type solutions in the $1+1+2$ formalism. We also explore an elementary gravastar solution utilizing covariant junction conditions.</description>

      <title>Note on Dirac monopole theory and Berry geometric phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work reveals the intrinsic connection between Dirac monopole theory and Berry geometric phases by extending Dirac's theory to the parameter space. Using the simplest two-mode Hamiltonian model, we explicitly visualize Dirac strings with endpoints in the parameter space, demonstrating that these endpoints correspond to accidental degeneracy points of energy eigenvalues in Hermitian systems. We show that non-integrable phase factors, induced by such Dirac strings, directly give rise to the well-known Berry connection and curvature, which can be derived rigorously via Dirac's monopole framework. Our results indicate that the Berry geometric phase is essentially the non-integrable phase factor induced by Dirac strings with endpoints in the parameter space. This establishes a unified and effective approach to study monopoles and geometric phases, particularly applicable when Berry's framework fails.</description>

      <title>The Newtonian limit of orthonormal frames in metric theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <title>Low-density parity-check codes as stable phases of quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.</description>

      <title>Surface sums for lattice Yang-Mills in the large-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sum over weighted planar surfaces formula for Wilson loop expectations in the large-$N$ limit of strongly coupled lattice Yang-Mills theory, in any dimension. The weights of each surface are simple and expressed in terms of products of signed Catalan numbers.
  In establishing our results, the main novelty is to convert a recursive relation for Wilson loop expectations, known as the master loop equation, into a new peeling exploration of the planar surfaces. This exploration reveals hidden cancellations within the sums, enabling a deeper understanding of the structure of the planar surfaces.
  We view our results as a continuation of the program initiated in [CPS23] to understand Yang-Mills theories via surfaces and as a refinement of the string trajectories point-of-view developed in [Cha19a].</description>

      <title>On the extremal eigenvalues of Jacobi ensembles at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the $\beta$-Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi ensembles of dimension $N$ there exist central limit theorems for the freezing case $\beta\to\infty$ such that the associated means and covariances can be expressed in terms of the associated Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials of order $N$ respectively as well as via the associated dual polynomials in the sense of de Boor and Saff. In this paper we derive limits for $N\to\infty$ for the covariances of the $r\in\mathbb N$ largest (and smallest) eigenvalues for these frozen Jacobi ensembles in terms of Bessel functions. These results correspond to the hard edge analysis in the frozen Laguerre cases by Andraus and Lerner-Brecher and to known results for finite $\beta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the Calogero-Sutherland-type (CS-type) models and generalized hypergeometric functions. We construct the generalized CS operators for circular, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel cases and establish the generalized Lassalle-Nekrasov correspondence. A family of operators are constructed based on the spherical degenerate double affine Hecke algebra. In terms of these operators, we provide concise representations and constraints for the generalized hypergeometric functions. We analyze the superintegrability for the $\beta$-deformed integrals, where the measures are associated with the corresponding ground state wave functions of Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel type CS models. Then based on the generalized Laplace transformation of Jack polynomials, we construct certain two integral chains and analyze the superintegrability property.</description>

      <title>Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes offer a promising path to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation but lack systematic strategies for exploration. In this Letter, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. In addition to efficient characterizations using Gr\"obner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem. This approach allows us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choices of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their intrinsic link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and derive an efficient method for generating finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our Letter provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Markov property on planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit, in a self contained way, the Markov property on planar maps and decorated planar maps from three perspectives. First, we characterize the laws on these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting invariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps, satisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to those obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the Boltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that halt exploration mid-edge.</description>

      <title>A generalized Birman-Schwinger principle and applications to one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a self-adjoint operator $H_0$ bounded from below in a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, the corresponding scale of spaces $\mathcal{H}_{+1}(H_0) \subset \mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{H}_{-1}(H_0) = [\mathcal{H}_{+1}(H_0)]^*$, and a fixed $V\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_{+1}(H_0),\mathcal{H}_{-1}(H_0))$, we define the operator-valued map $A_V(\,\cdot\,):\rho(H_0)\to \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ by \[ A_V(z):=-\big(H_0-zI_{\mathcal{H}} \big)^{-1/2}V\big(H_0-zI_{\mathcal{H}} \big)^{-1/2}\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}),\quad z\in \rho(H_0), \] where $\rho(H_0)$ denotes the resolvent set of $H_0$. Assuming that $A_V(z)$ is compact for some $z=z_0\in \rho(H_0)$ and has norm strictly less than one for some $z=E_0\in (-\infty,0)$, we employ an abstract version of Tiktopoulos' formula to define an operator $H$ in $\mathcal{H}$ that is formally realized as the sum of $H_0$ and $V$. We then establish a Birman-Schwinger principle for $H$ in which $A_V(\,\cdot\,)$ plays the role of the Birman-Schwinger operator: $\lambda_0\in \rho(H_0)$ is an eigenvalue of $H$ if and only if $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A_V(\lambda_0)$. Furthermore, the geometric (but not necessarily the algebraic) multiplicities of $\lambda_0$ and $1$ as eigenvalues of $H$ and $A_V(\lambda_0)$, respectively, coincide.
  As a concrete application, we consider one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R})$ distributional potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the microscopic statistics of a Coulomb gas in $\mathbb{R}^2$ at intermediate temperatures. In particular, we show that the microscopic point process associated to the Coulomb gas converges to a homogeneous Poisson point process at intermediate temperature regimes $\beta N \rightarrow \infty$ and $\beta \sqrt{N} \log N \rightarrow 0$, extending previous results. Our approach relies on a novel quantitative asymptotic description of correlation functions, which is of its own interest.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$. Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band, which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$, classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$ follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for completeness.</description>

      <title>Stability of spinorial Sobolev inequalities on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spinorial Sobolev inequality on the unit sphere states \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq 0, \end{equation*} with equality if and only if $\psi \in {\mathcal M}$, the set of all $-\frac 12$-Killing spinors and their conformal transformations.
  Our main result in this paper is to refine this inequality by establishing a stability inequality
  \begin{equation*} \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq {\bf c}_S\inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{M}}\Big(\int| D(\psi-\phi)|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}.
  \end{equation*}
  As a by-product of our argument, we show that elements in set $\mathcal M$ are not optimizers of another spinorial Sobolev inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}} \geq C_S \Big(\int|\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n-1}}\Big)^{\frac{n-1}{n}},
  \end{equation*}
  unlike expected by experts. They have in fact index $n+1$ and nullity $2^{[\frac n2]+2}$.</description>
