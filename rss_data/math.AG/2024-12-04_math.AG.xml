      <title>Certifying nontriviality of Ceresa classes of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ceresa cycle is a canonical algebraic $1$-cycle on the Jacobian of an algebraic curve. We construct an algorithm which, given a curve over a number field, often provides a certificate that the Ceresa cycle is non-torsion, without relying on the presence of any additional symmetries of the curve. Under the hypothesis that the Sato--Tate group is the whole of $\operatorname*{GSp}$, we prove that if the Ceresa class (the image of the Ceresa cycle in \'{e}tale cohomology) is non-torsion, then the algorithm will eventually terminate with a certificate attesting to this fact.</description>

      <title>Positivity of double point divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-isomorphic locus of a general projection from an embedded smooth projective variety to a hypersurface moves in a linear system of an effective divisor which we call the double point divisor. David Mumford proved that the double point divisor from outer projection is always base point free, and Bo Ilic proved that it is ample except for a Roth variety. The first aim of this paper is to show that the double point divisor from outer projection is very ample except in the Roth case. This answers a question of Bo Ilic. Unlike the case of outer projection, the double point divisor from inner projection may not be base point free nor ample. However, Atsushi Noma proved that it is semiample except when a variety is neither a Roth variety, a scroll over a curve, nor the second Veronese surface. In this paper, we investigate when the double point divisor from inner projection is base point free or big.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a K3 surface, let $C$ be a smooth curve of genus $g$ on $X$, and let $A$ be a base point free and primitive line bundle $g_d^r$ on $C$ with $d\geq4$ and $r\geq\sqrt{\frac{d}{2}}$. In this paper, we prove that if $g&gt;2d-3+(r-1)^2$, then there exists a line bundle $N$ on $X$ which is adapted to $|C|$ such that $|A|$ is contained in the linear system $|N\otimes\mathcal{O}_C|$, and ${\rm{Cliff}}(N\otimes\mathcal{O}_C)\leq {\rm{Cliff}}(A)$.</description>

Abstract: For every complete toric variety, there exists a projective toric variety which is isomorphic to it in codimension one.

      <description>arXiv:2412.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns and the data of the minimal resolution of a complex curve singularity: using Popescu-Pampu's notion of the lotus of a singularity, we describe a bijection between the dual resolution graphs of Newton non-degenerate plane curve singularities and Conway-Coxeter friezes. We use representation theoretic reduction methods to interpret some of the entries of the frieze coming from the partial resolutions of the corresponding curve singularity. Finally, we translate the notion of mutation, coming from cluster combinatorics, to resolutions of plane complex curves.</description>

      <title>Separating semigroup of genus 4 curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational function on a real algebraic curve $C$ is called separating if it takes real values only at real points. Such a function defines a covering $\mathbb R C\to\mathbb{RP}^1$. Let $c_1,\dots,c_r$ be connected components of $\mathbb R C$. M. Kummer and K. Shaw defined the separating semigroup of $C$ as the set of all sequences $(d_1(f),\dots,d_r(f))$ where $f$ is a separating function and $d_i(f)$ is the degree of the restriction of $f$ to $c_i$.
  In the present paper we describe the separating semigroups of all genus 4 curves. For the proofs we consider the canonical embedding of $C$ into a quadric $X$ in $\mathbb P^3$ and apply Abel's theorem to 1-forms obtained as Poincar\'e residues at $C$ of certain meromorphic 2-forms on $X$.</description>

      <title>Fixed locus dimension of diagonalizable $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain lower bounds for the dimension of fixed loci of abelian $p$-groups acting on smooth projective varieties. Those arise from modulo p Chern numbers, and are shown to be optimal. The bounds are expressed in a natural way by introducing an appropriate filtration on the modulo $p$ cobordism ring. They are obtained using equivariant localization methods, via the concentration theorem, and by a technique of "partition dividing".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Tian that the global log canonical threshold (known as the $\alpha$-invariant) is equal to the level $k$ log canonical threshold (known as the $\alpha_k$-invariant) for all sufficiently large $k$. A weaker folklore conjecture has been that the invariants $\alpha_k$ are eventually monotone. We provide a counterexample to both conjectures.</description>

      <title>Chow-Lam Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conditions under which a subvariety of the Grassmannian may be recovered from certain of its linear projections. In the special case that our Grassmannian is projective space, this is equivalent to asking when a variety can be recovered from its Chow form; the answer is "always" by work of Chow in 1937. In the general Grassmannian setting, the analogous question is when a variety can be recovered from its Chow-Lam form. We give both necessary conditions for recovery and families of examples where, in contrast with the projective case, recovery is not possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Postnikov--Stanley polynomials $D_u^w$ are a generalization of skew dual Schubert polynomials to the setting of arbitrary Weyl groups. We prove that Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are Lorentzian by showing that they are degree polynomials of Richardson varieties. Our result yields an interesting class of Lorentzian polynomials related to the geometry of Richardson varieties, generalizes the result that dual Schubert polynomials are Lorentzian (Huh--Matherne--M\'esz\'aros--St. Dizier 2022), and resolves the conjecture that Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are M-convex (An--Tung--Zhang 2024).</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^?0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^?0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We apply our construction to show that the vanishing problem is in ${\sf NP}_{\mathbb{C}} \cap {\sf P}_{\mathbb{R}}$ in the Blum--Shub--Smale (BSS) model of computation over complex and real numbers respectively. Similarly, we prove that computing Schubert coefficients is in $\#{\sf P}_{\mathbb{C}}$, a counting version of the BSS model. We also extend our results to classical types. With one notable exception of the vanishing problem in type $D$, all our results extend to all types.</description>

      <title>Kolyvagin's conjecture for modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main result in this article is a proof (under mild technical assumptions) of an analogue for $p$-adic Galois representations attached to a newform $f$ of even weight $k\geq4$ of Kolyvagin's conjecture on the $p$-indivisibility of derived Heegner points on elliptic curves, where $p$ is a prime number that is ordinary for $f$. Our strategy, which is inspired by work of W. Zhang in weight $2$, is based on a variant for modular forms of the congruence method originally introduced by Bertolini-Darmon to prove one divisibility in the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for rational elliptic curves. We adapt to higher (even) weight modular forms this approach via congruences, building crucially on results of Wang on the indivisibility of Heegner cycles over Shimura curves. Then we offer an application of our results on Kolyvagin's conjecture to the Tamagawa number conjecture for the motive of $f$ and describe other (standard) consequences on structure theorems for Bloch-Kato-Selmer groups, $p$-parity results and converse theorems for $f$. Since in the present paper we need $p&gt;k+1$, our main theorem and its applications can be viewed as complementary to results obtained by the first and third authors in their article on the Tamagawa number conjecture for modular motives, where Kolyvagin's conjecture was proved (in a completely different way exploiting the arithmetic of Hida families) under the assumption that $k$ is congruent to $2$ modulo $2(p-1)$, which forces $p&lt;k$. In forthcoming work, we will use results contained in this paper to prove (under analogous assumptions) the counterpart for an even weight newform $f$ of Perrin-Riou's Heegner point main conjecture for elliptic curves ("Heegner cycle main conjecture" for $f$).</description>

      <title>From K\"ahler Ricci solitons to Calabi-Yau K\"ahler cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $X$ is a smooth Fano manifold which caries a K\"ahler Ricci soliton, then the canonical cone of the product of $X$ with a complex projective space of sufficiently large dimension is a Calabi--Yau cone. This can be seen as an asymptotic version of a conjecture by Mabuchi and Nikagawa. This result is obtained by the openness of the set of weight functions $v$ over the momentum polytope of a given smooth Fano manifold, for which a $v$-soliton exists. We discuss other ramifications of this approach, including a Licherowicz type obstruction to the existence of a K\"ahler Ricci soliton and a Fujita type volume bound for the existence of a $v$-soliton.</description>

      <title>Fourier--Mukai partners and generalized Kummer structures on generalized Kummer surfaces of order $3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized Kummer surface $X$ of order $3$ is the minimal resolution of the quotient of an abelian surface $A$ by an order $3$ symplectic automorphism. We study a generalization of a problem of Shioda for classical Kummer surfaces, which is to understand how much $X$ is determined by $A$ and conversely. The surface $X$ posses a big and nef divisor $L_{X}$ such that $L_{X}^{2}=0$ or $2$ mod $6$. We show that for surfaces with $L_{X}^{2}=6k$ with $k\neq0,6\,mod\,9$, the surface $X$ determines the transcendental lattice $T(A)$ of $A$ and the Hodge structure on $T(A)$. Conversely if $A$ and $B$ are Fourier-Mukai partners (i.e. if the Hodge structures of their transcendental lattices are isomorphic) and $Y$ is the generalized Kummer surface which is the minimal resolution of the quotient of $B$ by an order $3$ symplectic automorphism, we obtain that $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic. These results are also know to hold for surfaces with $L_{X}^{2}=2\,mod\,6$ from a previous work. When $k=0\text{ or }6\,mod\,9,$ we show that $X$ determines $T(A)$ and its Hodge structure, but the converse does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Arrangements in the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic of a very affine variety encodes the algebraic complexity of solving likelihood (or scattering) equations on this variety. We study this quantity for the Grassmannian with $d$ hyperplane sections removed. We provide a combinatorial formula, and explain how to compute this Euler characteristic in practice, both symbolically and numerically. Our particular focus is on generic hyperplane sections and on Schubert divisors. We also consider special Schubert arrangements relevant for physics. We study both the complex and the real case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct examples of nodal quartic double solids that admit uniformly rational, and so elliptic in Gromov' sense, small algebraic resolutions.</description>

      <title>On Brauer groups of tame stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop some general tools for computing the Brauer group of a tame algebraic stack $\mathscr X$ by studying the difference between it and the Brauer group of the coarse space $X$ of $\mathscr X$. It is our hope that these tools will be used to simplify future computations of Brauer groups of stacks. Informally, we show that $\operatorname{Br}\mathscr X$ is often built from $\operatorname{Br} X$ and "information about the Picard groups of the fibers of $\mathscr X\to X$''. Along these lines, we compute, for example, the Brauer group of the moduli stack $\mathscr Y(1)_S$ of elliptic curves, over any regular noetherian $\mathbb Z[1/2]$-scheme $S$ as well as the Brauer groups of (many) stacky curves (allowing generic stabilizers) over algebraically closed fields.</description>

      <title>Relative Stability Conditions on Triangulated Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of relative stability conditions on triangulated categories with respect to left admissible subcategories, based on arXiv:math/0212237, and demonstrate the deformation of relative stability conditions via the deformation of gluing stability conditions in arXiv:0902.0323. The motivation for this concept stems from the discussions in arXiv:2004.04831 concerning the relationship between Bridgeland stability and the existence of the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics on line bundles.</description>

      <title>On Lurie's theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.00482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lurie's theorem states that there exists a sheaf of ring spectra on the site of formally \'etale Deligne--Mumford stacks over the moduli stack of $p$-divisible groups of height $n$, which agrees with the classical Landweber exact functor theorem (LEFT) on affines. In other words, this theorem is a global, higher categorical refinement of the LEFT. In recent work, Lurie has introduced many of the ingredients one needs to prove this theorem, and in this article, we gather these ingredients together and prove Lurie's theorem. Applications of this theorem to Lubin--Tate theories, topological modular and automorphism forms, and Adams operations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Functions of Chopped Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A chopped ideal is obtained from a homogeneous ideal by considering only the generators of a fixed degree. We investigate cases in which the chopped ideal defines the same finite set of points as the original one-dimensional ideal. The complexity of computing these points from the chopped ideal is governed by the Hilbert function and regularity. We conjecture values for these invariants and prove them in many cases. We show that our conjecture is of practical relevance for symmetric tensor decomposition.</description>
