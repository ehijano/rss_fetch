      <title>Spontaneous stochasticity in a 3d Weierstrass-ABC flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic systems are characterised by exponential separation between close-by trajectories, which in particular leads to deterministic unpredictability over an infinite time-window. It is now believed, that such butterfly effect is not fully relevant to account for the type of randomness observed in turbulence. For example, tracers in homogeneous isotropic flows are observed to separate algebraically, following a universal cubic growth, independent from the initial separation. This regime, known as Richardon's regime, suggests that at the level of trajectories, and unlike in chaos theory, randomness may in fact emerge in finite-time. This phenomenon called 'spontaneous stochasticity' originates from the singular nature of the underlying dynamics, and provides a candidate framework for turbulent randomness and transport. While spontaneous stochasticity has been mathematically formalised in simplified turbulence models, a precise and systematic tool for quantifying the various facets of this phenomenon is to this day missing. In particular, it is still unclear whether chaos is important for that behaviour to appear.
  In this paper we introduce a 3d rough flow that can be tuned to present Lagrangian chaos. The flow is inspired by the Weierstrass function and is entitled 'the WABC model'. After analysing its properties, we define what is spontaneous stochasticity in this context. The provided formal definition is then adapted to better suit for numerical analysis. We present the results from Monte-Carlo simulations of Lagrangian particles in this flow. Within the numerical precision, we quantitatively observe the appearance of spontaneous stochasticity in this model. We investigate the influence of noise type and find that the observed spontaneous stochasticity does not depend on the chosen stochastic regularisations.</description>

      <title>Critically slow Hilbert-space ergodicity in quantum morphic drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle is foundational for statistical analyses of complex dynamics. This principle has been challenged by the findings of a previous work [Phys. Rev. X 7, 031034 (2017)], where it was argued that a quantum system driven in time by a certain aperiodic sequence without any explicit symmetries, dubbed the Thue-Morse drive, gives rise to emergent nonergodic steady states which are underpinned by effective conserved quantities. Here, we resolve this apparent tension. We rigorously prove that the Thue-Morse drive achieves a very strong notion of quantum ergodicity in the long-time limit: the time evolution of any initial state uniformly visits every corner of its Hilbert space. On the other hand, we find the dynamics also approximates a Floquet drive for arbitrarily long albeit finite periods of time with no characteristic timescale, resulting in a scale-free ergodic dynamics we call critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity (CS-CHSE). Furthermore, numerical studies reveal that CS-CHSE is not specific to the Thue-Morse drive and is in fact exhibited by many other aperiodic drives derived from morphic sequences, i.e., words derived from repeatedly applying substitution rules on basic characters. Our work presents a new class of dynamics in time-dependent quantum systems where full ergodicity is eventually attained, but only after astronomically long times.</description>

      <title>Order and Chaos in Systems of Coaxial Vortex Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of coaxial vortex pairs in an inviscid flow give rise to complex dynamics, with motions ranging from ordered to chaotic. This complexity arises due to the problem's high nonlinearity and numerous degrees of freedom. We analyze the periodic interactions of two vortex pairs with the same absolute strength moving along the same axis and in the same direction. We derive an explicit formula for the leapfrogging period, considering different initial sizes and horizontal separations, and find excellent quantitative agreement with the numerically computed leapfrogging period. We then extend our study to three coaxial vortex pairs with differing strengths, exploring a broad range of initial geometric configurations, and identify conditions that lead to escape to infinity, periodic or quasi-periodic leapfrogging, and chaotic interactions. We also quantify the occurrence of periodic leapfrogging, revealing that the system transitions to two subsystems when vortex pairs have dissimilar strengths and sizes. By performing a sensitivity analysis using neural networks, we find that the initial horizontal separation between the vortex pairs has the most significant effect on the leapfrogging period.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation with Machine Learning Surrogate Models: A Case Study with FourCastNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data-driven surrogate models for weather forecasting provide accurate short-term predictions but inaccurate and nonphysical long-term forecasts. This paper investigates online weather prediction using machine learning surrogates supplemented with partial and noisy observations. We empirically demonstrate and theoretically justify that, despite the long-time instability of the surrogates and the sparsity of the observations, filtering estimates can remain accurate in the long-time horizon. As a case study, we integrate FourCastNet, a weather surrogate model, within a variational data assimilation framework using partial, noisy ERA5 data. Our results show that filtering estimates remain accurate over a year-long assimilation window and provide effective initial conditions for forecasting tasks, including extreme event prediction.</description>
