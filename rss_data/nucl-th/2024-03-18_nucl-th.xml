      <title>Simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics in the vicinity of a critical endpoint belonging to the universality class of the Ising model. This study is motivated by the challenge of modeling the dynamics of critical fluctuations near a conjectured critical endpoint in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We focus on the interaction of shear modes with a conserved scalar density, which is known as model H. We show that the observed dynamical scaling behavior depends on the correlation length and the shear viscosity of the fluid. As the correlation length is increased or the viscosity is decreased we observe a cross-over from the dynamical exponent of critical diffusion, $z\simeq 4$, to the expected scaling exponent of model H, $z\simeq 3$. We use our method to investigate time-dependent correlation function of non-Gaussian moments $M^n(t)$ of the order parameter. We find that the relaxation time depends in non-trivial manner on the power $n$.</description>

      <title>Systematic shell-model study of structure and isomeric states in $^{204-213}$Bi isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have performed systematic shell-model calculations for Bi isotopes with $A=$ 204-213 using KHH7B and KHM3Y effective interactions. We have reported yrast and non-yrast shell-model states corresponding to the available experimental data. From the comparison with the experimental data, we could assign spin and parity of several unconfirmed states. We have also calculated electromagnetic properties and compared them with the available experimental data and predicted where experimental data are not available. This study also includes a detailed discussion of multiple isomeric states based on computed shell-model configurations and their respective half-lives.</description>

      <title>Probing multi-particle bunching from intermittency analysis in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that intermittency, a self-similar correlation regarding the size of the phase space volume, exhibits sensitivity to particle bunching within a system situated in the two-dimensional cell. Based on recent findings concerning fluctuations in charge particle density observed in central Au + Au collisions at various energies ranging from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV at RHIC/STAR, it is proposed that analyzing intermittency in relativistic heavy-ion collisions could serve as a method to investigate density fluctuations linked to correlation phenomena. Our understanding of particle production mechanisms may be enriched by using intermittency analysis to gain new information contained in them that was previously unavailable.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of the fission fragments in the three-body model of binary fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluated nuclide yields, fragment mass and charge distributions, and averaged total kinetic energy of fission fragments for the neutron-induced fission of 30 actinide nuclei are well described in the new model, which considers the fissioning scission system consisting of two heavy fragments and an alpha-particle between them. The alpha-particle has its origin in the neck nucleons. The yield of fission fragments in the model is linked to the number of states over the barrier of the saddle point, which is between the contacting and well-separated fission fragments. The alpha-particle is fused with the nearest heavy fragment after passing the saddle point, therefore, two final fragments appear during fission. The quadrupole deformations of heavy fragments are taken into account in the model. The fragment yields depend on the heights of corresponding saddle points and the values of the equilibrium quadrupole deformation of fragments.</description>

      <title>Variational calculations of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter with the tensor-optimized Fermi Sphere (TOFS) method: many-body effects and short-range correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of state for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are investigated with the tensor-optimized Fermi Sphere method (TOFS) up to the density $\rho=0.5$~fm$^{-3}$. This method is based on a linked-cluster expansion theorem, and the energy per particle of nuclear matter ($E/A$) is calculated variationally with respect to the correlated nuclear matter wave function. We can study the density dependence of the many-body terms arising from the operator products, which contribute to $E/A$. In order to clarify the relation between the many-body effects and short-range correlation, we take the spin-isospin dependent central {\it NN} interaction with a few GeV repulsion in the inner region. The EOS obtained by the TOFS method is reasonably reproduced, compared with other \textit{ab initio} many-body methods. We found that the many-body terms from the 2-body to 6-body ones) give sizable effects on $E/A$ at higher density, and they play an important role in nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a 2+1 flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio model, we have calculated the curvature coefficients and checked them against available lattice QCD estimations. With the observation that the flavor mixing due to the `t Hooft determinant term significantly affects the $\kappa_{2}^{S}$, we explore the effect of $\mu_{S}$ on the $T-\mu_{B}$ cross-over lines. With the novel determination of negative $\kappa_{2}^{B}$ at large $\mu_{S}$, we advocate the importance of studying the same in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Quark anomalous magnetic moment in an extreme magnetic background from pQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop QCD correction to the photon-quark-antiquark vertex in an extremely strong magnetic background, i.e., one in which $\sqrt{eB}$ is much larger than all other mass scales. We resort to the lowest-Landau level approximation, and consider on-shell fermions. We find that the the total magnetic moment is such that that the anomalous magnetic moment contributes to the electric part $\sim iE_3\sigma_3$, the other contributions to $\boldsymbol{B}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and $i\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}_\perp$ being completely suppressed. We show results for the anomalous magnetic moment of quarks up and down, scaled by their values in the vacuum, as a function of the external magnetic field, considering dressed gluons and a renormalization scale $\mu_\mathrm{\tiny \overline{ MS}}=\sqrt{|eB|}$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of chirality from transverse wobbling in $^{135}$Pr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality is a distinct signature that characterizes triaxial shapes in nuclei. We report the first observation of chirality in the nucleus $^{135}$Pr using a high-statistics Gammasphere experiment with the $^{123}$Sb($^{16}$O,4n)$^{135}$Pr reaction. Two chiral-partner bands with the configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^1\otimes \nu(1h_{11/2})^{-2}$ have been identified in this nucleus. Angular distribution analyses of the $\Delta I = 1$ connecting transitions between the two chiral partners have revealed a dominant dipole character. Quasiparticle triaxial rotor model calculations are in good agreement with the experiment. This is the first time that both signatures of triaxiality--chirality and wobbling--have been observed in the same nucleus.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the excitation of the low-lying $^{181\text{m}}$Ta isomer in optical laser-generated plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation of the $^{181\text{m}}$Ta isomer in the laser-plasma scenario was claimed to have been observed more than two decades ago. However, the reported experimental findings - and the respective high excitation rate - were later questioned as they could not be reproduced theoretically. The controversy has remained open ever since. In this work, we reinvestigate both theoretically and experimentally the $^{181\text{m}}$Ta nuclear excitation in an optical laser-generated plasma. Experimentally we have found no evidence for such an excitation process as consistently predicted by previous and our theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Detecting superfluid transition in the pulsar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the core of a neutron star can be host to various novel phases of matter, from nucleon superfluid phase to exotic high baryon density QCD phases. Different observational signals for such phase transitions have been discussed in the literature. Here, we point out a unique phenomenon associated with phase transition to a superfluid phase, which may be the nucleon superfluid phase or a phase like the CFL phase, allowing for superfluid vortices. In any superfluid phase transition, a random network of vortices forms via the so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which eventually mostly decays away, finally leaving primarily vortices arising from the initial angular momentum of the core. This transient, random vortex network can have a non-zero net angular momentum for the superfluid component, which will generally be oriented in an arbitrary direction. This is in contrast to the final vortices, which arise from initial rotation and hence have the initial angular momentum of the neutron star. The angular momentum of the random vortex network is balanced by an equal and opposite angular momentum in the normal fluid due to the conservation of angular momentum, thereby imparting an arbitrarily oriented angular momentum component to the outer shell of the neutron star. This will affect the pulse timing and pulse profile of a pulsar. These changes in the pulses will decay away in a characteristic manner as the random vortex network decays, obeying specific scaling laws leading to universal features for the detection of superfluid transitions occurring in a pulsar core.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the propagation of nonlinear energy density waves in a nonextensive quark-gluon plasma under the influence of a magnetic field using the reductive perturbation technique. For a nonextensive MIT bag equation of state, we obtain the governing equation for the first order perturbation of the energy density. We observe that an increase in the strength of the magnetic field results in the localization of the waves.</description>

      <title>Isotropization of a longitudinally expanding system of scalar fields in the 2PI formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by isotropization of QCD matter in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions, we consider a system of scalar fields that undergoes a boost invariant longitudinal expansion. We use the framework of the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which is close to the underlying quantum field theory, and resum self-energy corrections up to three loops. The resulting 2PI equations of motion are expressed in terms of the Milne coordinates to account for longitudinal expansion. By solving numerically these equations of motion, we can extract the occupation density and the effective mass generated by in-medium interactions. At the largest values of the coupling considered in this study, we observe the onset of isotropization both in the occupation number and in the momentum dependence of the effective mass.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of the phase state of dense matter is hindered by complications of first-principle nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics. By performing the first consistent general-relativistic calculations of tidal-excited g-mode of neutron stars with a first-order strong interaction phase transition in the high-density core, we demonstrate that gravitational wave signal during binary neutron star inspiral probes their innermost hadron-quark transition and provides potent constraints from present and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Correlation of density fluctuation in a magnetized QCD matter near the critical end point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical correlation of density fluctuation in quark gluon plasma with a critical end point has been investigated within the scope of the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of static ultra-high external magnetic field. The dynamic structure factor of the density fluctuation exhibits three Lorentzian peaks in absence of external magnetic field- a central Rayleigh peak and two Brillouin peaks situated symmetrically on the opposite sides of the Rayleigh peak. The spectral structure displays five peaks in presence of the magnetic field due to the coupling of the magnetic field with the hydrodynamic fields in second-order hydrodynamics. The emergence of the extra peaks is due to the asymmetry in the pressure gradient caused by the external magnetic field in the system. Interestingly, it is observed that near the critical end point, all the Brillouin peaks disappear irrespective of the presence or absence of the external magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: The neutron skin thickness of the benchmark nucleus $^{208}$Pb is crucial for our understanding of the equation of state of nuclear matter. In this paper, we discuss the effect of the neutron skin on the flow ratio observables in the semi-isobaric collisions $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au using iEBE-VISHNU hydrodynamic simulations. Our results suggest that $^{208}$Pb and $^{197}$Au should have the same magnitude of neutron skin thickness to describe the anisotropic flow ratios between the semi-isobaric systems. Our method provides an unconventional way to determine the neutron skin with the existing relativistic heavy ion collision data.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor color superconducting quark stars may not exist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large uncertainties in the determinations of the equation of state of dense stellar matter allow the intriguing possibility that the bulk quark matter in beta equilibrium might be the true ground state of the matter at zero pressure. And quarks will form Cooper pairs very readily since the dominant interaction between quarks is attractive in some channels. As a result, quark matter will generically exhibit color superconductivity, with the favored pairing pattern at intermediately high densities being two-flavor pairing. In the light of several possible candidates for such self-bound quark stars, including the very low-mass central compact object in supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 reported recently, we carry out one field-theoretic model, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, of investigation on the stability of beta-stable two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase of quark matter, nevertheless find no physically-allowed parameter space for the existence of 2SC quark stars.</description>

Abstract: The $V_{lowk}$-renormalization group approach on the surface of Fermi liquid for nuclear matter to which Tom Kuo made a pioneering contribution at Stony Brook is found to inject the pivotal input in the formulation of the generalized nuclear effective field theory with acronym ``G$n$EFT" applicable to superdense compact-star physics. A topology change in terms of skyrmions and half-skyrmions is shown to play the role of the ``putative" hadron-quark continuity (HQC)" conjectured in QCD. Crucially involved are hidden local symmetry (``HLS") and hidden scale symmetry (``HSS") with the vacuum sliding with density in nuclear medium, with the nuclear tensor force emerging as a Landau Fermi-liquid fixed-point quantity. A possibly novel paradigm, a ``Cheshire Catism," in nuclear correlations is suggested.</description>

      <title>Estimating angular momenta of fission fragments from isomeric yield ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To deduce the angular momenta of fission fragments based on the observed isomeric yield ratios (IYR) in 25-MeV proton-induced fission of 238U and to compare these using Wilson's model. Method: A surrogate model of GEF has been developed to generate properties of primary fission fragments. Based on the excitation energy and angular momentum of fission fragments from GEF, an energy versus angular momentum matrix is reconstructed using a set of parameters. With such matrices as input, TALYS is used to calculate the de-excitation of the fission fragments, from which the IYRs are obtained. By varying one of the parameters, the root-mean-square angular momentum (Jrms), which determines the angular momentum distribution of the matrix, Jrms-dependent IYRs are obtained. Considering all primary fission fragments contributing to the IYR for a given fission product, the average angular momentum of those fragments is estimated. Results: Data of 31 IYRs in proton-induced fission of 238U were analysed. As a result, the average Jrms, equivalent to average angular momentum Jav, with uncertainties of 24 fission products, are presented. Considering the neutron emissions of the primary fission fragments, the Jav as a function of the primary fission fragment is presented. A mass dependency of Jav is observed in the proton-induced fission of 238U. Moreover, the Jav for A larger than 131 could be described by the parameterisation proposed by J. Wilson. In general, higher Jav are observed in the present work compared to those from Wilson et al. This is likely due to the higher excitation energy of the fissioning nuclei in this work compared to Wilson's. Furthermore, systematic measurements of the Jav of fission products in the symmetric mass region are presented for the first time. A decreasing trend with mass numbers is observed, which can not be explained by the proposal in Wilson's paper.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-introduce, in light of our modern understanding of neutrinos, the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X\to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the Parton Momentum-Fraction Dependence of Generalized Parton Distributions from Exclusive Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $x$ dependence of hadrons' generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $\mathcal{F}(x,\xi,t)$ is the most difficult to extract from the existing known processes, while the $\xi$ and $t$ dependence are uniquely determined by the kinematics of the scattered hadron. We study the single diffractive hard exclusive processes for extracting GPDs in the photoproduction. We demonstrate quantitatively the enhanced sensitivity on extracting the $x$ dependence of various GPDs from the photoproduction cross sections, as well as the asymmetries constructed from photon polarization and hadron spin that could be measured at JLab Hall D by GlueX Collaboration and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Inverted Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the radial and non-radial oscillations of Cross stars (CrSs), i.e., stars with a quark matter crust and a hadronic matter core in an inverted order compared to conventional hybrid stars. We draw comparisons of their oscillation modes with those of neutron stars, quark stars, and conventional hybrid stars. We find that the stellar stability analysis from the fundamental mode of radial oscillations, and the $g$, $f$ modes of non-radial oscillations are quite similar to those of conventional hybrid stars. However, due to the inverted stellar structure, the first non-radial $p$ mode of CrSs behaves in an inverted way and sits in a higher frequency domain compared to that of conventional hybrid stars. These results provide a direct way to discriminate CrSs from other types of compact stars via gravitational-wave probes. Specifically, compact stars emitting $g$-mode gravitational waves within the $0.5$-$1$ kHz range should be CrSs or conventional hybrid stars rather than neutron stars or pure quark stars, and a further GW detection of the first $p$ mode above 8 kHz or an identification of a decreasing trend of frequencies versus star masses associated with it will help identify the compact object to be a CrS rather than a conventional hybrid star.</description>

Abstract: Based on recent progress in the systematic analysis of $C$ and $CP$ violation in the light-meson sector, we calculate the $C$-odd transition amplitudes $\eta\to\pi^0\ell^+\ell^-$ and $\eta'\to\eta\ell^+\ell^-$. Focusing on long-distance contributions driven by the lowest-lying hadronic intermediate states, we work out the correlations between these beyond-the-Standard-Model signals and the Dalitz-plot asymmetries in $\eta \rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\eta' \rightarrow \eta \pi^+ \pi^- $, using dispersion theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the QCD instanton vacuum model to discuss the emergence of the light scalar and vector mesons on the light front. We take into account both the instanton and anti-instanton single and molecular interactions on the light quarks, in the form of non-local effective interactions. Although the molecular induced interactions are suppressed by a power of the packing fraction, they are still sufficient to bind the vector mesons, while keeping most of the scalar spectrum relatively unchanged. We explicitly derive the light front distribution amplitudes (DAs) and partonic functions (PDFs) for the scalar and vector mesons, and compare them after pertinent QCD evolution, to the available empirical and lattice measured counterparts. The Dirac electric form factors for both the pion and rho meson are derived, and shown to compare well with current data.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Effect on Potential Barrier for Nucleosynthesis II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic fields on the potential barrier between two interacting nuclei. We addressed this by solving the Boltzmann equation and Maxwell's theory in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in the determination of magnetized permittivity. Additionally, we derived the magnetized Debye potential, which combines the conventional Debye potential with an additional magnetic component. We then compared the Boltzmann approach with the Debye method. Both methods consistently demonstrate that magnetic fields increase permittivity. This enhanced permittivity leads to a reduction in the potential barrier, consequently increasing the reaction rate for nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, the dependence on temperature and electron density in each approach is consistent. Our findings suggest that magnetized plasmas, which have existed since the Big Bang, have played a crucial role in nucleosynthesis.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) on the complex plane, which was treated in our previous research, to finite temperature.
  As a simple example, we solve the SDE for a model with four-fermion interactions in the (1+1) space-time dimensions at strong coupling region. We investigate the properties of the effective mass and energy for the fermions, especially near the phase transition point.</description>

      <title>High-precision mass measurements of neutron deficient silver isotopes probe the robustness of the $N$ = 50 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision mass measurements of exotic $^{95-97}$Ag isotopes close to the $N = Z$ line have been conducted with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer, with the silver ions produced using the recently commissioned inductively-heated hot cavity catcher laser ion source at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line facility. The atomic mass of $^{95}$Ag was directly determined for the first time. In addition, the atomic masses of $\beta$-decaying 2$^+$ and 8$^+$ states in $^{96}$Ag have been identified and measured for the first time, and the precision of the $^{97}$Ag mass has been improved. The newly measured masses, with a precision of $\approx$ 1 keV/c$^2$, have been used to investigate the $N =$ 50 neutron shell closure confirming it to be robust. Empirical shell-gap and pairing energies determined with the new ground-state mass data are compared with the state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} calculations with various chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians. The precise determination of the excitation energy of the $^{96m}$Ag isomer in particular serves as a benchmark for \textit{ab initio} predictions of nuclear properties beyond the ground state, specifically for odd-odd nuclei situated in proximity to the proton dripline below $^{100}$Sn. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and configuration-interaction shell-model (CISM) calculations are compared with the experimental results. All theoretical approaches face challenges to reproduce the trend of nuclear ground-state properties in the silver isotopic chain across the $N =$50 neutron shell and toward the proton drip-line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Global Sensitivity Analysis for Monte Carlo radiation transport applications. GSA is usually combined with Uncertainty Quantification, where the latter quantifies the variability of a model output in the presence of uncertain inputs and the former attributes this variability to the inputs. The additional noise inherent to MC RT solvers due to the finite number of particle histories presents an additional challenge to GSA and UQ, which are well-established for deterministic solvers. In this contribution, we apply variance deconvolution to the Saltelli method to address MC RT solver noise without having to over-resolve the MC RT simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>
