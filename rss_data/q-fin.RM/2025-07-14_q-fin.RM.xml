      <title>Multi-Scale Network Dynamics and Systemic Risk: A Model Context Protocol Approach to Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing systemic risk in financial markets through multi-scale network dynamics using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent communication. We develop an integrated approach that combines transfer entropy networks, agent-based modeling, and wavelet decomposition to capture information flows across temporal scales implemented in the MCPFM (Model Context Protocol Financial Markets) R package. Our methodology enables heterogeneous financial agents including high-frequency traders, market makers, institutional investors, and regulators to communicate through structured protocols while maintaining realistic market microstructure. The empirical analysis demonstrates that our multi-scale approach reveals previously hidden systemic risk patterns, with the proposed systemic risk index achieving superior early warning capabilities compared to traditional measures. The framework provides new insights for macroprudential policy design and regulatory intervention strategies. The complete implementation is available as an open-source R package at https://github.com/avishekb9/MCPFM to facilitate reproducible research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Entity-Specific Cyber Risk Assessment using InsurTech Empowered Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research and predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due to the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their reputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective, potential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber incident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to optimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven methods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational features in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a novel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with entity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a multilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident types (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and Others) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual frequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore dependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations are observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML techniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by InsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance prediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only using conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent, entity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and proactive cyber risk mitigation. It provides insurers and organizations with data-driven insights to support decision-making and compliance planning.</description>

      <title>Three-level qualitative classification of financial risks under varying conditions through first passage times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on financial risks from a probabilistic point of view. The value of a firm is described as a geometric Brownian motion and default emerges as a first passage time event. On the technical side, the critical threshold that the value process has to cross to trigger the default is assumed to be an arbitrary continuous function, what constitutes a generalization of the classical Black-Cox model. Such a generality favors modeling a wide range of risk scenarios, including those characterized by strongly time-varying conditions; but at the same time limits the possibility of obtaining closed-form formulae. To avoid this limitation, we implement a qualitative classification of risk into three categories: high, medium, and low. They correspond, respectively, to a finite mean first passage time, to an almost surely finite first passage time with infinite mean, and to a positive probability of survival for all times. This allows for an extensive classification of risk based only on the asymptotic behavior of the default function, which generalizes previously known results that assumed this function to be an exponential. However, even within these mathematical conditions, such a classification is not exhaustive, as a consequence of the behavioral freedom that continuous functions enjoy. Overall, our results contribute to the design of credit risk classifications from analytical principles and, at the same time, constitute a call of attention on potential models of risk assessment in situations largely affected by time evolution.</description>
