      <title>Analysis of the Third Harmonic of a Vacuum Response in a Subcritical Laser Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear response of the physical vacuum by the example of the third harmonic in radiation of the electron-positron-photon plasma excited by a strong time dependent electric field at the focus spot of counterpropagating laser pulses. The investigation was developed within the framework of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon kinetic theory nonperturbatively describing vacuum creation of the quasiparticle electron-positron plasma (EPP) and different channels of its interaction with the photon subsystem in the single-photon approximation that are opened in the presence of a strong semiclassical field. We investigate the radiation of EPP in the annihilation channel on the basis of the well known approximations and compare the obtained result with the semiclassical radiation of the plasma oscillations. In the high-frequency range for large adiabaticity parameter the quantum radiation dominates in comparison with the semiclassical one.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Shifts in Deuterated Methanol Induced by Variation of me/mp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients, Q_mu, of microwave molecular transitions in the ground torsion-rotation state of deuterated methanol (CH3OD, CD3OH, and CD3OD) to small variations in the fundamental physical constant mu = me/mp - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - are reported. Theoretical motivation for changes in mu comes from a variety of models beyond the Standard Model of particle physics which are invoked to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy that dominate the Universe. The calculated values of Q_mu range from -300 to +73 and, thus, make deuterated methanol promising for searches for small space-time changes in mu. It is also shown that among the calculated sensitivity coefficients Q_mu using different Hamiltonians in the present and previous works, there are several pronounced outliers of unclear nature.</description>

      <title>Getting More Out of Black Hole Superradiance: a Statistically Rigorous Approach to Ultralight Boson Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) superradiance can provide strong constraints on the properties of ultralight bosons (ULBs). Since most of the previous work has focused on the theoretical predictions, here we investigate the most suitable statistical framework to constrain ULB masses and self-interactions. We argue that a Bayesian approach provides a clear statistical interpretation, deals with limitations regarding the reproducibility of existing BH analyses, incorporates the full information from BH data, and allows us to include additional nuisance parameters or to perform hierarchical modelling with BH populations in the future. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using mass and spin posterior samples for the X-ray binary BH M33 X-7 and, for the first time in this context, the supermassive BH IRAS 09149-6206. We explain the differences to existing ULB constraints in the literature and illustrate the effects of various assumptions about the superradiance process (equilibrium regime vs cloud collapse, higher occupation levels). As a result, our procedure yields the most rigorous ULB constraints available in the literature, with important implications for the QCD axion and axion-like particles. We encourage all groups analysing BH data to publish likelihood functions or posterior samples as supplementary material to facilitate this type of analysis.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Muons in Laboratories Deep Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide comprehensive calculations of total muon fluxes, energy and angular spectra, and mean muon energies in deep underground laboratories - under flat overburdens and mountains and underwater - using our latest calculation code, MUTE v3. For precise modeling, we compiled rock densities and chemical compositions for various underground labs, as well as topographic map profiles of overburdens, and integrated them into our calculations. Our results show excellent agreement with available data for most underground sites when using the latest surface muon flux model, daemonflux. Moreover, since our calculations do not rely on underground measurements of muons or other secondaries, we can verify the consistency of measurements across different detectors at different sites. MUTE is an open-source, publicly available program, providing a solid framework for accurate muon flux predictions in various underground environments, essential for applications in cosmic ray physics and dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants from photon-photon scattering in three-beam collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the elastic scattering of real photons on an electromagnetic field would allow the fundamental low-energy constants of quantum electrodynamics (QED) to be experimentally determined. We show that scenarios involving the collision of three laser beams have several advantages over conventional two-beam scenarios. The kinematics of a three-beam collision allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the detection region, without the need for polarimetry and separates out contributions from different orders of photon scattering. A planar configuration of colliding a photon beam from an x-ray free electron laser with two optical beams is studied in detail. We show that measurements of elastic photon scattering and vacuum birefringence are possible with currently available technology.</description>

      <title>Smooth reheating and dark matter via non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how a dark sector can provide a crucial link between a vacuum-dominated early universe and the later radiation-dominated epoch. As an example, we consider a feeble axion-like coupling of dark non-Abelian gauge fields with a single inflaton. In this scenario, a dark heat bath emerges at the end of inflation. As the dark sector cools down, its gauge fields confine into composite glueball states. The reheating of the visible sector is realized through portal interactions. After confinement, discrete symmetries protect part of the glueball states that form relic dark matter, while the others keep decaying into Standard Model degrees of freedom. The dark relic abundance depends mostly on the departure from equilibrium dynamics after the phase transition, constraining the confinement scale of the dark sector. Moreover, indirect detection and Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set bounds on the scale of portal interactions. We show that in a narrow but non-vanishing region of the parameter space, the correct dark matter abundance and sufficient reheating temperature are simultaneously reached.</description>

      <title>Gluon shadowing in nuclei and the role of the $c \bar c g$ state in the coherent photoproduction of $J/\psi$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, we confront our results on diffractive photoproduction of $J/\psi$ mesons with the putative gluon shadowing ratio defined as $R_g= \sqrt{\sigma(\gamma A \to J/\psi A)/\sigma_{\rm IA.}}$, where $\sigma_{\rm IA}$ is the result in impulse approximation. Building on our earlier description of the process in the color-dipole approach, where we took into account the rescattering of $c \bar c$ states only, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $c \bar c g$-Fock states improves the description at small $x$ commonly associated with gluon shadowing.</description>

      <title>Hadron-ion collisions in Pythia and the vector-meson dominance model for photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension to the Pythia Monte Carlo event generator that enables simulations of collisions between a generic hadron beam on a nuclear target with energy variation in event-by-event basis. This builds upon Pythia's module for heavy ions, Angantyr, as well as previous work on simulating hadron-proton collisions. As such, the extensions in this work are largely technical, except for a rudimentary model for hadronic fluctuations. With hadron-ion simulations, we implement an explicit vector-meson dominance (VMD) model that can be used to simulate interactions of hadronic component of real photons in photo-nuclear collisions. Such processes can be studied in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions and in the future also with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. Our work also has applications to hadronic showers, e.g. air showers initiated by high-energy cosmic rays. We first validate the VMD model by comparing to HERA photoproduction data on proton target. Then we apply this to generate events for ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and present the results corresponding to the event-selection criteria matching to a recent ATLAS analysis. We find that single-particle multiplicity and rapidity distributions are well in line with the measured ones. We also construct the Fourier coefficients from two-particle correlations for the simulated events and study whether the resulting azimuthal anisotropies are consistent with the ATLAS results.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling limits induced by weak-coupling expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is described for the extrapolation of perturbative expansions in powers of asymptotically small coupling parameters or other variables onto the region of finite variables and even to the variables tending to infinity. The method involves the combination of ideas from renormalization group theory, approximation theory, dynamical theory, and optimal control theory. The extrapolation is realized by means of self-similar factor approximants, whose control parameters can be uniquely defined. The method allows to find the large-variable behavior of sought functions knowing only their small-variable expansions. Convergence and accuracy of the method are illustrated by explicit examples, including the so-called zero-dimensional field theory and anharmonic oscillator. Strong-coupling behavior of Gell-Mann-Low functions in multicomponent field theory, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum chromodynamics is found, being based on their weak-coupling perturbative expansions.</description>

      <title>Multijet event shape variables for Mueller Navelet jet topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new set of multijet event shape variables introduced to further understand the Mueller-Navelet jet topology. This topology consists of having at least one pair of jets with a very large rapidity separation between them, treating additional jet activity inclusively. This multijet topology is expected to shed light on the radiation pattern that is expected in the high-energy limit of the strong interaction. The paper relies on a Monte Carlo event generator analysis. One set of predictions uses the BFKLex event generator, which is based on Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) evolution with a resummation of large logarithms of energy at leading-logarithmic accuracy. The BFKLex predictions are compared with a fixed-order next-to-leading order pQCD calculation using POWHEG matched to the parton shower of PYTHIA8 (NLO+PS), which is the standard for NLO generator predictions at the LHC. We find that both approaches lead to compatible results at current LHC energies, assuming the current experimental constraints for the reconstruction of low transverse momentum jets in ATLAS and CMS. This shows the reliability of the BFKL approach at describing the behavior of the strong interaction in the preasymptotic limit of high center-of-mass energies. Differences between the NLO+PS and the BFKL-based approaches are found when the jet multiplicity is increased or when the minimum transverse momentum of the jets is decreased.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium fragmentation in a variable-flavor number scheme: Towards NRFF1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report progress on the determination and study of quarkonium production within the fragmentation approximation. Our analyses address the moderate and large transverse-momentum regime, where the collinear fragmentation of a single parton is expected to dominate over the short-distance production, directly from the hard scattering, of the constituent $(Q \bar{Q})$ system. Parton fragmentation channels to pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia are built on the basis of non-Relativistic QCD next-to-leading computations, which we use to model initial-scale fragmentation inputs. Thus, a preliminary family of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are constructed through standard DGLAP evolution. Statistical uncertainties are obtained from a Monte Carlo, replica-like approach embodying missing higher-order uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach based on the theory of an axiomatic $S$ matrix and partially switching on an interaction, which is extremely suitable for describing the phenomenon of oscillations within the framework of quantum field theory. We discuss the relation of the proposed approach with other approaches based on considering of wave packets as asymptotic states or introducing of ``distance- or time-dependent propagators''.</description>

      <title>A systematic investigation on dark matter-electron scattering in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the general dark matter-electron interactions within the framework of effective field theories (EFT). We consider both the non-relativistic (NR) EFT and the relativistic EFT descriptions of the interactions with the spin of dark matter (DM) up to one, i.e., the scalar ($\phi$), fermion ($\chi$), and vector $(X)$ DM scenarios. We first collect the leading-order NR EFT operators describing the DM-electron interactions, and construct especially the NR operators for the vector DM case. Next, we consider all possible leading-order relativistic EFT operators including those with a photon field and perform the NR reduction to match them onto the NR EFT. Then we rederive the DM-bound-electron scattering rate within the NR EFT framework and find that the matrix element squared, which is the key input that encodes the DM and atomic information, can be compactly decomposed into three terms. Each term is a product of a DM response function $(a_{0,1,2})$, which is essentially a factor of Wilson coefficients squared, and its corresponding generalized atomic response function ($\widetilde W_{0,1,2}$). Lastly, we employ the electron recoil data from the DM direct detection experiments (including XENON10, XENON1T, and PandaX-4T) to constrain all the non-relativistic and relativistic operators in all three DM scenarios. We set strong bounds on the DM-electron interactions in the sub-GeV region. Particularly, we find that the latest PandaX-4T S2-only data provide stringent constraints on dark matter with a mass greater than approximately 20 MeV, surpassing those from the previous XENON10 and XENON1T experiments.</description>

Abstract: The prospected sensitivity in $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$ determination using an event shape observable, ratio of energy correlators at future electron-positron collider is presented. The study focuses on the collinear region which has suffered from large theoretical and hadronization uncertainty in the past. The ratio effectively reduces the impacts of the uncertainties. With the amount of data that future electron-positron collider could produce in 1 minute (40 $\text{pb}^{-1}$) and 0.5 hour (1 $\text{fb}^{-1}$), a 1% and 0.2% precision of $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$ could be reached.</description>

      <title>The 95GeV Excesses in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric Next-to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses by CMS and ATLAS suggest a deviation in the di-photon channel at approximately 95 GeV, alongside a previously observed excess in $b\bar{b}$ signals at a similar mass by LEP, potentially hinting at a new scalar particle. This study explores this possibility within the framework of the well-established $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. A comprehensive parameter scan was conducted, integrating constraints from dark matter relic density, direct detection experiments, and the properties of the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson. The results demonstrate that the model can accommodate the observed excesses with a singlet-dominated CP-even Higgs boson near 95 GeV. The model accurately predicts signal strengths of the di-photon and $b\bar{b}$ channels at a level of $1\sigma$. Furthermore, it accounts for the measured dark matter relic abundance through Bino-dominated neutralinos co-annihilation with Wino-like electroweakinos, all while remaining consistent with existing LHC constraints. These findings pave the way for future validation at the high-luminosity LHC and linear colliders, which may offer crucial tests of the model's predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the 3-3-1 model with neutral leptons (called the 331$NL$ for short) and by that, we will point out that this model can simultaneously explain the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays of the $Z$ boson $Z \to e_a e_b$, Standard model-like Higgs boson decay $h\to e_be_a$, and the charged leptons $e_b\to e_a \gamma$ consistent with the recent experimental data. In addition, the numerical results show strict relations among these decay rates of $Z$ and $h$ which are predicted by this model. As a result, the decay channels can be determined theoretically if one of them is detected by experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal and non-thermal DM production in non-Standard Cosmologies: a mini review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a short review of some aspects of Dark Matter production in non Standard Cosmology. Considering the simplest Higgs portal model as definite particle physics setup, we consider the impact on the parameter space corresponding to the correct relic density, and the complementary experimental constraints, of the presence, during thermal production, of an exotic component dominating the energy density of the Universe. In the second part of the work we will focus on the case that such exotic component satisfies the equation of state of matter and it can produce DM non-thermally.</description>

      <title>Isospin QCD as a laboratory for dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD with the isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, is a useful laboratory to delineate the microphysics in dense QCD. To study the quark-hadron-continuity we use a quark-meson model that interpolates hadronic and quark matter physics at microscopic level. The equation of state is dominated by mesons at low density but taken over by quarks at high density. We extend our previous studies with two-flavors to the three-flavors case to study the impact of the strangeness which may be brought by kaons $(K_+, K_0) = (u\bar{s}, s\bar{d})$ and the U$_A$(1) anomaly. In the normal phase the excitation energies of kaons are reduced by $\mu_I$ in the same way as hyperons in nuclear matter at finite baryon chemical potential. Once pions condense, kaon excitation energies increases as $\mu_I$ does. Moreover, strange quarks become more massive through the U$_A$(1) coupling to the condensed pions. Hence at zero and low temperature the strange hadrons and quarks are highly suppressed. The previous findings in two-flavor models, sound speed peak, negative trace anomaly, gaps insensitve to $\mu_I$, persist in our three-flavor model and remain consistent with the lattice results to $\mu_I \sim 1$ GeV. We discuss the non-perturbative power corrections and quark saturation effects as important ingredients to understand the crossover equations of state measured on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Proton Decay and Gauge Coupling Unification in an Extended SU(5) GUT with 45-Dimensional Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of an extended SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) that incorporates a 45-dimensional Higgs representation to address the shortcomings of the minimal SU(5) GUT, such as the inability to generate realistic fermion mass hierarchies and insufficient proton stability. By considering a hierarchical mass spectrum for the scalar components of the 45-Higgs, we demonstrate that successful gauge coupling unification (GCU) can be achieved. The color octet scalar, color triplet scalar, and color anti-triplet scalar play crucial roles in realizing GCU when their masses are significantly lighter than other components of the 45-Higgs. We focuses on the proton decay channels mediated by the exchange of the color anti-triplet scalar. Assuming that the 45-Higgs couples to all three generations of fermions, we determine the 45-Higgs Yukawa couplings with which the observed fermion mass matrices at low energies are realized. We calculate proton decay rates using the Yukawa couplings obtained from renormalization group evolutions and matching conditions at the GUT scale, thereby exploring the dependence of proton decay rates on model parameters. We find that the $p \to \nu \pi$ mode imposes the most stringent constraint on the mass of the color anti-triplet scalar $M_{S_1}$. We also study the correlations between the lower bounds on $M_{S_1}$ derived from different proton decay modes.</description>

      <title>On the Metastability of Quantum Fields in Thermal Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the metastability of scalar fields in quantum field theories at finite temperature, focusing on a detailed understanding of the bounce solution. At finite temperature, the bounce solution depends on two variables: the Euclidean time $\tau$ and the spatial radial distance $r$, and it is periodic in the $\tau$ direction. We propose a novel method to determine the bounce that describes transitions in a thermal bath, suitable for numerical calculations. Two types of bounces exist for transitions in the thermal bath: $\tau$-dependent and $\tau$-independent bounces. We apply our method to compute these bounces in several models, including both thin-wall and thick-wall scenarios, to examine their properties. Specifically, we evaluate the critical temperature below which the $\tau$-independent bounce becomes destabilized due to fluctuations, rendering it irrelevant. We demonstrate that in the thick-wall case, the $\tau$-dependent bounce smoothly transitions into the $\tau$-independent one as temperature increases, whereas in the thin-wall case, the transition between the two types of bounces is discontinuous.</description>

      <title>Regularization effects in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model: Strong scheme dependence of inhomogeneous phases and persistence of the moat regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the phase structure of the non-renormalizable (3+1)-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with particular focus on inhomogeneous phases (IPs), where the chiral condensate is non-uniform in space, and the closely related moat regimes, where mesonic dispersion relations favor non-vanishing momenta. We use the mean-field approximation and consider five different regularization schemes including three lattice discretizations. The results within the different regularization schemes are systematically analyzed in order to study the dependence of the IP on the choice of regulatization scheme and regulator value. The IP exhibits a drastic dependence on the chosen regularization scheme rendering any physical interpretation of results on inhomogeneous phases in this model doubtful. In contrast, we find only a mild scheme dependence of the moat regime suggesting that its existence is a consequence of the action of the NJL model and its symmetries and, thus, that it might also exist in QCD.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in ALP effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay is an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the SM in future neutrino experiments with enhanced sensitivity. The dark sector states such as an axion or axion-like particle (ALP) can induce nucleon decays with distinct signature and kinematics from the conventional nucleon decays. In this work, we study the ALP effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light ALP on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-8 BNV operators in the extended EFTs with an ALP field $a$ respecting shift symmetry. The low-energy EFT operators with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ and $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$ are matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian and the BNV interactions between ALP and baryons/mesons. The ALP interactions lead to two-body baryon decays $B\to \ell~({\rm or}~\nu)~a$ and three-body nucleon decays $N\to M~\ell~({\rm or}~\nu)~a$. We obtain the constraints on the UV scale from the invisible $\Lambda^0$ decay search at BESIII, the invisible neutron decay search at KamLAND and proton decay search at Super-K. We also show the projections of some other baryon/nucleon decays and present the distinct distributions of kinematic observable.</description>

      <title>Tri-boson and WH production in the $\mathrm{W}^+\mathrm{W}^+\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}$ channel: predictions at full NLO accuracy and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first full NLO predictions for the process $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu\mathrm{e}^+\nu_\mathrm{e}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}$ at the LHC in a typical tri-boson phase space. The NLO corrections reach 50% at the level of the fiducial cross section and have a very different hierarchy with respect to vector-boson-scattering phase spaces. By comparing the cross section of the full off-shell process with the sum of contributing on-shell electroweak-boson production subchannels, we find that the process is dominated by WWW and WH production, while vector-boson-scattering topologies still play a non-negligible role. In addition, NLO QCD predictions matched to parton shower which are supplemented by approximate electroweak corrections are provided. For the fiducial cross section, the electroweak corrections turn out to be small but the QCD corrections reach 47%. For the inclusive cross section, matching to parton shower affects the predictions by 7%. However, for differential distributions corrections due to the parton shower can be much more sizeable, depending on the region of phase space.</description>

      <title>Helicity Evolution at Small $x$: Quark to Gluon and Gluon to Quark Transition Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We include the quark to gluon and gluon to quark shock-wave transition operators into the small Bjorken-$x$ evolution equations for helicity in the flavor-singlet channel derived earlier. While such transitions do not affect the large-$N_c$ version of the evolution equations for helicity, the large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ equations are affected. ($N_c$ and $N_f$ are the numbers of quark colors and flavors, respectively.) We derive the corresponding corrected large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ equations for the polarized dipole amplitudes contributing to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity distributions in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA), resumming powers of $\alpha_s \, \ln^2 (1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant. We solve these equations iteratively and extract the polarized splitting functions up to four loops. We show that our splitting functions agree with the fixed-order perturbative calculations up to and including the existing three-loops results. Similar to the large-$N_c$ helicity evolution in the shock-wave approach, our large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ small-$x$ splitting functions agree with those obtained in the infrared evolution equations framework up to three loops, but appear to slightly disagree at four loops.</description>

      <title>Modified homotopy approach for diffractive production in the saturation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to develop the homotopy method for solving of the non linear evolution equation for the diffractive production in deep inelastic scattering(DIS). We introduce part of the nonlinear corrections as a first step of this approach. This simplified nonlinear evolution equation is solved analytically taking into account the initial and boundary conditions for the process. At the second step of our approach we demonstrated that the perturbative procedure can be used for the remaining parts of the non-linear corrections. It turns out that these corrections are small and can be estimated in the regular iterative procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers have been studied in great detail, no comprehensive simulation study of the neutron component is available. This is related to the complexity of neutron transport processes that is typically not treated in standard simulation tools. In this work we use the Monte Carlo simulation package Fluka to study the production and the transport of neutrons in extensive air showers over the full range of neutron energies, extending down to thermal neutrons. The importance of different neutron production mechanisms and their impact on predicted neutron distributions in energy, lateral distance, atmospheric depth, and arrival time are discussed. In addition, the dependencies of the predictions on the properties of the primary particle are studied. The results are compared to the equivalent distributions of muons, which serve as reference.</description>

      <title>Particle production in HRG with thermodynamically consistent EoS and partially deformable hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze several strange as well as non-strange relative hadronic yields obtained in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC) experiments over a wide range of centre-of-mass collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). We invoke the formation of a hot and dense hadronic resonance gas (HRG) in the final stage following the URHIC. We use an earlier proposed thermodynamically consistent approach for obtaining the equation of state (EoS) of a hadronic resonance gas (HRG). It takes into account an important aspect of the hadronic interaction, viz., the hadronic hard-core repulsion, by assigning hard-core volumes to the hadrons, leading to an excluded volume (EV) type effect. We have invoked the bag model approach to assign hard-core volumes to baryons (antibaryons) while treating mesons to be point particles. We employ ansatz to obtain the dependence of the temperature and baryon chemical potential of the HRG system on the centre-of-mass energy in the URHIC. We also find strong evidence of double freeze-out scenario, corresponding to baryons (antibaryons) and mesons, respectively. Strangeness (anti-strangeness) imbalance factor is also seen to play an important role in explaining the ratio of strange hadrons to the non-strange ones. The HRG model can explain the experimental data on various relative hadronic multiplicities quite satisfactorily over a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from the lowest RHIC energies to the highest LHC energies for the set of the model parameters obtaining the best theoretical fit to the experimental data by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$/dof value.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scaling of precursor domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks have a large impact on cosmology and present interesting dynamics that can be controlled by various scaling regimes. In the first stage after spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry, the network is seeded with `DW precursors', the zeros of a tachyonic field. At sufficiently weak coupling, this stage can be quite long. The network is then driven to a non-relativistic scaling regime: in flat spacetime the correlation length grows like $L\sim t^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa=1/2$. We focus on the precursor regime in cosmology, assuming a power-law scale factor $a\propto t^\alpha$. We obtain the scaling exponent as a function of the external parameter, $\kappa(\alpha)$, by explicit computation in $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions, and find a smooth transition from nonrelativistic scaling with $\kappa\simeq 1/2$ for $\alpha\lesssim1/2$ to DW gas regime $\kappa \simeq \alpha$ for $\alpha\gtrsim1/2$, confirming previous arguments. The precise form of the transition $\kappa(\alpha)$ is surprisingly independent of dimension, suggesting that similar results should also be valid in $3+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments: Decision Trees versus Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of Dark Matter (DM) remains a significant challenge in particle physics. This study exploits advanced machine learning models to improve detection capabilities of liquid xenon time projection chamber experiments, utilizing state-of-the-art transformers alongside traditional methods like Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate various data representations and find that simplified feature representations, particularly corrected S1 and S2 signals, retain critical information for classification. Our results show that while transformers offer promising performance, simpler models like XGBoost can achieve comparable results with optimal data representations. We also derive exclusion limits in the cross-section versus DM mass parameter space, showing minimal differences between XGBoost and the best performing deep learning models. The comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches provides a valuable reference for future experiments by guiding the choice of models and data representations to maximize detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the quantum properties of ultralight dark matter -- an open quantum systems approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining insight into the constituents of dark matter and their interactions with normal matter has inspired a wide range of experimental efforts. Several approaches, particularly those involving searches for ultralight bosonic dark matter (UBDM) fields, involve the use of quantum systems or measurements performed at the limits imposed by quantum mechanics. While a classical treatment of UBDM and its detectors is satisfactory, a fully quantum description would assist in developing future detection strategies. Here, we present an open quantum systems approach that accomplishes this while providing intuition into the quantum nature of the detection process itself. Furthermore, we apply the quantum theory of optical coherence to characterize the statistical properties of the UBDM field. Using representative examples, we show that this theoretical treatment has implications in uncovering signatures of the cosmological production mechanism of the UBDM field and its galactic merger history. By adapting tools from quantum optics, this work will help facilitate the creation of novel methods to extract astrophysically relevant information from correlation measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated a double-copy relation between inclusive gluon radiation in shock wave collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei and inclusive graviton radiation in trans-Planckian gravitational shock wave collisions. We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>Role of the symmetry energy slope in neutron stars: exploring the model-dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using six different parametrizations of the quantum hadrodynamics (one of which is original), I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope ($L)$ affect some microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the proton fraction, the maximum mass, the radius of the canonical 1.4$M_\odot$ star and its dimensionless tidal parameter $\Lambda$. I show that while most quantities present the same qualitative results, the tidal parameter can increase or decrease with the slope, depending on the model. Moreover, special attention is given to the minimum mass that enables the direct URCA process to occur in neutron stars' interiors ($M_{DU})$. Assuming the weak constraint $M_{DU}~&gt;~1.35M_\odot$, we see that the maximum value of $L$ that satisfies it lies between 79 and 86 MeV. A range of only 7 MeV. Therefore, $M_{DU}$ is an easy way to impose upper bounds to the slope.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

      <title>On bifurcation and spectral instability of asymptotic quasinormal modes in the modified P\"oschl-Teller effective potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The P\"ochl-Teller effective potential mimics an asymptotically de Sitter black hole bounded by an event horizon and a cosmological one. Owing to the benefit of being analytically soluble, the asymptotic quasinormal modes in the modified P\"oschl-Teller potential have been extensively explored in the literature by various authors, and the results bear distinct features. Specifically, for small discontinuities placed at the potential's peak, Skakala and Visser showed that the resulting modes lie primarily along the imaginary frequency axis, in line with the numerical results encountered for most black hole metrics. However, it was also suggested that under ultraviolet perturbations, asymptotic modes are expected to lie parallel to the real axis, closely intervening with recent developments on spectral instability. In this work, by numerical and semi-analytical approaches, we aim to resolve the above apparent ambiguity. The numerical scheme is based on an improved version of the matrix method, which is implemented in compactified hyperboloidal coordinates on the Chebyshev grid. It is demonstrated that both asymptotic behaviors indeed agree with the numerical findings, which is somewhat to one's surprise. Specifically, we report the emergence of a novel branch of purely imaginary modes originating from a bifurcation in the asymptotic quasinormal mode spectrum. Moreover, we demonstrate how the bifurcation and asymptotic modes evolve as the discontinuity moves away from the potential's peak, furnishing a dynamic picture as the spectral instability unfolds. It is further argued that they can be partly attributed to the observed parity-dependent deviations occurring for the low-lying perturbed modes of the original P\"oschl-Teller effective potential.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Interactions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA: from Constructive and BCFW to KLT formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the couplings of the gravity supermultiplet (graviton and gravitino) of minimal $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA following a constructive approach. Firstly, we use the master formulae that follows from considering the scaling behavior of the spinor variables under the little group. Secondly, we derive the 4-point couplings using BFCW. Then, we verify these results for the general 3-point interactions that can be derived using the KLT-type relations, i.e., they can be written as the square of the coupling of the gluons and gluinos. Finally, we consider SUGRA Compton effect for graviton-gravitino. For completeness, we present in the appendix the $\mathcal{N}=1$ Sugra lagrangian in the 2-component Weyl formalism, including the proofs of SUSY and gauge invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution of the nonlinear boson diffusion equation (NBDE) is presented. It accounts for the time evolution towards the Bose-Einstein equilibrium distribution through inelastic and elastic collisions in case of constant transport coefficients. As a currently interesting application, gluon scattering in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is investigated. An estimate of time-dependent gluon-condensate formation in overoccupied systems through number-conserving elastic scatterings in Pb-Pb collisions at relativistic energies is given.</description>

Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the $\Upsilon$-, $\eta_b$- and $B_c$-nucleus systems in momentum space to calculate the bound-state energies and the corresponding coordinate space radial wave functions. A comparison is made among different methods to obtain the partial wave decomposition of meson-nucleus potentials in momentum space, namely, (i) the spherical Bessel transform of the numerically obtained original potential in coordinate space, (ii) the partial wave decomposition of the Fourier transform of the Woods-Saxon approximated form for the original potential, and (iii) the spherical Bessel transform of the Woods-Saxon approximation of the numerically obtained original potential. The strong nuclear bound-state energies for the $\Upsilon$-$^{4}$He, $\Upsilon$-$^{12}$C, $\eta_b$-$^{4}$He, $\eta_b$-$^{12}$C, $B_c$-$^{4}$He (no Coulomb), and $B_c$-$^{12}$C (no Coulomb) systems and the corresponding wave functions in coordinate space are compared for the three methods. Furthermore, as an initial and realistic study, the $B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C bound states are studied for the first time, with the effects of self-consistently calculated Coulomb potentials in $^{12}$C (when the $B_c^{\pm}$ mesons are absent).</description>

      <title>Investigating the excitation function of HBT radii for L\'evy-stable sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main goals of today's heavy-ion physics research is to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and search for signs of the possible critical endpoint on the QCD phase diagram. Femtoscopy is among the important tools used for this endeavor; there have been indications that combinations of femtoscopic radii parameters (referred to as HBT radii for identical boson pairs) can be related to the system's emission duration. An apparent non-monotonic behavior in their excitation function thus might signal the location of the critical point. In this paper, we show that conclusions drawn from the results obtained with a Gaussian approximation for the pion source shape might be altered if one utilizes a more general L\'evy-stable source description. We find that the characteristic size of the pion source function is strongly connected to the shape of the source and its possible power-law behavior. Taking this into account properly changes the observed behavior of the excitation function.</description>

Abstract: A short review of expansion by regions is presented. It is a well-known strategy to obtain an expansion of a given multiloop Feynman integral in a given limit where some kinematic invariants and/or masses have certain scaling measured in powers of a given small parameter. Prescriptions of this strategy are formulated in a simple geometrical language and are illustrated through simple examples.</description>

      <title>Holographic spectral function of fermion in instantonic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we investigate the fermionic correlation function in the D(-1)-D3 brane system which describes the instantonic plasma in holography. In this system, the charge of the D(-1) brane as the D-instanton gives the gluon condensate. To simplify the holographic setup, we first reduce briefly the ten-dimensional supergravity background produced by D(-1)-D3-branes to an equivalently five-dimensional background. Then using the standard method for computing the Green function in the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive the equations for the fermionic correlation functions and solve them numerically with the infalling boundary condition. Our numerical results illustrate that the fermionic correlation function as spectral function includes two branches of the dispersion curves whose behavior is very close to the results obtained from the method of hard thermal loop. And the effective mass generated by the medium effect of fermion splits into two values due to the spin-dependent interactions induced by instantons. Therefore, this work in holography demonstrates the instantonic configuration is very influential to the fermionic plasmino in plasma.</description>

Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional version of the equation of state (EoS) model NEOS, NEOS-4D, as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials of baryon, electric charge, and strangeness for the hot and dense QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. This EoS enables multiple conserved charge current evolution in a relativistic fluid. Input from Lattice QCD simulations and a hadron resonance gas model is considered for constructing the equation of state. We investigate its applicability to the relativistic hydrodynamic description of nuclear collisions and present a method for efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>A search for the fine-structure constant evolution from fast radio bursts and type Ia supernovae data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for a space-time variation of the fundamental constants has been explored over the years to test our physical theories. In this paper, we use the dispersion measure ($DM$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) combined with type Ia supernovae (SNe) data to investigate a possible redshift evolution of the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$), considering the runaway dilaton scenario, which predicts $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} = - \gamma\ln{(1+z)}$, where $\gamma$ is a constant proportional to the current value of the coupling between the dilaton field and hadronic matter. We derive all the relevant expressions for the $DM$ dependence concerning the fine-structure constant and constrain the parameter $\gamma$ from measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the constraining power of larger samples of FRB measurements for data sets with $N = 500$ and $N = 1000$ points. We found that the uncertainty on $\gamma$ can be improved by one order of magnitude and that limits on $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha}$ beyond $\sigma \sim 10^{-2}$ will depend crucially on better control of statistical and systematic uncertainties of upcoming FRB data.</description>

Abstract: We study detection prospects of a gravitational-wave background (GWB) sourced by SU(2) gauge fields considering all possible observational constraints. More precisely, we consider bounds set by cosmic microwave background measurements, primordial black hole overproduction, as well as backreaction of the gauge fields on the background evolution. Gravitational-waves data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration show no evidence for a GWB contribution from axion inflation. However, we are able to place conservative constraints on the parameters of the SU(2) inflation with current data. We investigate conditions on the inflationary potential that would lead to a detectable signal that evades astrophysical and cosmological constraints and discuss detection prospects for third generation networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a bino-like light neutralino ($\tilde \chi_1^0$) produced at the LHC from the decay of a scalar lepton ($\tilde e_L$) through the process $pp\to \tilde e_{L} \to e\tilde \chi_1^0$ in the context of R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetry where $\tilde \chi_1^0$ is the lightest supersymmetric particle. For small masses and RPV couplings, the neutralino is naturally long-lived and its decay products can be identified as displaced tracks. Following existing searches, we propose a displaced-vertex search strategy for such a light neutralino with a single RPV coupling switched on, $\lambda'_{111}$, in the mass range $10\,\mbox{GeV} \lesssim m_{\tilde \chi_1^0}\lesssim 230\,\mbox{GeV}$. We perform Monte Carlo simulations and conclude that at the high-luminosity LHC, the proposed search can probe values of $\lambda'_{111}$ down to two orders of magnitude smaller than current bounds and up to 40 times stronger than projected limits from monolepton searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trilinear Higgs coupling $\lambda_{hhh}$ of the detected Higgs boson is an important probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. Correspondingly, improving the precision of the theoretical predictions for this coupling as well as the experimental constraints on it are among the main goals of particle physics in the near future. In this article, we present the public $\mathtt{Python}$ code $\mathtt{anyH3}$, which provides precise theoretical predictions for $\lambda_{hhh}$. The program can easily be used for any renormalisable model, where for the input the $\mathtt{UFO}$ format is adopted. It allows including corrections up to the full one-loop level with arbitrary values of the external squared momenta and features a semi-automatic and highly flexible renormalisation procedure. The code is validated against known results in the literature. Moreover, we present new results for $\lambda_{hhh}$ in models which so far have not been investigated in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP-odd Higgs couplings to bottom and charm quarks arise in many extensions of the standard model and are of potential interest for electroweak baryogenesis. These couplings induce a contribution to the electron EDM. The experimental limit on the latter then leads to a strong bound on the CP-odd Higgs couplings. We point out that this bound receives large QCD corrections, even though it arises from a leptonic observable. We calculate the contribution of CP-odd Higgs couplings to the bottom and charm quarks in renormalisation-group improved perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the strong interaction, thereby reducing the uncertainty to a few percent.</description>

The constraints on the parameter space for dark photons arising from these electroweak precision observables are then evaluated for both values of the W boson mass. We also extend previous work by placing the first electroweak precision observable constraints on the coupling of dark photons to the fermionic dark matter sector.</description>

Abstract: We consider light-fermion three-loop corrections to $gg\to HH$ using forward scattering kinematics in the limit of a vanishing Higgs boson mass, which covers a large part of the physical phase space. We compute the form factors and discuss the technical challenges. The approach outlined in this letter can be used to obtain the full virtual corrections to $gg\to HH$ at next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Violation of C/CP Symmetry Induced by a Scalar Field Emerging from a Two-Brane Universe: A Gateway to Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model of baryogenesis is introduced where our usual visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk. The visible matter and antimatter sectors are naturally coupled with the hidden matter and antimatter sectors, breaking the C/CP invariance and leading to baryogenesis occurring after the quark-gluon era. The issue of leptogenesis is also discussed. The symmetry breaking spontaneously occurs due to the presence of an extra scalar field supported by the $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ gauge group, which extends the conventional electromagnetic gauge field in the two-brane universe. Observational consequences are discussed.</description>

      <title>$D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $B_{s0}^*$ as molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical generation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $B_{s0}^*$ mesons using a meson-exchange model with a coupled-channelformalism. Our primary focus is on the $D_s^+\pi^0$ channel below the $DK$ threshold. First, we construct the invariant kernel amplitudes, incorporating effective Lagrangians based on heavy-quark symmetry, flavor SU(3) symmetry, and hidden local symmetry. Since the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ state implies isospin symmetry breaking, we introduce $\pi^0-\eta$ isospin mixing. We subsequently solve the coupled-channel integral equations, which include four different channels, i.e., $D_s^+\pi^0$, $D^0 K^+$, $D^+ K^0$, and $D_s^+\eta$. We carefully analyze how the pole corresponding to the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ state emerges from the coupled channels. Our findings reveal that the pole positions of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson are at $\sqrt{s_R}=(2317.9 - i 0.0593)$ MeV and the $\bar{B}_{s0}^*$ meson at $(5756.43-i0.0215)$ MeV, respectively. We also discuss their decay widths and destructive interference of the two sources. In conclusion, our current results provide a clear indication supporting the interpretation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson as a $DK$ molecular state within the present coupled-channel formalism. In addition, we discuss a possible existence of $\bar{B}_{s0}^{*}$.</description>

      <title>Traversing a kinetic pole during inflation: primordial black holes and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inflationary kinetic function with an integrable pole that is traversed during inflation. This scenario leads to enhanced spectra of primordial scalar inhomogeneities with detectable signals: formation of primordial black holes (that could explain Dark Matter) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (that could reproduce the recent Pulsar Timing Array observation, or predict signals in future detectors such as LISA or ET). Spectral signatures depend on whether the inflaton mass dimension at the pole is above or below 2. Values mildly below 2 allow a big power spectrum enhancement with a mild tuning. Finally, we discuss the possibility that a kinetic pole can arise as anomalous dimension of the inflaton due to quantum effects of Planckian particles that become light at some specific inflaton field value.</description>

      <title>Study of a cubic cavity resonator for gravitational waves detection in the microwave frequency range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of frequencies above MHz has recently received considerable attention. In this work we present a precise study of the reach of a cubic cavity resonator to GWs in the microwave range, using for the first time tools allowing to perform realistic simulations. Concretely, the BI-RME 3D method, which allows us to obtain not only the detected power but also the detected voltage (magnitude and phase), is used here. After analyzing three cubic cavities for different frequencies and working simultaneously with three different degenerate modes at each cavity, we conclude that the sensitivity of the experiment is strongly dependent on the polarization and incidence angle of the GW. The presented experiment can reach sensitivities up to $ 1 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 100\, MHz, $ 2 \cdot 10^{-20}$ at 1\, GHz, and $ 6 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 10\, GHz for optimal angles and polarizations, and where in all cases we assumed an integration time of $\Delta t = 1$ ms. These results provide a strong case for further developing the use of cavities to detect GWs. Moreover, the possibility of analyzing the detected voltage (magnitude and phase) opens a new interferometric detection scheme based on the combination of the detected signals from multiple cavities.</description>

      <title>Charge-breaking domain walls separating neutral vacua in multi-Higgs models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalar potential of a multi-Higgs model can possess a rich structure of minima and saddle points, which evolves in an intricate way as the parameters change. In the hot early Universe, it could trigger multi-step phase transitions, with exotic intermediate phases and peculiar domain wall configurations. Here, we provide a glimpse into this richness with the example of the three-Higgs-doublet model with the symmetry group $\Sigma(36)$, either exact or softly broken. We present its phase diagram tracking not only the global minimum but all of its extrema. In particular, we reveal parameter space regions in which the deepest saddle point is charge breaking. This naturally leads to phase transitions between neutral vacua which involve expanding and colliding charge-breaking bubble walls. We also comment on opportunities of multi-step phase transitions, on charge-breaking intermediate phases, and on phase transitions between different charge-breaking vacua. We illustrate the general discussion with two benchmark models, one of which possesses competing saddle points and allows for emergence of bubbles of the same true vacuum but with bubble walls of different nature. The intriguing cosmological implications of all these possibilities deserve dedicated study.</description>

      <title>The possible $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{D}^*$ bound and resonance states by solving Schrodinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schrodinger equation with a Yukawa type of potential is solved analytically. When different boundary conditions are taken into account, a series of solutions are indicated as Bessel function, the first kind of Hankel function and the second kind of Hankel function, respectively. Subsequently, the scattering processes of $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{ D}^*$ are investigated. In the $K \bar{K}^*$ sector, the $f_1(1285)$ particle is treated as a $K \bar{K}^*$ bound state, therefore, the coupling constant in the $K \bar{K}^*$ Yukawa potential can be fixed according to the binding energy of the $f_1(1285)$ particle. Consequently, a $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state is generated by solving the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave condition, which lie at $1417-i18$MeV on the complex energy plane. It is reasonable to assume that the $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state at $1417-i18$MeV might correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of Particle Data Group(PDG).In the $D \bar{D}^*$ sector, since the $X(3872)$ particle is almost located at the $D \bar{ D}^*$ threshold, the binding energy of it equals to zero approximately. Therefore, the coupling constant in the $D \bar{ D}^*$ Yukawa potential is determined, which is related to the first zero point of the zero order Bessel function. Similarly to the $K \bar{K}^*$ case, four resonance states are produced as solutions of the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave condition. It is assumed that the resonance states at $3885-i1$MeV, $4029-i108$ MeV, $4328-i191$MeV and $4772-i267$MeV might be associated with the $Zc(3900)$, the $X(3940)$, the $\chi_{c1}(4274)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4685)$ particles, respectively. It is noted that all solutions are isospin degenerate.</description>

Abstract: To shed light on the nature of the controversial and not yet fully understood exotic states, we are carrying out a systematic study of their electromagnetic properties. The magnetic moment of a hadron state is as fundamental a dynamical quantity as its mass and contains valuable information on the deep underlying structure. In this study, we use the QCD light-cone sum rule to extract the magnetic moments of the $\mathrm{P_{c}(4312)}$, $\mathrm{P_{c}(4380)}$, and $\mathrm{P_{c}(4440)}$ pentaquarks by considering them as the molecular picture with spin-parity $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{1}{2}^-}$, $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, and $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, respectively. We define the isospin of the interpolating currents of these states, which is the key to solving the puzzle of the hidden-charm pentaquark states, to make these analyses more precise and reliable. We have compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for the interpretation of the hidden-charm pentaquark sector, and we observe that they are not in mutual agreement with each other. We have also calculated higher multipole moments for spin-3/2 $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks, indicating a non-spherical charge distribution.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Axion Domain Wall Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion can solve the Strong CP Problem and be the dark matter of our universe. If the PQ symmetry breaking scale associated with the axion is below the inflationary reheating temperature, axion strings and domain walls populate the universe. Most of these strings and walls decay away into axion dark matter, but a small subset of the walls will be self-enclosed surfaces that are not attached to any strings. These enclosed walls can collapse in on themselves, compressing a large amount of energy into a small volume and potentially forming primordial black holes (PBHs). We study the number density and dynamics of these self-enclosed walls, taking into account their size distribution, Hubble expansion, asphericities, and all stages of domain wall dynamics using a combination of semi-analytic and numerical approaches. We find that axion models with a high axion decay constant $f_a$, such as those of interest in early matter-dominated cosmologies, yield a PBH abundance potentially observable by future gravitational lensing surveys. We note that the formalism developed here is also useful for predicting relic PBH abundances in other models that exhibit unstable domain walls.</description>

Abstract: The Primakoff process plays a crucial role in axion production in astrophysical environments and laboratories. Given the rising interest in axion physics and many on-going experimental activities, we conduct a comprehensive calculation of this process and carefully examine several aspects that have been neglected in the literature. In particular, our calculation is valid for axions with significantly large masses, which would be of importance to axion searches utilizing crystal and liquid xenon detectors. We present the most updated calculation of the Primakoff solar axion flux, with a simple parametrization that is applicable to a broad range of axion masses up to a few tens of keV. Our code is publicly available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Energy loss of a heavy fermion in a collisional QED plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the energy loss of heavy fermions moving in a plasma, taking into account the modification of the photon collective modes induced by collisions using a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collisional kernel. We include contributions from both hard and soft scatterings of the heavy fermion using a collisionally modified hard-thermal-loop resummed propagator. Using this method, one does not need to introduce a separation scale between hard- and soft-momentum exchanges. To place our calculation in context, we review other theoretical approaches to computing the collisional energy loss of fermions and discuss the systematics and results obtained in each approach compared to using a resummed propagator for both hard and soft momentum exchanges. Our final results indicate that self-consistently including the effect of collisions in the self-energies of the resummed propagator results in an increased energy loss compared to using collisionless hard-thermal-loop propagators. The effect becomes larger as the magnitude of the coupling constant and the velocity of the fermion increase.</description>

      <title>A Complete Set of 4-Point Amplitudes in the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete set of 4-point amplitudes in the constructive Standard Model at tree level. Any 4-point amplitude can be obtained from the results presented here by a suitable choice of masses, a permutation of the particles (by crossing symmetry), and a reversal of the momenta of the outgoing particles. We have validated all of these amplitudes by comparing with Feynman diagrams for a variety of masses, scattering energy and angles, and helicities of the photons and gluons, when they are in the initial states. The standard constructive techniques work for these amplitudes without the need for any contact terms and indeed, contact terms are not allowed. Only three 4-point vertices are used (allowed), involving the Higgs boson and the W and Z bosons. When external photons or gluons are present, the amplitude simplifies to a single spinor-product structure, present in the numerator. In a few cases, however, the propagator structure is more complex, with different terms depending on the charge or color structure. In the case of internal photons or gluons, we find that the massless limit of a massive photon or gluon diagram gives the correct result in all cases. We have additionally found that using the $x$ factor directly gives the correct result in all cases and agrees with the massless limit calculation.</description>

Abstract: We present an improved calculation of the light element abundances in the framework of Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$. We compare the methods of our calculation to previous literature including the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The PDG result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $-0.014 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.026$, for deuterium we find the constraint $-0.005 \leq \delta v / v \leq -0.001$. These bounds are more stringent than what was found earlier.</description>

      <title>Cosmologically Consistent Analysis of Gravitational Waves from hidden sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Production of gravitational waves in the early universe is discussed in a cosmologically consistent analysis within a first order phase transition involving a hidden sector feebly coupled with the visible sector. Each sector resides in its own heat bath leading to a potential dependent on two temperatures, and on two fields: one a standard model Higgs and the other a scalar arising from a hidden sector $U(1)$ gauge theory. A synchronous evolution of the hidden and visible sector temperatures is carried out from the reheat temperature down to the electroweak scale.The hydrodynamics of two-field phase transitions, one for the visible and the other for the hidden is discussed, which leads to separate tunneling temperatures, and different sound speeds for the two sectors. Gravitational waves emerging from the two sectors are computed and their imprint on the measured gravitational wave power spectrum vs frequency is analyzed in terms of bubble nucleation signature, i.e., detonation, deflagration, and hybrid. It is shown that the two-field model predicts gravitational waves accessible at several proposed gravitational wave detectors: LISA, DECIGO, BBO, Taiji and their discovery would probe specific regions of the hidden sector parameter space and may also shed light on the nature of bubble nucleation in the early universe. The analysis presented here indicates that the cosmologically preferred models are those where the tunneling in the visible sector precedes the tunneling in the hidden sector and the sound speed $c_s$ lies below its maximum, i.e., $c^2_s&lt;\frac{1}{3}$. It is of interest to investigate if these features are universal and applicable to a wider class of cosmologically consistent models.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the mechanism of production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field. We analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-) $pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation and compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' momentum spectra of the created particles at any instant. We observe a multi-profile structure in the LMS. This multi-profile structure clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with pair production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. We highlight that this quantum signature is a universal behavior seen in the momentum spectra at finite times, where the electric field is nearly zero.</description>

      <title>Explaining the possible 95 GeV excesses in the $B-L$ symmetric SSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the excesses observed in the diphoton and $b\bar b$ data around $95\;{\rm GeV}$ within the framework of the $B-L$ supersymmetric model (B-LSSM). Comparing with the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the B-LSSM incorporates two singlet chiral Higgs bosons which mix with the SM-like Higgs boson due to the gauge kinetic mixing effect. The richer Higgs sector indicates that designating the B-LSSM specific CP-even Higgs state as the lightest Higgs boson has great potential to explain the excesses at around $95\;{\rm GeV}$. Considering the two-loop effective potential corrections to the squared Higgs mass matrix, it is found that the signal strengthes $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$, $\mu(h_{95})_{b b}$ can be described simultaneously in the experimental $1\sigma$ interval. And the B-LSSM specific parameters $\tan\beta'$, $B_\eta$, $g_{YB}$, $M_{Z'}$ affect the theoretical predictions on the light Higgs boson masses and signal strengthes $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$, $\mu(h_{95})_{bb}$ significantly.</description>

      <title>Using $\Lambda_b^0(6146)$ and $\Lambda_b^0(6152)$ as probes to investigate possible $\bar{B}^{*}N$ and $D^{*}N$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy quark symmetry can help us identify the internal structure of hadrons and predict new particles. In this study, we examine the strong decay modes of the observed $\Lambda_b^0(6146)$ and $\Lambda_b^0(6152)$, assuming these two states are molecular states primarily composed of $\bar{B}^{*}N$ component. The partial decay widths of the $\bar{B}^{*}N$ molecular state into the $\pi\Sigma_b$ and $\pi\Sigma_b^{*}$ final states through hadronic loops are calculated using effective Lagrangians. Our results, when compared with LHCb observations, support the interpretation of $\Lambda_b^0(6146)$ as a molecule primarily composed of $\bar{B}^{*}N$ components. However, the decay width of $\Lambda_b^0(6152)$ cannot be accurately reproduced within the molecular state framework. Based on the above results and heavy quark symmetry, we predict the existence of $\bar{B}^{*}N$ molecular states with $J^p=5/2^{+}$, which are the heavy quark spin symmetry partners of $\Lambda_b(6146)$, with masses in the range of 6195-6200 MeV. And the main decay is $\pi\Sigma_b^{*}$ channel. Moreover, there must existence of a $D^{*}N$ molecule with $J^p=3/2^{+}$, possible corresponding to the experimentally observed $\Lambda_c(2860)^{+}$. If $\Lambda_c(2880)^{+}$ is indeed the heavy quark flavor symmetry partner of $\Lambda_b(6152)$, it would exhibit a conventional three-quark structure. Therefore, we also propose the search for a $D^{*}N$ molecule with a spin-parity of $J^p=5/2^{+}$, which would be the heavy-quark spin partner state of $\Lambda_c(2860)^{+}$. It should be noted that these baryons may be mixed states, containing both molecular and three-quark components. These results can aid experiments in exploring the internal structure of these baryons.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor in $\Phi^4$ theory at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor form factors are studied in $\Phi^4$ theory to one-loop order with particular focus on the $D$-term, a particle property which has attracted a lot of attention in the recent literature. It is shown that the free Klein-Gordon theory value of the $D$-term $D_{\text{free}}=-1$ is reduced to $D_{\text{one-loop}} =-\frac13$ even if the $\Phi^4$ interaction is infinitesimally small. A companion work in $\Phi^3$ theory confirms this result which may indicate that it is independent of the type of interaction as long as the scalar theory is renormalizable. Dispersion relations are studied. Various definitions of mean square radii including the mechanical radius are investigated. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the EMT properties of particles and their interpretation.</description>

      <title>Steady state, displacement current and spin polarization for massless fermion in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider spin polarization of massless fermions in a shear flow, whose complete contributions contain magnetization current and side-jump current known from collisional chiral kinetic theory. We argue that the side-jump current adopts interpretation of displacement current. We explicitly determine the displacement current contribution in the steady state reached in shear flow for a QED plasma. We find the displacement contribution enhances the magnetization contribution at small and large momenta, but leads to a suppression effect at intermediate momenta. Major differences from previous studies on collisional effect are: (i) the fermions are in the same steady state as the medium rather than being probes; (ii) Compton scattering and pair annihilation are also included in addition to the Coulomb scattering considered before.</description>

      <title>Background Modeling for Double Higgs Boson Production: Density Ratios and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of data-driven background estimation, arising in the search of physics signals predicted by the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Our work is motivated by the search for the production of pairs of Higgs bosons decaying into four bottom quarks. A number of other physical processes, known as background, also share the same final state. The data arising in this problem is therefore a mixture of unlabeled background and signal events, and the primary aim of the analysis is to determine whether the proportion of unlabeled signal events is nonzero. A challenging but necessary first step is to estimate the distribution of background events. Past work in this area has determined regions of the space of collider events where signal is unlikely to appear, and where the background distribution is therefore identifiable. The background distribution can be estimated in these regions, and extrapolated into the region of primary interest using transfer learning with a multivariate classifier. We build upon this existing approach in two ways. First, we revisit this method by developing a customized residual neural network which is tailored to the structure and symmetries of collider data. Second, we develop a new method for background estimation, based on the optimal transport problem, which relies on modeling assumptions distinct from earlier work. These two methods can serve as cross-checks for each other in particle physics analyses, due to the complementarity of their underlying assumptions. We compare their performance on simulated double Higgs boson data.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dark Matter Capture Rate in a Local Population of Brown Dwarfs with IceCube Gen 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential for dark matter annihilation within brown dwarfs, investigating an unconventional mechanism for neutrino production. Motivated by the efficient accumulation of dark matter particles in brown dwarfs through scattering interactions, we focus on a mass range above 10 GeV, considering dark matter annihilation channels $\chi \chi \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu} \nu \bar{\nu}$ through long-lived mediators. Using the projected sensitivity of IceCube Generation 2, we assess the detection capability of the local population of brown dwarfs within 20 pc and exclude dark matter-nucleon scattering with cross-sections as low as a few multiples of $10^{-36}~\rm cm^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Lattice $B$-field correlators for heavy quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the color-magnetic (or "$B$") field two-point function that encodes the finite-mass correction to the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient. The simulations are done on fine isotropic lattices in the quenched approximation at $1.5\,T_c$, using a range of gradient flow times for noise suppression and operator renormalization. The continuum extrapolation is performed at fixed flow time followed by a second extrapolation to zero flow time. Perturbative calculations to next-to-leading order of this correlation function, matching gradient-flowed correlators to MS-bar, are used to resolve nontrivial renormalization issues. We perform a spectral reconstruction based on perturbative model fits to estimate the coefficient $\kappa_B$ of the finite-mass correction to the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient. The approach we present here yields high-precision data for the correlator with all renormalization issues incorporated at next-to-leading order, and is also applicable for actions with dynamical fermions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a cyclic Universe: resilience through cycles and vacuum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalised calculation for the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations in a cyclic Universe, making no assumptions about the vacuum state of the theory and accounting for the contribution of tensor modes produced in the dark energy phase of the previous cycle. We show that these modes have minimal impact on the spectrum observed in the current cycle, except for corrections on scales as large as the comoving Hubble radius today. These corrections are due to sub-horizon modes produced towards the end of the dark energy phase, persisting into the ekpyrotic phase of the next cycle as additional quanta. In relation to the vacuum state, we argue that non-Bunch-Davies quanta can easily overwhelm the energy density driving the dark energy phase, potentially compromising the model. Therefore, avoiding backreaction effects sets restrictive constraints on deviations away from the Bunch-Davies vacuum during this phase, limiting the overall freedom to consider alternative vacua in the cyclic Universe.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Study of charged Lepton Flavor Violation in electron muon interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the improvement of muon acceleration technology, it has received great interest to exploit high-energy muon beams for collision or target experiments. We investigate possible charged Lepton Flavor Violation (cLFV) processes mediated by an extra massive neutral gauge boson Zprime in electron muon interactions, either at a proposed electron muon collider or in a fixed target experiment with high-energy muon beam hitting electrons in the target. Based on Monte Carlo calculations and fast detector simulations, we study in detail our signal and possible backgrounds, giving the sensitivity results of cLFV signals at the 90% confidence level. Compared with current and prospective limits set by other experiments, electron muon interactions demonstrate significant advantages in the cLFV coupling strength sensitivity with tau in the final states. In addition, a special cLFV coupling combination, lambda_emu * lambda_mumu, can also be probed in our proposal.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Model Proposal for Quantum Gravity and the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by large $N$ noncommutative geometry as a model for quantum gravity. The theory admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in our theory. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on the product of the black holes masses and the Newton constant exactly as in Newton gravity. To extract the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, a resummation of all the large $N$ corrections is needed. We outline how Newton gravity for static sources may be reproduced in the long distance limit. We also show that the interaction energy is generally finite in the short distance limit, suggesting that the black hole singularity in general relativity is removed in our quantum description of black hole.</description>
