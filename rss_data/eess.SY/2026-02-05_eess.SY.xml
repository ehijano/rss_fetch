      <title>C-IDS: Solving Contextual POMDP via Information-Directed Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the policy synthesis problem in contextual partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs), where the environment is governed by an unknown latent context that induces distinct POMDP dynamics. Our goal is to design a policy that simultaneously maximizes cumulative return and actively reduces uncertainty about the underlying context. We introduce an information-directed objective that augments reward maximization with mutual information between the latent context and the agent's observations. We develop the C-IDS algorithm to synthesize policies that maximize the information-directed objective. We show that the objective can be interpreted as a Lagrangian relaxation of the linear information ratio and prove that the temperature parameter is an upper bound on the information ratio. Based on this characterization, we establish a sublinear Bayesian regret bound over K episodes. We evaluate our approach on a continuous Light-Dark environment and show that it consistently outperforms standard POMDP solvers that treat the unknown context as a latent state variable, achieving faster context identification and higher returns.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Reinforcement Learning with Viability-Based Action Shielding for Hypersonic Longitudinal Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a safety-critical reinforcement learning framework for nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and input spaces operating under explicit physical constraints. Hard safety constraints are enforced independently of the reward through action shielding and reachability-based admissible action sets, ensuring that unsafe behaviors are never intentionally selected during learning or execution. To capture nominal operation and recovery behavior within a single control architecture, the state space is partitioned into safe and unsafe regions based on membership in a safety box, and a mode-dependent reward is used to promote accurate tracking inside the safe region and recovery toward it when operating outside. To enable online tabular learning on continuous dynamics, a finite-state abstraction is constructed via state aggregation, and action selection and value updates are consistently restricted to admissible actions. The framework is demonstrated on a longitudinal point-mass hypersonic vehicle model with aerodynamic and propulsion couplings, using angle of attack and throttle as control inputs.</description>

      <title>Towards X-embodiment safety: A control theory perspective on transferring safety certificates across dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a powerful tool for enforcing safety constraints in control systems, but their direct application to complex, high-dimensional dynamics is often challenging. In many settings, safety certificates are more naturally designed for simplified or alternative system models that do not exactly match the dynamics of interest. This paper addresses the problem of transferring safety guarantees between dynamical systems with mismatched dynamics. We propose a transferred control barrier function (tCBF) framework that enables safety constraints defined on one system to be systematically enforced on another system using a simulation function and an explicit margin term. The resulting transferred barrier accounts for model mismatch and induces a safety condition that can be enforced on the target system via a quadratic-program-based safety filter. The proposed approach is general and does not require the two systems to share the same state dimension or dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on a quadrotor navigation task with the transferred barrier ensuring collision avoidance for the target system, while remaining minimally invasive to a nominal controller. These results highlight the potential of transferred control barrier functions as a general mechanism for enforcing safety across heterogeneous dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Modular Safety Guardrails Are Necessary for Foundation-Model-Enabled Robots in the Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has accelerated real-world deployment, while introducing new safety challenges arising from open-ended semantic reasoning and embodied physical action. These challenges require safety notions beyond physical constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we characterize FM-enabled robot safety along three dimensions: action safety (physical feasibility and constraint compliance), decision safety (semantic and contextual appropriateness), and human-centered safety (conformance to human intent, norms, and expectations). We argue that existing approaches, including static verification, monolithic controllers, and end-to-end learned policies, are insufficient in settings where tasks, environments, and human expectations are open-ended, long-tailed, and subject to adaptation over time. To address this gap, we propose modular safety guardrails, consisting of monitoring (evaluation) and intervention layers, as an architectural foundation for comprehensive safety across the autonomy stack. Beyond modularity, we highlight possible cross-layer co-design opportunities through representation alignment and conservatism allocation to enable faster, less conservative, and more effective safety enforcement. We call on the community to explore richer guardrail modules and principled co-design strategies to advance safe real-world physical AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) using Koopman Operator Theory for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

      <title>Mitigation of Structural Harmonic Instability in Virtual Admittance-Based Grid-Forming Inverters via Mimicking Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The virtual admittance-current controller (VA-CC) scheme is widely employed to emulate an equivalent inductance in front of the internal voltage source of grid-forming inverters. However, recent studies have reported harmonic instabilities associated with VA-CC, motivating the need for a more physically interpretable understanding of their origin. This letter identifies a delay-independent structural mechanism of harmonic instability in the VA-CC scheme, wherein the interaction between the filter and virtual inductances introduces a non-passive second-order transfer-function term exhibiting negative resistance. To address this issue, a simple yet effective modification is proposed by integrating a parallel virtual resistor into the VA structure. This reconfiguration enhances the passivity of VA-CC scheme across the harmonic range by mimicking the skin effect which augments damping in high-frequency range, without altering the wellestablished current controller or voltage feedforward control. Experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves robust harmonic stability, whereas the conventional approach fails under identical grid conditions.</description>

      <title>Parameter Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing: A Particle-Belief MDP Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter-privacy-preserving data sharing in continuous-state dynamical systems, where a data owner designs a data-sharing policy to support downstream estimation and control while preventing adversarial inference of a sensitive parameter. This data-sharing problem is formulated as an optimization problem that trades off privacy leakage and the impact of data sharing on the data owner's utility, subject to a data-usability constraint. We show that this problem admits an equivalent belief Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, which provides a simplified representation of the optimal policy. To efficiently characterize information-theoretic privacy leakage in continuous state and action spaces, we propose a particle-belief MDP formulation that tracks the parameter posterior via sequential Monte Carlo, yielding a tractable belief-state approximation that converges asymptotically as the number of particles increases. We further derive a tractable closed-form upper bound on particle-based MI via Gaussian mixture approximations, which enables efficient optimization of the particle-belief MDP. Experiments on a mixed-autonomy platoon show that the learned continuous policy substantially impedes inference attacks on human-driving behavior parameters while maintaining data usability and system performance.</description>

      <title>Peak Bounds for the Estimation Error under Sensor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates bounds on the estimation error of a linear system affected by norm-bounded disturbances and full sensor attacks. The system is equipped with a detector that evaluates the norm of the innovation signal to detect faults, and the attacker wants to avoid detection. We utilize induced $L_\infty$ system norms, also called \emph{peak-to-peak} norms, to compare the estimation error bounds under nominal operations and under attack. This leads to a sufficient condition for when the bound on the estimation error is smaller during an attack than during nominal operation. This condition is independent of the attack strategy and depends only on the attacker's desire to remain undetected and (indirectly) the observer gain. Therefore, we investigate both an observer design method, that seeks to reduce the error bound under attack while keeping the nominal error bound low, and detector threshold tuning. As a numerical illustration, we show how a sensor attack can deactivate a robust safety filter based on control barrier functions if the attacked error bound is larger than the nominal one. We also statistically evaluate our observer design method and the effect of the detector threshold.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Home Energy Management with Heterogeneous Batteries and Stochastic EV Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of photovoltaic (PV), electric vehicles (EVs), and stationary energy storage systems (ESS) in households increases system complexity while simultaneously offering new opportunities for energy regulation. However, effectively coordinating these resources under uncertainties remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel home energy management framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can jointly minimise energy expenditure and battery degradation while guaranteeing occupant comfort and EV charging requirements. Distinct from existing studies, we explicitly account for the heterogeneous degradation characteristics of stationary and EV batteries in the optimisation, alongside stochastic user behaviour regarding arrival time, departure time, and driving distance. The energy scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and solved using a Lagrangian soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn optimal control policies that enforce physical constraints, including indoor temperature bounds and target EV state of charge upon departure, despite stochastic uncertainties. Numerical simulations over a one-year horizon demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in satisfying physical constraints while eliminating thermal oscillations and achieving significant economic benefits. Specifically, the method reduces the cumulative operating cost substantially compared to two standard rule-based baselines while simultaneously decreasing battery degradation costs by 8.44%.</description>

      <title>Safe Adaptive Control of Parabolic PDE-ODE Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a safe adaptive boundary control strategy for a class of parabolic partial differential equation-ordinary differential equation (PDE-ODE) cascaded systems with parametric uncertainties in both the PDE and ODE subsystems. The proposed design is built upon an adaptive Control Barrier Function (aCBF) framework that incorporates high-relative-degree CBFs together with a batch least-squares identification (BaLSI)-based adaptive control that guarantees exact parameter identification in finite time. The proposed control law ensures that: (i) if the system output state initially lies within a prescribed safe set, safety is maintained for all time; otherwise, the output is driven back into the safe region within a preassigned finite time; and (ii) convergence to zero of all plant states is achieved. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Constraint Tightening for Nonlinear MPC for Autonomous Racing via Contraction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a robust nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for path tracking in autonomous vehicles operating at the limits of handling utilizing a Control Contraction Metric (CCM) derived from a perturbed dynamic single track model. We first present a nonlinear MPC scheme for autonomous vehicles. Building on this nominal scheme, we assume limited uncertainty in tire parameters as well as bounded force disturbances in both lateral and longitudinal directions. By simplifying the perturbed model, we optimize a CCM for the uncertain model, which is validated through simulations at the dynamic limits of vehicle performance. This CCM is subsequently employed to parameterize a homothetic tube used for constraint tightening within the MPC formulation. The resulting robust nonlinear MPC is computationally more efficient than competing methods, as it introduces only a single additional state variable into the prediction model compared to the nominal scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the homothetic tube expands most significantly in regions where the nominal scheme would otherwise violate constraints, illustrating its ability to capture all uncertain trajectories while avoiding unnecessary conservatism.</description>

      <title>Control Lyapunov Functions for Optimality in Sontag-Type Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF), Sontag's famous Formula provides a nonlinear state-feedback guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the setpoint. At the same time, a cost function that depends on the CLF is minimized. While there exist methods to construct CLFs for certain classes of systems, the impact on the resulting performance is unclear. This article aims to make two contributions to this problem: (1) We show that using the value function of an LQR design as CLF, the resulting Sontag-type controller minimizes a classical quadratic cost around the setpoint and a CLF-dependent cost within the domain where the CLF condition holds. We also show that the closed-loop system is stable within a local region at least as large as that generated by the LQR. (2) We show a related CLF design for feedback-linearizable systems resulting in a global CLF in a straight-forward manner; The Sontag design then guarantees global asymptotic stability while minimizing a quadratic cost at the setpoint and a CLF-dependent cost in the whole state-space. Both designs are constructive and easily applicable to nonlinear multi-input systems under mild assumptions.</description>

      <title>SQP-Based Cable-Tension Allocation for Multi-Drone Load Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Aerial Load Transport Systems (MAATS) offer greater payload capacity and fault tolerance than single-drone solutions. However, they have an underdetermined tension allocation problem that leads to uneven energy distribution, cable slack, or collisions between drones and cables. This paper presents a real-time optimization layer that improves a hierarchical load-position-attitude controller by incorporating a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm. The SQP formulation minimizes the sum of squared cable tensions while imposing a cable-alignment penalty that discourages small inter-cable angles, thereby preventing tether convergence without altering the reference trajectory. We tested the method under nominal conditions by running numerical simulations of four quadrotors. Computational experiments based on numerical simulations demonstrate that the SQP routine runs in a few milliseconds on standard hardware, indicating feasibility for real-time use. A sensitivity analysis confirms that the gain of the cable-alignment penalty can be tuned online, enabling a controllable trade-off between safety margin and energy consumption with no measurable degradation of tracking performance in simulation. This framework provides a scalable path to safe and energy-balanced cooperative load transport in practical deployments.</description>

      <title>eCP: Informative uncertainty quantification via Equivariantized Conformal Prediction with pre-trained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of group symmetrization of pre-trained models on conformal prediction (CP), a post-hoc, distribution-free, finite-sample method of uncertainty quantification that offers formal coverage guarantees under the assumption of data exchangeability. Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels. We then propose an experimental design to test these theoretical claims in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>Control and State Estimation of Vehicle-Mounted Aerial Systems in GPS-Denied, Non-Inertial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robust control and estimation framework for quadrotors operating in Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-denied, non-inertial environments where inertial sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) become unreliable due to platform-induced accelerations. In such settings, conventional estimators fail to distinguish whether the measured accelerations arise from the quadrotor itself or from the non-inertial platform, leading to drift and control degradation. Unlike conventional approaches that depend heavily on IMU and GNSS, our method relies exclusively on external position measurements combined with a Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs (EKF-UI) to account for platform motion. The estimator is paired with a cascaded PID controller for full 3D tracking. To isolate estimator performance from localization errors, all tests are conducted using high-precision motion capture systems. Experimental results in a moving-cart testbed validate our approach under both translational in X-axis and Y-axis dissonance. Compared to standard EKF, the proposed method significantly improves stability and trajectory tracking without requiring inertial feedback, enabling practical deployment on moving platforms such as trucks or elevators.</description>

      <title>Sampled-Data Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Control of Multiplicative Systems: A Convex Relaxation with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust optimal control of sampled-data stochastic systems with multiplicative noise and distributional ambiguity. We consider a class of discrete-time optimal control problems where the controller \emph{jointly} selects a feedback policy and a sampling period to maximize the worst-case expected concave utility of the inter-sample growth factor. Modeling uncertainty via a Wasserstein ambiguity set, we confront the structural obstacle of~``concave-max'' geometry arising from maximizing a concave utility against an adversarial distribution. Unlike standard convex loss minimization, the dual reformulation here requires a minimax interchange within the semi-infinite constraints, where the utility's concavity precludes exact strong duality. To address this, we utilize a general minimax inequality to derive a tractable convex relaxation. Our approach yields a rigorous lower bound that functions as a probabilistic performance guarantee. We establish an explicit, non-asymptotic bound on the resulting duality gap, proving that the approximation error is uniformly controlled by the Lipschitz-smoothness of the stage reward and the diameter of the disturbance support. Furthermore, we introduce necessary and sufficient conditions for \emph{robust viability}, ensuring state positivity invariance across the entire ambiguity set. Finally, we bridge the gap between static optimization and dynamic performance, proving that the optimal value of the relaxation serves as a rigorous deterministic floor for the asymptotic average utility rate almost surely. The framework is illustrated on a log-optimal portfolio control problem, which serves as a canonical instance of multiplicative stochastic control.</description>

      <title>A Path-Complete Approach for Optimal Control of Switched Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the value function of discrete-time switched systems under arbitrary switching. Unlike the switched LQR problem, where both inputs and mode sequences are optimized, we consider the case where switching is exogenous. For such systems, the number of possible mode sequences grows exponentially with time, making the exact computation of the value function intractable. This motivates the development of tractable bounds that approximate it. We propose a novel framework, based on path-complete graphs, for constructing computable upper bounds on the value function. In this framework, multiple quadratic functions are combined through a directed graph that encodes dynamic programming inequalities, yielding convex and sound formulations. For example, for switched linear systems with quadratic cost, we derive tractable LMI-based formulations and provide computational complexity bounds. We further establish approximation guarantees for the upper bounds and show asymptotic non-conservativeness using concepts from graph theory. Finally, we extend the approach to controller synthesis for systems with affine control inputs and demonstrate its effectiveness on numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Resilient Load Forecasting under Climate Change: Adaptive Conditional Neural Processes for Few-Shot Extreme Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.</description>

      <title>On Data-Driven Unbiased Predictors using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator and its data-driven approximations, such as extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), are widely used for analysing, modelling, and controlling nonlinear dynamical systems. However, when the true Koopman eigenfunctions cannot be identified from finite data, multi-step predictions may suffer from structural inaccuracies and systematic bias. To address this issue, we analyse the first and second moments of the multi-step prediction residual. By decomposing the residual into contributions from the one-step approximation error and the propagation of accumulated inaccuracies, we derive a closed-form expression characterising these effects. This analysis enables the development of a novel and computationally efficient algorithm that enforces unbiasedness and reduces variance in the resulting predictor. The proposed method is validated in numerical simulations, showing improved uncertainty properties compared to standard EDMD. These results lay the foundation for uncertainty-aware and unbiased Koopman-based prediction frameworks that can be extended to controlled and stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Review of Superconducting Qubit Devices and Their Large-Scale Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting qubit quantum computer is one of the most promising quantum computing architectures for large-scale integration due to its maturity and close proximity to the well-established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. From an education perspective, it also bridges classical microwave electronics and quantum electrodynamics. In this paper, we will review the basics of quantum computers, superconductivity, and Josephson junctions. We then introduce important technologies and concepts related to DiVincenzo's criteria, which are the necessary conditions for the superconducting qubits to work as a useful quantum computer. Firstly, we will discuss various types of superconducting qubits formed with Josephson junctions, from which we will understand the trade-off across multiple design parameters, including their noise immunity. Secondly, we will discuss different schemes to achieve entanglement gate operations, which are a major bottleneck in achieving more efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. Thirdly, we will review readout engineering, including the implementations of the Purcell filters and quantum-limited amplifiers. Finally, we will discuss the nature and review the studies of two-level system defects, which are currently the limiting factor of qubit coherence time. DiVincenzo's criteria are only the necessary conditions for a technology to be eligible for quantum computing. To have a useful quantum computer, large-scale integration is required. We will review proposals and developments for the large-scale integration of superconducting qubit devices. By comparing with the application of electronic design automation (EDA) in semiconductors, we will also review the use of EDA in superconducting qubit quantum computer design, which is necessary for its large-scale integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present methods and applications for the development of digital twins (DT) for urban traffic management. While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its ``eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add value to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies, in other words, cyberphysical systems. This paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.</description>

      <title>EVOLVE: a Value-Added Services Platform for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A notable challenge in Electric Vehicle (EV) charging is the time required to fully charge the battery, which can range from 15 minutes to 2-3 hours. This idle period, however, presents an opportunity to offer time-consuming or data-intensive services such as vehicular software updates. ISO 15118 referred to the concept of Value-Added Services (VAS) in the charging scenario, but it remained underexplored in the literature. Our paper addresses this gap by proposing \acronym, the first EV charger compute architecture that supports secure on-charger universal applications with upstream and downstream communication. The architecture covers the end-to-end hardware/software stack, including standard API for vehicles and IT infrastructure. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of \acronym by employing and evaluating three suggested value-added services: vehicular software updates, security information and event management (SIEM), and secure payments. The results demonstrate significant reductions in bandwidth utilization and latency, as well as high throughput, which supports this novel concept and suggests a promising business model for Electric Vehicle charging station operation.</description>

      <title>Structure Identification of NDS with Descriptor Subsystems under Asynchronous, Non-Uniform, and Slow-Rate Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends previous identification method to the asynchronous sampling scenario, enabling the simultaneous handling of asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow-rate sampling conditions. Moving beyond lumped systems, the proposed framework targets the identification of interconnection structure of Networked Dynamic Systems (NDS) with descriptor-form subsystems. In the first stage, right tangential interpolations are estimated from steady-state outputs, allowing all asynchronous samples to be fused into a unified estimator. In the second stage, a left null-space projection is employed to decouple the bilinear dependence between state-related matrices and interconnection parameters, reducing the identification problem to two successive linear estimation problems. The proposed approach eliminates the full-normal-rank transfer matrix assumption required in previous work, while providing theoretical guarantees of mean-square consistency and asymptotic unbiasedness. Numerical results demonstrate that the framework can accurately recover the system structure, even under severe sampling irregularities.</description>

      <title>Boosting the transient performance of reference tracking controllers with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reference tracking is a key objective in many control systems, including those characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics. In these settings, traditional control approaches can effectively ensure steady-state accuracy but often struggle to explicitly optimize transient performance. Neural network controllers have gained popularity due to their adaptability to nonlinearities and disturbances; however, they often lack formal closed-loop stability and performance guarantees. To address these challenges, a recently proposed neural-network control framework known as Performance Boosting (PB) has demonstrated the ability to maintain $\mathcal{L}_p$ stability properties of nonlinear systems while optimizing generic transient costs.
  This paper extends the PB approach to reference tracking problems. First, we characterize the complete set of nonlinear controllers that preserve desired tracking properties for nonlinear systems equipped with base reference-tracking controllers. Then, we show how to optimize transient costs while searching within subsets of tracking controllers that incorporate expressive neural network models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of our method to uncertainties in the underlying system dynamics. Numerical simulations on a robotic system demonstrate the advantages of our approach over the standard PB framework.</description>

      <title>Steering the Herd: A Framework for LLM-based Control of Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms increasingly serve as information mediators--from social media feeds and targeted advertising to the increasing ubiquity of LLMs. This engenders a joint process where agents combine private, algorithmically-mediated signals with learning from peers to arrive at decisions. To study such settings, we introduce a model of controlled sequential social learning in which an information-mediating planner (e.g. an LLM) controls the information structure of agents while they also learn from the decisions of earlier agents. The planner may seek to improve social welfare (altruistic planner) or to induce a specific action the planner prefers (biased planner). Our framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that combines dynamic programming with decentralized action choices and Bayesian belief updates. We prove the convexity of the value function and characterize the optimal policies of altruistic and biased planners, which attain desired tradeoffs between the costs they incur and the payoffs they earn from induced agent choices. Notably, in some regimes the biased planner intentionally obfuscates the agents' signals. Even under stringent transparency constraints--information parity with individuals, no lying or cherry-picking, and full observability--we show that information mediation can substantially shift social welfare in either direction. We complement our theory with simulations in which LLMs act as both planner and agents. Notably, the LLM planner in our simulations exhibits emergent strategic behavior in steering public opinion that broadly mirrors the trends predicted, though key deviations suggest the influence of non-Bayesian reasoning consistent with the cognitive patterns of both humans and LLMs trained on human-like data. Together, we establish our framework as a tractable basis for studying the impact and regulation of LLM information mediators.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Greenhouse Climate Regulation in Lettuce Cultivation Using BiLSTM and GRU Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient greenhouse management is essential for sustainable food production, but the high energy demand for climate regulation poses significant economic and environmental challenges. While traditional process-based greenhouse models exist, they are often too complex or imprecise for reliable control. To address this, our study introduces a novel data-driven predictive control framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture. Training data were generated from a validated dynamic model simulating lettuce cultivation under various environmental conditions. The LSTM and GRU networks were trained to predict future greenhouse states -- including temperature, humidity, CO\textsubscript{2} concentration, and crop dry matter -- with robustness confirmed via $10$-fold cross-validation. These networks were embedded into an online MPC controller to optimize heating, ventilation, and CO\textsubscript{2} injection, aiming to minimize energy consumption and maximize crop yield while respecting biological constraints. Results showed that both the LSTM- and GRU-based controllers significantly outperformed a conventional MPC baseline. For example, humidity violations dropped from 54.77\% (MPC) to 15.45\% (GRU) and 17.71\% (LSTM), while day-night temperature deviations were kept below $2^\circ\text{C}$. The GRU controller further achieved up to 40\% lower computation time than its LSTM counterpart, confirming its real-time feasibility. Overall, the proposed GRU-driven predictive control approach offers a robust and computationally efficient solution for intelligent greenhouse climate automation under practical operational constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a robust adaptive control strategy for discrete-time systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure safety under parametric model uncertainty and disturbances. A key contribution of this work is establishing a barrier function certificate in discrete time for general online parameter estimation algorithms. This barrier function certificate guarantees positive invariance of the safe set despite disturbances and parametric uncertainty without access to the true system parameters. In addition, real-time implementation and inherent robustness guarantees are provided. The proposed robust adaptive safe control framework demonstrates that the parameter estimation module can be designed separately from the CBF-based safety filter, simplifying the development of safe adaptive controllers for discrete-time systems. The resulting safe control approach guarantees that the system remains within the safe set while adapting to model uncertainties, making it a promising strategy for discrete-time safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous ECG-PCG Acquisition System with Real-Time Burst-Adaptive Noise Cancellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac auscultation is an essential clinical skill, requiring excellent hearing to distinguish subtle differences in timing and pitch of heart sounds. However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited. Most of the existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either non-real-time or computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. We employ a burst adaptive normalized least mean square algorithm that adjusts its adaptation in response to high-energy, non-stationary hospital noise. The algorithm's performance was initially assessed using datasets with artificially induced noise. Subsequently, the complete end-to-end system was validated using real-world hospital recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the proposed system achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and 30.32 dB, respectively. Furthermore, complexity analysis confirms the pipeline's suitability for embedded implementation. These results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening in noisy hospital environments typical of resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15480v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate -- based on the theory of upper-$C^1$ functions -- the validity of standard, readily available smooth optimization to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we prove that the sequential quadratic programming algorithm converges to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points, and that such conditions are satisfied by any subgradient at a local minimum. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. From a practical point of view, we combine the local exploitation proposed above with a global exploration using Monte-Carlo sampling. The proposed approach is illustrated through the robust control of a mechanical system, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. We show that the constrained optimization effectively complements Monte-Carlo sampling by enabling fast detection of rare worst-case configurations, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Transient Stability Assessment: From Automated Simulation to Neural Architecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an LLM-driven, end-to-end workflow that addresses the lack of automation and intelligence in power system transient stability assessment (TSA). The proposed agentic framework integrates large language models (LLMs) with a professional simulator (ANDES) to automatically generate and filter disturbance scenarios from natural language, and employs an LLM-driven Neural Network Design (LLM-NND) pipeline to autonomously design and optimize TSA models through performance-guided, closed-loop feedback. On the IEEE 39-bus system, the LLM-NND models achieve 93.71% test accuracy on four-class TSA with only 4.78M parameters, while maintaining real-time inference latency (less than 0.95 ms per sample). Compared with a manually designed DenseNet (25.9M parameters, 80.05% accuracy), the proposed approach jointly improves accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy among domain-grounded retrieval, reasoning augmentation, and feedback mechanisms is essential for robust automation. The results demonstrate that LLM agents can reliably accelerate TSA research from scenario generation and data acquisition to model design and interpretation, offering a scalable paradigm that is readily extensible to other power system tasks such as optimal power flow, fault analysis, and market operations.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Chaos-based Input Shaper Design under Time-Varying Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work presented here investigates the application of polynomial chaos expansion toward input shaper design in order to maintain robustness in dynamical systems subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, this work intends to specifically address time-varying uncertainty by employing intrusive polynomial chaos expansion. The methodology presented is validated through numerical simulation of intrusive polynomial chaos expansion formulation applied to spring mass system experiencing time-varying uncertainty in the spring stiffness. The system also evaluates non-robust and robust input shapers through the framework in order to identify designs that minimize residual energy. Results indicate that vibration mitigation is achieved at a similar accuracy, yet at higher efficiency compared to a Monte Carlo framework.</description>

      <title>An Overview and Comparison of Spectral Bundle Methods for Primal and Dual Semidefinite Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral bundle method developed by Helmberg and Rendl is well-established for solving large-scale semidefinite programs (SDPs) in the dual form, especially when the SDPs admit $\textit{low-rank primal solutions}$. Under mild regularity conditions, a recent result by Ding and Grimmer has established fast linear convergence rates when the bundle method captures $\textit{the rank of primal solutions}$. In this paper, we present an overview and comparison of spectral bundle methods for solving both $\textit{primal}$ and $\textit{dual}$ SDPs. In particular, we introduce a new family of spectral bundle methods for solving SDPs in the $\textit{primal}$ form. The algorithm developments are parallel to those by Helmberg and Rendl, mirroring the elegant duality between primal and dual SDPs. The new family of spectral bundle methods also achieves linear convergence rates for primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and duality gap when the algorithm captures $\textit{the rank of the dual solutions}$. Therefore, the original spectral bundle method by Helmberg and Rendl is well-suited for SDPs with $\textit{low-rank primal solutions}$, while on the other hand, our new spectral bundle method works well for SDPs with $\textit{low-rank dual solutions}$. These theoretical findings are supported by a range of large-scale numerical experiments. Finally, we demonstrate that our new spectral bundle method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability for solving polynomial optimization compared to a set of baseline solvers $\textsf{SDPT3}$, $\textsf{MOSEK}$, $\textsf{CDCS}$, and $\textsf{SDPNAL+}$.</description>

      <title>Error bounds, PL condition, and quadratic growth for weakly convex functions, and linear convergences of proximal point methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many practical optimization problems lack strong convexity. Fortunately, recent studies have revealed that first-order algorithms also enjoy linear convergences under various weaker regularity conditions. While the relationship among different conditions for convex and smooth functions is well-understood, it is not the case for the nonsmooth setting. In this paper, we go beyond convexity and smoothness, and clarify the connections among common regularity conditions in the class of weakly convex functions, including $\textit{strong convexity}$, $\textit{restricted secant inequality}$, $\textit{subdifferential error bound}$, $\textit{Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality}$, and $\textit{quadratic growth}$. In addition, using these regularity conditions, we present a simple and modular proof for the linear convergence of the proximal point method (PPM) for convex and weakly convex optimization problems. The linear convergence also holds when the subproblems of PPM are solved inexactly with a proper control of inexactness.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Observer for Coupled Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-precision control for robotic systems is hindered by the low-fidelity dynamical model and external disturbances. Especially, the intricate coupling between internal uncertainties and external disturbances further exacerbates this challenge. This study introduces an effective and convergent algorithm enabling accurate estimation of the coupled disturbance via combining control and learning philosophies. Concretely, by resorting to Chebyshev series expansion, the coupled disturbance is firstly decomposed into an unknown parameter matrix and two known structures dependent on system state and external disturbance respectively. A regularized least squares algorithm is subsequently formalized to learn the parameter matrix using historical time-series data. Finally, a polynomial disturbance observer is specifically devised to achieve a high-precision estimation of the coupled disturbance by utilizing the learned portion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations and real flight tests. We believe this work can offer a new pathway to integrate learning approaches into control frameworks for addressing longstanding challenges in robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Information Shapes Koopman Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Navigation at the Nano-Scale: Algorithms, Architectures, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation for nano-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) is governed by extreme Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints (with the weight &lt; 50 g and sub-100 mW onboard processor), distinguishing it fundamentally from standard robotic paradigms. This review synthesizes the state-of-the-art in sensing, computing, and control architectures designed specifically for these sub- 100mW computational envelopes. We critically analyse the transition from classical geometry-based methods to emerging "Edge AI" paradigms, including quantized deep neural networks deployed on ultra-low-power System-on-Chips (SoCs) and neuromorphic event-based control. Beyond algorithms, we evaluate the hardware-software co-design requisite for autonomy, covering advancements in dense optical flow, optimized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and learning-based flight control. While significant progress has been observed in visual navigation and relative pose estimation, our analysis reveals persistent gaps in long-term endurance, robust obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, and the "Sim-to-Real" transfer of reinforcement learning policies. This survey provides a roadmap for bridging these gaps, advocating for hybrid architectures that fuse lightweight classical control with data-driven perception to enable fully autonomous, agile nano-UAVs in GPS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $&gt;40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</description>

      <title>On the Equilibrium between Feasible Zone and Uncertain Model in Safe Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of environmental exploration is a critical problem in reinforcement learning (RL). While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration. Experiments on classic control tasks show that our algorithm successfully expands the feasible zones with zero constraint violation, and achieves the equilibrium of safe exploration within a few iterations.</description>
