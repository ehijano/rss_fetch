      <title>Twisted topological correspondences and Cartan subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce twisted topological correspondences, which generalize both Katsura's topological correspondences as well as the twisted topological graphs introduced by Li. We show that, up to isomorphism, they are in bijection with certain principal bundles. This makes it possible to study topological correspondences using the machinery of principal and fiber bundles. We show how to associate a $C^*$-correspondence to a twisted topological correspondence, and give two different characterizations of the $C^*$-correspondences arising that way. The first one is the existence of an atlas of the vector bundle associated to the $C^*$-correspondence whose transition functions take values in a certain subgroup of the unitary group $U(n)$, and which is in some sense compatible with the left action. The other characterization is in terms of Cartan subalgebras in the compact operators on the $C^*$-correspondence. We use our findings to prove rigidity results of the $C^*$-correspondences associated to twisted topological correspondences.</description>

      <title>A Commuting Hamiltonian Framework for Quantum Time Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for quantum time transfer based on commuting families of Hamiltonians and synchronization observables. The synchronization subspace is defined as the kernel of a difference operator between local clocks, and we show that this subspace is preserved exactly by a commutative $*$-subalgebra of Hamiltonians compatible with the clocks. Our first main result establishes \emph{perturbative stability}: for $\epsilon$-compatible dynamics, where the commutator with the synchronization operator is bounded in norm by $\epsilon$, we prove quantitative drift bounds showing that timing correlations degrade at most linearly in time with slope proportional to $\epsilon$. Our second main result provides a \emph{representation-theoretic classification}: in the presence of a finite group symmetry, the synchronization subspace coincides with the diagonal isotypic component in the tensor product decomposition, and synchronization preservation is characterized by the commutant algebra of the group action. These results identify synchronization as a structural invariant of operator algebras, connecting approximate commutation, kernel-preserving dynamics, and symmetry protection. Beyond quantum time transfer, the framework suggests categorical and resource-theoretic generalizations and contributes to the broader study of operator-algebraic invariants in multipartite quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>MIPco=coRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2020, a landmark result by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen showed that MIP*, the class of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple computationally unbounded provers sharing entanglement in the tensor product model, is equal to RE. We show that the class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP* except with provers sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement, is equal to the class coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of MIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that the same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous framework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli basis test introduced by de la Salle [ArXiv:2204.07084].
  We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which we call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish that the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound. In addition to non-local games, this new condition could also potentially be applicable to other decision problems.</description>

      <title>Supercritical phase transition on the Toeplitz algebra of $\mathbb N^\times \ltimes \mathbb Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the high-temperature equilibrium for the C*-algebra $\mathcal T (\mathbb N^\times \ltimes \mathbb N)$ recently considered by an Huef, Laca and Raeburn. We show that the simplex of KMS$_\beta$ states at each inverse temperature $\beta$ in the critical interval $(0,1]$ is a Bauer simplex whose space of extreme points is homeomorphic to $\mathbb N \sqcup\{\infty\}$. This is in contrast to the uniqueness of equilibrium at high temperature observed in previously considered systems arising from number theory. We also show that quotients of our system exhibit spontaneous symmetry-breaking by finite cyclotomic Galois groups and establish their connection to the Bost-Connes phase transition.</description>

      <title>Description of the structure of DG--algebras via characters on a groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21784v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a description of graded derivations in group algebras. Using this result for arbitrary graduation of the group algebra, we describe all possible structures of DG algebras. The corresponding examples are given. The description is given in terms of characters on a groupoid analogous to the groupoid of inner action.</description>

      <title>Dehn fillings, equivariant homology, and the Baum-Connes conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Cohen-Lyndon triples and equivariant homology theory, with a focus on the Baum-Connes conjecture. In the first part of this work, we establish an excision sequence for the classifying spaces for proper actions in equivariant homology theories. This provides a direct link between Cohen-Lyndon triples and the left-hand side of the Baum-Connes conjecture. Independently of these, we prove that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients (BCC) with finite wreath products holds for all discrete hyperbolic groups, building on the monumental work of Lafforgue. Combining this with permanence properties and the work of Dahmani-Guirardel-Osin on relatively hyperbolic groups, we identify a broad class of groups, including all lattices in simple Lie groups of real rank one that satisfy the BCC with finite wreath products. This significantly broadens the scope of our first result, as Cohen-Lyndon triples arise naturally in the context of relatively hyperbolic groups, thereby connecting both sides of the Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <title>Relative higher index theory on quotients of Roe algebras and positive scalar curvature at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ quotients of Roe algebras as index containers for elliptic differential operators to study the existence problem of Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature on non-compact complete Riemannian manifolds. The non-vanishing of such an index locates the precise direction at infinity of the obstructions to positive scalar curvature, and may be viewed as a refinement of the positive scalar curvature problem. To achieve this, we formulate the relative coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and the relative coarse Novikov conjecture, together with their maximal versions, for general metric spaces as a program to compute the $K$-theory of the quotients of the Roe algebras relative to specific ideals. We show that if the metric space admits a relative fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space or an $\ell^p$-space, certain cases of these conjectures can be verified, which yield obstructions to the existence of uniformly positive scalar curvature metrics in specified directions at infinity. As an application, we prove that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for finite products of certain expander graphs that fail to admit fibred coarse embeddings into Hilbert space.</description>
