      <title>Strict Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorems for simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a simplicial complex is a near-cone of sufficiently high depth, then the only maximum families of small pairwise intersecting faces are those with a common intersection. Thus, near-cones of sufficiently high depth satisfy the strict Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado property conjectured by Holroyd and Talbot and by Borg. One consequence is a strict Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem for independence complexes of chordal graphs with an isolated vertex. Under stronger shiftedness conditions, we prove a sharper stability theorem of Hilton-Milner type, as well as two cross-intersecting theorems.</description>

      <title>Path Eccentricity and Forbidden Induced Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path eccentricity of a connected graph $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a path such that every vertex is at distance at most $k$ from the path. A result of Duffus, Jacobson, and Gould from 1981 states that every connected $\{\text{claw}, \text{net}\}$-free graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian path, that is, $G$ has path eccentricity~$0$. Several more recent works identified various classes of connected graphs with path eccentricity at most $1$, or, equivalently, graphs having a spanning caterpillar, including connected $P_5$-free graphs, AT-free graphs, and biconvex graphs. Generalizing all these results, we apply the work on structural distance domination of Bacs\'o and Tuza [Discrete Math., 2012] and characterize, for every positive integer $k$, graphs such that every connected induced subgraph has path eccentricity less than $k$. More specifically, we show that every connected $\{S_{k}, T_{k}\}$-free graph has a path eccentricity less than $k$, where $S_k$ and $T_k$ are two specific graphs of path eccentricity $k$ (a subdivided claw and the line graph of such a graph). As a consequence, every connected $H$-free graph has path eccentricity less than $k$ if and only if $H$ is an induced subgraph of $3P_{k}$ or $P_{2k+1} + P_{k-1}$. Our main result also answers an open question of Bastide, Hilaire, and Robinson [Discrete Math., 2025].</description>

      <title>Dirac-type condition for Hamilton-generated graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cycle space $\mathcal{C}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the linear space spanned by all cycles in $G$. For an integer $k\ge 3$, let $\mathcal{C}_k (G)$ denote the subspace of $\mathcal{C}(G)$ generated by the cycles of length exactly $k$. A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is called Hamilton-generated if $\mathcal{C}_n (G) = \mathcal{C}(G)$, meaning every cycle in $G$ is a symmetric difference of some Hamilton cycles of $G$. %A necessary condition for this property is that $n$ must be odd. Heinig (European J. Combin., 2014) showed that for any $\sigma &gt;0$ and sufficiently large odd $n$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree $(1+ \sigma)n/2$ is Hamilton-generated. He further posed the question that whether the minimum degree requirement could be lowered to the Dirac threshold $n/2$. Recent progress by Christoph, Nenadov, and Petrova~(arXiv:2402.01447) reduced the minimum degree condition to $n/2 + C$ for some large constant $C$. In this paper, we resolve Heinig's problem completely by proving that for sufficiently large odd $n$, every Hamilton-connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $(n-1)/2$ is Hamilton-generated. Moreover, this result is tight for the minimum degree and the Hamilton-connected condition. The proof relies on the parity-switcher technique introduced by Christoph, et al in their recent work, as well as a classification lemma that strengthens a previous result by Krivelevich, Lee, and Sudakov~(Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2014).</description>

      <title>Maximal Entropy Random Walks in Z: Random and non-random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW) is a natural process on a finite graph, introduced a few years ago with motivations from theoretical physics. The construction of this process relies on Perron-Frobenius theory for adjacency matrices.Generalizing to infinite graphs is rather delicate, and in this article, we treat in a fairly exhaustive manner the case of the MERW on Z with loops, for both random and nonrandom loops. Thanks to an explicit combinatorial representation of the corresponding Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors, we are able to precisely determine the asymptotic behavior of these walks. We show, in particular, that essentially all MERWs on Z with loops have positive speed.</description>

      <title>On cross-2-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal A\subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ and $\mathcal B\subseteq\binom{[n]}{\ell}$ are called cross-$t$-intersecting if $|A\cap B|\geq t$ for all $A\in\mathcal A$, $B\in\mathcal B$. Let $n$, $k$ and $\ell$ be positive integers such that $n\geq 3.38\ell$ and $\ell\geq k\geq 2$. In this paper, we will determine the upper bound of $|\mathcal A||\mathcal B|$ for cross-$2$-intersecting families $\mathcal A\subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ and $\mathcal B\subseteq\binom{[n]}{\ell}$. The structures of the extremal families attaining the upper bound are also characterized. The similar result obtained by Tokushige can be considered as a special case of ours when $k=\ell$, but under a more strong condition $n&gt;3.42k$. Moreover, combined with the results obtained in this paper, the complicated extremal structures attaining the upper bound for nontrivial cases can be relatively easy to reach with similar techniques.</description>

      <title>Simple $3$-designs of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,2^n)$ with block size $13$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates simple $3$-$(2^n+1,13,\lambda)$ designs admitting $\mathrm{PSL}$$(2,2^n)$ as an automorphism group. We determine all possible values of $\lambda$ by systematically analyzing the orbits of $13$-element subsets under the action of $\mathrm{PSL}$$(2, 2^n)$ on the projective line. While previous research has explored this topic by analyzing the structure of $k$-element subsets $B$ directly, we approach the problem using group theory and the Cauchy-Frobenius-Burnside lemma. This method provides an efficient framework that can be applied to larger block sizes where traditional enumeration methods become computationally infeasible.</description>

      <title>Global Least Common Ancestor (LCA) Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are fundamental structures used across many scientific fields. A key concept in DAGs is the least common ancestor (LCA), which plays a crucial role in understanding hierarchical relationships. Surprisingly little attention has been given to DAGs that admit a unique LCA for every subset of their vertices. Here, we characterize such global lca-DAGs and provide multiple structural and combinatorial characterizations. We show that global lca-DAGs have a close connection to join semi-lattices and establish a connection to forbidden topological minors. In addition, we introduce a constructive approach to generating global lca-DAGs and demonstrate that they can be recognized in polynomial time. We investigate their relationship to clustering systems and other set systems derived from the underlying DAGs.</description>

      <title>Counting cliques with prescribed intersection sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized Tur\'an problem regarding cliques with restricted intersections, which highlights the motivation from extremal set theory. Let $L=\{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s\}\subset [0,r-1]$ be a fixed integer set with $|L|\notin \{1,r\}$ and $\ell_1&lt;\dots&lt;\ell_s$, and let $\Psi_r(n,L)$ denote the maximum number of $r$-cliques in an $n$-vertex graph whose $r$-cliques are $L$-intersecting as a family of $r$-subsets. Helliar and Liu recently initiated the systematic study of the function $\Psi_r(n,L)$ and showed that $\Psi_r(n,L)\le \left(1-\frac{1}{3r}\right) \prod_{\ell\in L}\frac{n-\ell}{r-\ell}$ for large $n$, improving the trivial bound from the Deza--Erd\H{o}s--Frankl theorem by a factor of $1-\frac{1}{3r}$. In this article, we improve their result by showing that as $n$ goes to infinity $\Psi_r(n,L)=\Theta_{r,L}(n^{|L|})$ if and only if $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,r$ form an arithmetic progression and fully determining the corresponding exact values of $\Psi_r(n,L)$ for sufficiently large $n$ in this case. Moreover, when $L=[t,r-1]$, for the generalized Tur\'an extension of the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem given by Helliar and Liu, we show a Hilton--Milner-type stability result.</description>

      <title>Skew shapes, Ehrhart positivity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result by Kreweras (1965) allows one to compute the number of plane partitions of a given skew shape and bounded parts as certain determinants. We prove that these determinants expand as polynomials with nonnegative coefficients. This result can be reformulated in terms of order polynomials of cell posets of skew shapes, and explains important positivity phenomena about the Ehrhart polynomials of shard polytopes, matroids, and order polytopes. Among other applications, we generalize a positivity statement from Schubert calculus by Fomin and Kirillov (1997) from straight shapes to skew shapes. We show that all shard polytopes are Ehrhart positive and, stronger, that all fence posets, including the zig-zag poset, have order polynomials with nonnegative coefficients. We present a more general method for proving positivity which reduces to showing positivity of the linear terms of the order polynomials and we state conjectures on other positive classes of posets.</description>

      <title>A computational approach to rational summability and its applications via discrete residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rational function $f(x)$ is rationally summable if there exists a rational function $g(x)$ such that $f(x)=g(x+1)-g(x)$. Detecting whether a given rational function is summable is an important and basic computational subproblem that arises in algorithms to study diverse aspects of shift difference equations. The discrete residues introduced by Chen and Singer in 2012 enjoy the obstruction-theoretic property that a rational function is summable if and only if all its discrete residues vanish. However, these discrete residues are defined in terms of the data in the complete partial fraction decomposition of the given rational function, which cannot be accessed computationally in general. We explain how to efficiently compute (a rational representation of) the discrete residues of any rational function, relying only on gcd computations, linear algebra, and a black box algorithm to compute the autodispersion set of the denominator polynomial. We also explain how to apply our algorithms to serial summability and creative telescoping problems, and how to apply these computations to compute Galois groups of difference equations.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Limits of Recovering Planted Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary subgraph $H=H_n$ and $p=p_n \in (0,1)$, the planted subgraph model is defined as follows. A statistician observes the union a random copy $H^*$ of $H$, together with random noise in the form of an instance of an Erdos-Renyi graph $G(n,p)$. Their goal is to recover the planted $H^*$ from the observed graph. Our focus in this work is to understand the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) for sufficiently large $n$.
  A recent paper [MNSSZ23] characterizes the graphs for which the limiting MMSE curve undergoes a sharp phase transition from $0$ to $1$ as $p$ increases, a behavior known as the all-or-nothing phenomenon, up to a mild density assumption on $H$. In this paper, we provide a formula for the limiting MMSE curve for any graph $H=H_n$, up to the same mild density assumption. This curve is expressed in terms of a variational formula over pairs of subgraphs of $H$, and is inspired by the celebrated subgraph expectation thresholds from the probabilistic combinatorics literature [KK07]. Furthermore, we give a polynomial-time description of the optimizers of this variational problem. This allows one to efficiently approximately compute the MMSE curve for any dense graph $H$ when $n$ is large enough. The proof relies on a novel graph decomposition of $H$ as well as a new minimax theorem which may be of independent interest.
  Our results generalize to the setting of minimax rates of recovering arbitrary monotone boolean properties planted in random noise, where the statistician observes the union of a planted minimal element $A \subseteq [N]$ of a monotone property and a random $Ber(p)^{\otimes N}$ vector. In this setting, we provide a variational formula inspired by the so-called "fractional" expectation threshold [Tal10], again describing the MMSE curve (in this case up to a multiplicative constant) for large enough $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a 1986 paper, Smyth proposed a conjecture about which integer-linear relations were possible among Galois-conjugate algebraic numbers. We prove this conjecture. The main tools (as Smyth already anticipated) are combinatorial rather than number-theoretic in nature. For instance, the question can be reinterpreted as a question about the possible eigenvalues of a specified linear combination of permutation matrices. What's more, we reinterpret Smyth's conjecture as a local-to-global principle for a "non-deterministic system of equations" where variables are interpreted as compactly supported K-valued random variables (for K a local or global field) rather than as elements of K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stable roommates problem is a non-bipartite version of the well-known stable matching problem. Teo and Sethuraman proved that, for each instance of the stable roommates problem in the complete graphs, there exists a linear inequality system such that there exists a feasible solution to this system if and only if there exists a stable matching in the given instance. The aim of this paper is to extend the result of Teo and Sethuraman to the stable roommates problem with ties. More concretely, we prove that, for each instance of the stable roommates problem with ties in the complete graphs, there exists a linear inequality system such that there exists a feasible solution to this system if and only if there exists a super-stable matching in the given instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grothendieck classes of melonic graphs satisfy a recursive relation and may be written as polynomials in the class of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,4}$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, conjectured to be log-concave. In this article, we investigate log-concavity and ultra-log-concavity for the Grothendieck class of banana graphs and the three families of polynomials involved in the recursive relation. We prove that all four are log-concave, establishing the specific case of banana graphs for the log-concavity conjecture. We additionally introduce the infinite family of clasped necklaces, melonic graphs obtained by replacing an edge of a $2$-banana with a string of $m$-bananas. Using the recursive relation, we explicitly compute the classes of clasped necklaces and prove that they too are log-concave.</description>

Abstract: Continued fraction expansions provide a well-established bridge between algebraic properties of numbers and combinatorics on words. In this article, we investigate the algebraicity of $p$-adic numbers whose continued fractions arise from certain classes of words which generalize the classical automatic, periodic and palindromic words. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions on the $p$-adic continued fraction expansion, such numbers are either algebraic of degree at most 2 or transcendental. This result provides an analogue of results of Bugeaud and Adamczewski-Bugeaud in the real setting and extends previous works that were limited to specific choices of $p$-adic floor functions and less general classes of words.</description>

      <title>On the Polynomial Szemer\'edi Theorem in Finite Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem implies that, for any $\delta \in (0,1)$, any family $\{P_1,\ldots, P_m\} \subset \mathbb{Z}[y]$ of nonconstant polynomials with constant term zero, and any sufficiently large $N$, every subset of $\{1,\ldots, N\}$ of cardinality at least $\delta N$ contains a nontrivial configuration of the form $\{x,x+P_1(y),\ldots, x+P_m(y)\}$. When the polynomials are assumed independent, one can expect a sharper result to hold over finite fields, special cases of which were proven recently, culminating with arXiv:1802.02200, which deals with the general case of independent polynomials. One goal of this article is to explain these theorems as the result of joint ergodicity in the presence of asymptotic total ergodicity. Guided by this concept, we establish, over general finite commutative rings, a version of the polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem for independent polynomials $\{P_1,\ldots, P_m\} \subset \mathbb{Z}[y_1,\ldots, y_n]$, deriving new combinatorial consequences, such as the following. Let $\mathcal R$ be a collection of finite commutative rings subject to a mild condition on their torsion. There exists $\gamma \in (0,1)$ such that, for every $R \in \mathcal R$, every subset $A \subset R$ of cardinality at least $|R|^{1-\gamma}$ contains a nontrivial configuration $\{x,x+P_1(y),\ldots, x+P_m(y)\}$ for some $(x,y) \in R \times R^n$, and, moreover, for any subsets $A_0,\ldots, A_m \subset R$ such that $|A_0|\cdots |A_m| \geq |R|^{(m+1)(1-\gamma)}$, there is a nontrivial configuration $(x, x+P_1(y), \ldots, x+P_m(y)) \in A_0\times \cdots \times A_m$. The fact that general rings have zero divisors is the source of many obstacles, which we overcome; for example, by studying character sums, we develop a bound on the number of roots of an integer polynomial over a general finite commutative ring, a result which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Frogs, hats and common subsequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Write $W^{(n)}$ to mean the $n$-letter word obtained by repeating a fixed word $W$ and let $R_n$ denote a uniformly random $n$-letter word sampled from the same alphabet as $W$. We are interested in the average length of the longest common subsequence between $W^{(n)}$ and $R_n$, which is known to be $\gamma(W)\cdot n+o(n)$ for some constant $\gamma(W)$. Bukh and Cox recently developed an interacting particle system, dubbed the frog dynamics, which can be used to compute the constant $\gamma(W)$ for any fixed word $W$. They successfully analyzed the simplest case of the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots k)$. We continue this study by using the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots kk\cdots 21)$. The frog dynamics in this case is a variation of the PushTASEP on the ring where some clocks are identical. Interestingly, exclusion processes with correlated clocks of this type appear to have not been analyzed before. Our analysis leads to a seemingly new combinatorial object which could be of independent interest: frogs with hats!</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quotients by radical monomial ideals for which $T^2$, the second cotangent cohomology module, vanishes. The dimension of the graded components of $T^2$, and thus their vanishing, depends only on the combinatorics of the corresponding simplicial complex. We give both a complete characterization and a full list of one dimensional complexes with $T^2=0$. We characterize the graded components of $T^2$ when the simplicial complex is a uniform matroid. Finally, we show that $T^2$ vanishes for all matroids of corank at most two and conjecture that all connected matroids with vanishing $T^2$ are of corank at most two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that for every set $U$ of vertices in a connected graph $G$ there is either a subdivided star in $G$ with a large number of leaves in $U$, or a comb in $G$ with a large number of teeth in $U$.
  In this paper we extend this property to directed graphs. More precisely, we prove that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every sufficiently large set $U$ of vertices in a strongly connected directed graph $D$, there exists a strongly connected butterfly minor of $D$ with $n$ teeth in $U$ that is either shaped by a star or shaped by a comb.</description>

      <title>New bounds on a generalization of Tuza's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, let $\nu^{(m)}(H)$ denote the maximum size of a set $S$ of edges of $H$ whose pairwise intersection has size less than $m$. Let $\tau^{(m)}(H)$ denote the minimum size of a set $S$ of $m$-sets of $V(H)$ such that every edge of $H$ contains some $m$-set from $S$. A conjecture by Aharoni and Zerbib, which generalizes a conjecture of Tuza on the size of minimum edge covers of triangles of a graph, states that for a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, $\tau^{(k - 1)}(H)/\nu^{(k - 1)}(H) \leq \left \lceil \frac{k + 1}{2} \right \rceil$. In this paper, we show that this generalization of Tuza's conjecture holds when $\nu^{(k - 1)}(H) \leq 3$. As a corollary, we obtain a graph class which satisfies Tuza's conjecture. We also prove various bounds on $\tau^{(m)}(H)/\nu^{(m)}(H)$ for other values of $m$ as well as some bounds on the fractional analogues of these numbers.</description>

Abstract: The Pl\"ucker positive region $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k)$ of the orthogonal Grassmannian emerged as the positive geometry behind the ABJM scattering amplitudes. In this paper we initiate the study of the positive orthogonal Grassmannian $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$ for general values of $k,n$. We determine the boundary structure of the quadric $\mathrm{OGr}_+(1,n)$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{+}$ and show that it is a positive geometry. We show that $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k+1)$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k+1, 2k+2)$ and connect its combinatorial structure to matchings on $[2k+2]$. Finally, we show that in the case $n&gt;2k+1$, the \emph{positroid cells} of $\mathrm{Gr}_+(k,n)$ do not induce a CW cell decomposition of $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$.</description>

      <title>On H-Intersecting Graph Families and Counting of Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work derives an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which the intersection of every two graphs in that family contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to a specified graph H. Such families are referred to as H-intersecting graph families. The bound is derived using the combinatorial version of Shearer's lemma, and it forms a nontrivial extension of the bound derived by Chung, Graham, Frankl, and Shearer (1986), where H is specialized to a triangle. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of H, while a relaxed version, formulated using the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of the complement of H, offers reduced computational complexity. Additionally, a probabilistic version of Shearer's lemma, combined with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of sequences and series under the action of the log-concave operator \(\mathcal{L}\). We explore the relationship between the convergence of a sequence \((a_k)\) and the convergence of sequences and series derived by applying \(\mathcal{L}\) iteratively. These results demonstrate the strong regularity properties of log-concave sequences and provide a framework for analyzing the convergence of sequences and series derived from the log-concave operator. The findings have implications for combinatorics, probability, optimization, and related fields, opening new avenues for further research on the behavior of log-concave sequences and their associated operators.</description>

Here $c^\dag(3) = 12/11$ and $c^\dag(4) = 7/6$, while $c^\dag(s) = 2$ for $s \geqslant 5$. We also establish density results with quantitative bounds. Following recent developments, we take this opportunity to update Browning and Prendiville's version of Green's Fourier-analytic transference principle, strengthening its conclusion.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into Line Graph Transformation on Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line graph transformation has been widely studied in graph theory, where each node in a line graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph. This has inspired a series of graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to transformed line graphs, which have proven effective in various graph representation learning tasks. However, there is limited theoretical study on how line graph transformation affects the expressivity of GNN models. In this study, we focus on two types of graphs known to be challenging to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests: Cai-F\"urer-Immerman (CFI) graphs and strongly regular graphs, and show that applying line graph transformation helps exclude these challenging graph properties, thus potentially assist WL tests in distinguishing these graphs. We empirically validate our findings by conducting a series of experiments that compare the accuracy and efficiency of graph isomorphism tests and GNNs on both line-transformed and original graphs across these graph structure types.</description>

      <title>On commuting pairs in arbitrary sets of 2x2 matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of $2 \times 2$ matrices with real entries. For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any finitely--supported probability measure $\mu$ on $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$, we prove that either \[ T(\mu) = \sum_{X, Y \in {\rm supp}(\mu), XY = YX} \mu(X) \mu(Y) &lt; \varepsilon \] or there exists some finite set ${S}$ contained in a $2$-dimensional subspace of $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\mu({S}) \geq \varepsilon/8$. This is sharp up to the multiplicative constant. We prove quantitatively stronger results when \[ \mu ( (a_{i,j})_{1 \leq i,j \leq 2} ) = \nu(a_{1,1}) \dots \nu(a_{2,2}) \ \ \text{for every} \ a_{1,1}, \dots, a_{2,2} \in \mathbb{R}, \]
  with $\nu$ being some finitely--supported probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$. For instance, when ${A} \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a generalised arithmetic progression or multiplicative progression of dimension $d$ and $\nu = {1}_{{A}}/|{A}|$, our techniques imply that $|{A}|^{-3} \ll_d T(\mu) \ll_d |{A}|^{-3}$. Our methods highlight the connections of this problem to results in incidence geometry, growth in groups phenomenon as well as Bourgain--Chang type sum-product estimates over $\mathbb{R}$. The latter includes applications of Schmidt's subspace theorem and the resolution of the weak polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa conjecture over integers.</description>

      <title>If Terao's conjecture fails in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$, then it fails in $\mathbb{P}^{n &gt; 2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an elementary technique, we construct a first example of Ziegler pairs of hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$. Then, using this construction, we show how to obtain possible counterexamples to Terao's freeness conjecture in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ with $n&gt;2$ using arrangements of lines in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Number of partitions of modular integers (with an Appendix by P. Deligne)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For integers $n,k,s$, we give a formula for the number $T(n,k,s)$ of order $k$ subsets of the ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose sum of elements is $s$ modulo $n$. To do so, we describe explicitly a sequence of matrices $M(k)$, for positive integers $k$, such that the size of $M(k)$ is the number of divisors of $k$, and for two coprime integers $k_{1},k_{2}$, the matrix $M(k_{1}k_{2})$ is the Kronecker product of $M(k_{1})$ and $M(k_{2})$. For $s=0, 1, 2$, and for $s=k/2$ when $k$ is even, the sequences $T(n,k,s)$ are related to the number of necklaces with $k$ black beads and $n-k$ white beads, and to Lyndon words. This work begins with empirical determinations of $M(k)$ up to $k=10000$, from which we infer a closed formula that encompasses many entries in the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Its proof comes from work on Ramanujan sums, by Ramanathan, with a generalization to wider problems linked to representation theory and recently described by Deligne.</description>

      <title>A new bound in Majority Dynamics on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of majority dynamics on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi $G(n,p)$ random graphs. In this process, each vertex of a graph is assigned one of two initial states. Subsequently, on every day, each vertex simultaneously updates its state to the most common state in its neighbourhood.
  If the difference in the numbers of vertices in each state on day $0$ is larger than $ \max \left\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}} \exp\left[A\sqrt{\log \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)}\right] , Bp^{-3/2} n^{-1/2} \right\}$ for constants $A$ and $B$, we demonstrate that the state with the initial majority wins with overwhelmingly high probability. This extends work by Linh Tran and Van Vu (2023), who previously considered this phenomenon.
  We also study majority dynamics with a random initial assignment of vertex states. When each vertex is assigned to a state with equal probability, we show that unanimity occurs with high probability for every $p \geq \lambda n^{-2/3}$, for some constant $\lambda$. This improves work by Fountoulakis, Kang and Makai (2020).
  Furthermore, we also consider a random initial assignment of vertex states where a vertex is slightly more likely to be in the first state than the second state. Previous work by Zehmakan (2018) and Tran and Vu (2023) provided conditions on how big this bias needs to be for the first colour to achieve unanimity with high probability. We strengthen these results by providing a weaker sufficient condition.</description>
