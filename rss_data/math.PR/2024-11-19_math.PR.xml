      <title>Strategies in a mis\`ere two-player guessing game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse an extension of the children's higher-or-lower number guessing game with two guessing players, where players alternate guessing a secret integer between 1 and n, and it is revealed whether these guesses are higher or lower than the secret number, with the first player to guess the number being the loser. We describe and prove the solution when both players are rational, which involves different guessing strategies dependent on the value of n modulo 4. We then consider the case where one player is not rational but instead makes all their guesses uniformly at random, while the other player plays to exploit this. We show that, in this case, the probability that the exploitative player wins approaches a constant (approximately 0.599) as n increases, and that the numbers 2 and n-1 are always optimal guesses for them.</description>

      <title>A convergence framework for Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble via pole evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble is an infinite sequence of random curves. It is a natural extension of the Tracy-Widom$_\beta$ distributions, and is expected to be the universal edge scaling limit of a range of models in random matrix theory and statistical mechanics. In this work, we provide a framework of proving convergence to the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble, via a characterization through the pole evolution of meromorphic functions satisfying certain stochastic differential equations. Our framework is then applied to prove the universality of the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble as the edge limit of various continuous time processes, including Dyson Brownian motions with general $\beta$ and potentials, Laguerre processes and Jacobi processes.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Perspective on the Injective Norm of Sums of Random Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix concentration inequalities, intimately connected to the Non-Commutative Khintchine inequality, have been an important tool in both applied and pure mathematics. We study tensor versions of these inequalities, and establish non-asymptotic inequalities for the $\ell_p$ injective norm of random tensors with correlated entries. In certain regimes of $p$ and the tensor order, our tensor concentration inequalities are nearly optimal in their dimension dependencies. We illustrate our result with applications to problems including structured models of random tensors and matrices, tensor PCA, and connections to lower bounds in coding theory.
  Our techniques are based on covering number estimates as opposed to operator theoretic tools, which also provide a geometric proof of a weaker version of the Non-Commutative Khintchine inequality, motivated by a question of Talagrand.</description>

      <title>Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble and its Laplace transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble is a random collection of continuous curves, which should serve as a universal edge scaling limit in problems related to eigenvalues of random matrices and models of 2d statistical mechanics. This line ensemble unifies many existing universal objects including Tracy-Widom distributions, eigenvalues of the Stochastic Airy Operator, Airy$_2$ process from the KPZ theory. Here $\beta&gt;0$ is a real parameter governing the strength of the repulsion between the curves.
  We introduce and characterize the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble in terms of the Laplace transform, by producing integral formulas for its joint multi-time moments. We prove two asymptotic theorems for each $\beta&gt;0$: the trajectories of the largest eigenvalues in the Dyson Brownian Motion converge to the Airy$_\beta$ line ensemble; the extreme particles in the G$\beta$E corners process converge to the same limit.
  The proofs are based on the convergence of random walk expansions for the multi-time moments of prelimit objects towards their Brownian counterparts. The expansions are produced through Dunkl differential-difference operators acting on multivariate Bessel generating functions.</description>

      <title>Universal constant order fluctuations for the cokernels of block lower triangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a large class of random block lower triangular matrices, the Sylow $p$-subgroups of their cokernels have the same constant order fluctuations as that of the matrix products studied by Nguyen and Van Peski in arXiv:2409.03099. We also show that the theorem of Nguyen and Van Peski remains true under a weaker assumption on the number of factors in the matrix products.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the solution of the filtering equations in spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear filtering is a pivotal problem that has attracted significant attention from mathematicians, statisticians, engineers, and various other scientific disciplines. The solution to this problem is governed by the so-called filtering equations. In this paper, we investigate the uniqueness of solutions to these equations within measure spaces and introduce a novel, generalized framework for this analysis. Our approach provides new insights and extends the applicability of existing theories in the study of nonlinear filtering.</description>

      <title>Ultra high order cumulants and quantitative CLT for polynomials in Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the study of the high order freeness of random matrices, it is known that the order $r$ cumulant of the trace of a polynomial of $N$-dimensional GUE/GOE is of order $N^{2-r}$ if $r$ is fixed. In this work, we extend the study along three directions. First, we also consider generally distributed Wigner matrices with subexponential entries. Second, we include the deterministic matrices into discussion and consider arbitrary polynomials in random matrices and deterministic matrices. Third, more importantly, we consider the ultra high order cumulants in the sense that $r$ is arbitrary, i.e., could be $N$ dependent. Our main results are the upper bounds of the ultra high order cumulants, for which not only the $N$-dependence but also the $r$-dependence become significant. These results are then used to derive three types of quantitative CLT for the trace of any given self-adjoint polynomial in these random matrix variables: a CLT with a Cram\'{e}r type correction, a Berry-Esseen bound, and a concentration inequality which captures both the Gaussian tail in the small deviation regime and $M$-dependent tail in the large deviation regime, where $M$ is the degree of the polynomial. In contrast to the second order freeness which implies the CLT for linear eigenvalue statistics of polynomials in random matrices, our study on the ultra high order cumulants leads to the quantitative versions of the CLT.</description>

      <title>Real Gaussian exponential sums via a real moment map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the expected number of solutions of a system of identically distributed exponential sums with centered Gaussian coefficient and arbitrary variance. We use the Adler and Taylor theory of Gaussian random fields to identify a moment map which allows to express the expected number of solution as an integral over the Newton polytope, in analogy with the Bernstein Khovanskii Kushnirenko Theorem. We apply this result to study the monotonicity of the expected number of solution with respect to the support of the exponential sum in an open set. We find that, when a point is added in the support in the interior of the Newton polytope there exists an open sets where the expected number of solutions decreases, answering negatively to a local version of a conjecture by B\"urgisser. When the point added in the support is far enough away from the Newton polytope we show that, in dimension 1, the number of solutions increases everywhere, while in dimension &gt;1 there is an unbounded open set where the number of solution decreases. We also prove some new lower bounds for the Aronszajn multiplication of exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional specific relative entropy between continuous martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous time, the laws of martingales tend to be singular to each other. Notably, N. Gantert introduced the concept of specific relative entropy between real-valued continuous martingales, defined as a scaling limit of finite-dimensional relative entropies, and showed that this quantity is non-trivial despite the aforementioned mutual singularity of martingale laws.
  Our main mathematical contribution is to extend this object, originally restricted to one-dimensional martingales, to multiple dimensions. Among other results, we establish that Gantert's inequality, bounding the specific relative entropy with respect to Wiener measure from below by an explicit functional of the quadratic variation, essentially carries over to higher dimensions. We also prove that this lower bound is tight, in the sense that it is the convex lower semicontinuous envelope of the specific relative entropy. This is a novel result even in dimension one. Finally we establish closed-form expressions for the specific relative entropy in simple multidimensional examples.</description>

      <title>The ballistic limit of the log-Sobolev constant equals the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant of a function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ characterizes the best exponential rate of convergence of gradient flow for $f$, uniformly over initializations. Meanwhile, in the theory of Markov diffusions, the log-Sobolev (LS) constant plays an analogous role, governing the exponential rate of convergence for the Langevin dynamics from arbitrary initialization in the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We establish a new connection between optimization and sampling by showing that the low temperature limit $\lim_{t\to 0^+} t^{-1} C_{\mathsf{LS}}(\mu_t)$ of the LS constant of $\mu_t \propto \exp(-f/t)$ is exactly the PL constant of $f$, under mild assumptions. In contrast, we show that the corresponding limit for the Poincar\'e constant is the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue of $\nabla^2 f$ at the minimizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) for a class of exactly solvable models in the setting of a chain with left and right reservoirs. Inspired by recent results on the harmonic model, we focus on models in which the NESS is a mixture of equilibrium product measures, and where the probability measure which describes the mixture has a spatial Markovian property. We completely characterize the structure of such mixture measures, and show that under natural scaling and translation invariance properties, the only possible mixture measures are coinciding with the Dirichlet process found earlier in the context of the harmonic model.</description>

Abstract: We consider Betti numbers of the excursion of a smooth Euclidean Gaussian field restricted to a rectangular window, in the asymptotics where the window grows to R^d . With motivations coming from Topological Data Analysis, we derive a functional Central Limit Theorem where the varying argument is the thresholding parameter, under assumptions of regularity and covariance decay for the field and its derivatives. We also show fixed-level CLTs coming from martingale based techniques inspired from the theory of geometric stabilisation, and limiting non-degenerate variance.</description>

      <title>Surface sums for lattice Yang-Mills in the large-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sum over weighted planar surfaces formula for Wilson loop expectations in the large-$N$ limit of strongly coupled lattice Yang-Mills theory, in any dimension. The weights of each surface are simple and expressed in terms of products of signed Catalan numbers.
  In establishing our results, the main novelty is to convert a recursive relation for Wilson loop expectations, known as the master loop equation, into a new peeling exploration of the planar surfaces. This exploration reveals hidden cancellations within the sums, enabling a deeper understanding of the structure of the planar surfaces.
  We view our results as a continuation of the program initiated in [CPS23] to understand Yang-Mills theories via surfaces and as a refinement of the string trajectories point-of-view developed in [Cha19a].</description>

      <title>Milstein-type schemes for McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure (with super-linear coefficients)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a general Milstein-type scheme for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure and the associated system of interacting particles where drift, diffusion and jump coefficients may grow super-linearly in the state variable and linearly in the measure component. The strong rate of $\mathcal{L}^2$-convergence of the proposed scheme is shown to be arbitrarily close to one under appropriate regularity assumptions on the coefficients. For the derivation of the Milstein scheme and to show its strong rate of convergence, we provide an It\^o formula for the interacting particle system connected with the McKean-Vlasov SDE driven by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. Moreover, we use the notion of Lions derivative to examine our results. The two-fold challenges arising due to the presence of the empirical measure and super-linearity of the jump coefficient are resolved by identifying and exploiting an appropriate coercivity-type condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends deterministic notions of Strong Stability Preservation (SSP) to the stochastic setting, enabling nonlinearly stable numerical solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with pathwise solutions that remain unconditionally bounded. This approach may offer modelling advantages in data assimilation, particularly when the signal or data is a realization of an SPDE or PDE with a monotonicity property.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Approximations for Stationary Distributions of McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the development of unbiased estimators, to approximate the stationary distribution of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs). These are an important class of processes, which frequently appear in applications such as mathematical finance, biology and opinion dynamics. Typically the stationary distribution is unknown and indeed one cannot simulate such processes exactly. As a result one commonly requires a time-discretization scheme which results in a discretization bias and a bias from not being able to simulate the associated stationary distribution. To overcome this bias, we present a new unbiased estimator taking motivation from the literature on unbiased Monte Carlo. We prove the unbiasedness of our estimator, under assumptions. In order to prove this we require developing ergodicity results of various discrete time processes, through an appropriate discretization scheme, towards the invariant measure. Numerous numerical experiments are provided, on a range of MVSDEs, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our unbiased estimator. Such examples include the Currie-Weiss model, a 3D neuroscience model and a parameter estimation problem.</description>

      <title>Mean Estimation in Banach Spaces Under Infinite Variance and Martingale Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider estimating the shared mean of a sequence of heavy-tailed random variables taking values in a Banach space. In particular, we revisit and extend a simple truncation-based mean estimator by Catoni and Giulini. While existing truncation-based approaches require a bound on the raw (non-central) second moment of observations, our results hold under a bound on either the central or non-central $p$th moment for some $p &gt; 1$. In particular, our results hold for distributions with infinite variance. The main contributions of the paper follow from exploiting connections between truncation-based mean estimation and the concentration of martingales in 2-smooth Banach spaces. We prove two types of time-uniform bounds on the distance between the estimator and unknown mean: line-crossing inequalities, which can be optimized for a fixed sample size $n$, and non-asymptotic law of the iterated logarithm type inequalities, which match the tightness of line-crossing inequalities at all points in time up to a doubly logarithmic factor in $n$. Our results do not depend on the dimension of the Banach space, hold under martingale dependence, and all constants in the inequalities are known and small.</description>

      <title>Longest subsequence for certain repeated up/down patterns in random permutations avoiding a pattern of length three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the set of permutations of $[n]$ and let $\sigma=\sigma_1\cdots\sigma_n\in S_n$. For a subsequence $\{\sigma_{i_j}\}_{j=1}^k$ of $\{\sigma_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of length $k\ge2$, construct
  the ``up/down'' sequence $V_1\cdots V_{k-1}$ defined by $$ V_j=\begin{cases} U,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&gt;0;\\ D,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&lt;0.\end{cases} $$ Consider now a fixed up/down pattern: $V_1\cdots V_l$, where $l\in\mathbb{N}$ and $V_j\in\{U, D\},\ j\in[l]$. Given a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$, consider the length of the longest subsequence of $\sigma$ that repeats this pattern.
  For example, consider $l=3$ and $V_1V_2V_3=UUD$. Then for the permutation $342617985\in S_9$, the length of the longest subsequence that repeats the pattern $UUD$ is 7; it is obtained by 3461798 and 3461785.
  The above framework includes two well-known cases. The pattern $U$ is the celebrated case of the longest increasing subsequence. The pattern $UD$ (or $DU$) is the case of the longest alternating subsequence. These have been studied both under the uniform distribution on $S_n$ as well as under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid a particular pattern of length three.
  In this paper, we consider the patterns $UUD$ and $UUUD$ under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid the pattern $132$. We prove that the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac37n$ and the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac4{11}n$. (For $UD$ (alternating subsequences) it is known to be $\frac12n$.) This leads directly to appropriate corresponding results for permutations avoiding any particular pattern of length three.</description>

      <title>Wall laws for viscous flows in 3D randomly rough pipes: optimal convergence rates and stochastic integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with effective approximations and wall laws of viscous laminar flows in 3D pipes with randomly rough boundaries. The random roughness is characterized by the boundary oscillation scale $\varepsilon \ll 1 $ and a probability space with ergodicity quantified by functional inequalities. The results in this paper generalize the previous work for 2D channel flows with random Lipschitz boundaries to 3D pipe flows with random boundaries of John type. Moreover, we establish the optimal convergence rates and substantially improve the stochastic integrability obtained in the previous studies. Additionally, we prove a refined version of the Poiseuille's law in 3D pipes with random boundaries, which seems unaddressed in the literature. Our systematic approach combines several classical and recent ideas (particularly from homogenization theory), including the Saint-Venant's principle for pipe flows, the large-scale regularity theory over rough boundaries, and applications of functional inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Bicriterion Concentration Inequality and Prophet Inequalities for $k$-Fold Matroid Unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate prophet inequalities with competitive ratios approaching $1$, seeking to generalize $k$-uniform matroids. We first show that large girth does not suffice: for all $k$, there exists a matroid of girth $\geq k$ and a prophet inequality instance on that matroid whose optimal competitive ration is $\frac{1}{2}$. Next, we show $k$-fold matroid unions do suffice: we provide a prophet inequality with competitive ratio $1-O(\sqrt{\frac{\log k}{k}})$ for any $k$-fold matroid union. Our prophet inequality follows from an online contention resolution scheme.
  The key technical ingredient in our online contention resolution scheme is a novel bicriterion concentration inequality for arbitrary monotone $1$-Lipschitz functions over independent items which may be of independent interest. Applied to our particular setting, our bicriterion concentration inequality yields "Chernoff-strength" concentration for a $1$-Lipschitz function that is not (approximately) self-bounding.</description>

      <title>Double jump in the maximum of two-type reducible branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a two-type reducible branching Brownian motion in which particles' diffusion coefficients and branching rates are influenced by their types. Here reducible means that type 1 particles can produce particles of type 1 and type 2, but type 2 particles can only produce particles of type 2. The maximum of this process is determined by two parameters: the ratio of the diffusion coefficients and the ratio of the branching rates for particles of different types. Belloum and Mallein [Electron. J. Probab. 26(2021), no. 61] identified three phases of the maximum and the extremal process, corresponding to three regions in the parameter space.
  We investigate how the extremal process behaves asymptotically when the parameters lie on the boundaries between these regions. An interesting phenomenon is that a double jump occurs in the maximum when the parameters cross the boundary of the so called anomalous spreading region, while only single jump occurs when the parameters cross the boundary between the remaining two regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the formalism required to analyze a certain class of stochastic control problems that involve a super diffusion as the underlying controlled system. To establish the existence of these processes, we show that they are weak scaling limits of controlled branching processes. First, we prove a generalized It\^o's formula for this dynamics in the space of finite measures, using the differentiation in the space of finite positive measures. This lays the groundwork for a PDE characterization of the value function of a control problem, which leads to a verification theorem. Finally, focusing on an exponential-type value function, we show how a regular solution to a finite--dimensional HJB equation can be used to construct a smooth solution to the HJB equation in the space of finite measures, via the so-called branching property technique.</description>

      <title>On the tradeoff between almost sure error tolerance and mean deviation frequency in martingale convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we quantify almost sure martingale convergence theorems in terms of the tradeoff between asymptotic almost sure rates of convergence (error tolerance) and the respective modulus of convergence. For this purpose we generalize {an} elementary quantitative version of the first Borel-Cantelli lemma on the statistics of the deviation frequencies (error incidence), which was recently established by the authors. First we study martingale convergence in $L^2$, and in the setting of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. In a second step we study the strong law of large numbers for martingale differences in two settings: uniformly bounded increments in $L^p$, $p\geq 2$, using the respective Baum-Katz-Stoica theorems, and uniformly bounded exponential moments with the help of the martingale estimates by Lesigne and Voln\'y. We also present applications for the tradeoff for the multicolor generalized P\'olya urn process, the Generalized Chinese restaurant process, statistical M-estimators, as well as the a.s.~excursion frequencies of the Galton-Watson branching process. Finally, we relate the tradeoff concept to the convergence in the Ky Fan metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a multidimensional ergodic theorem with weighted averages for the action of the group $\mathbb{Z}^d$ on a probability space. At level $n$ weights are of the form $n^{-d} \psi(j/n)$, $ j\in \mathbb{Z}^d$, for real functions $\psi$ decaying suitably fast. We discuss applications to random measures and to quenched stochastic homogenization of random walks on simple point processes with long-range random jump rates, allowing to remove the technical Assumption (A9) from \cite[Theorem~4.4]{Fhom1}. This last result concerns also some semigroup and resolvent convergence particularly relevant for the derivation of the quenched hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems via homogenization and duality. As a consequence we show that also the quenched hydrodynamic limit of the symmetric simple exclusion process on point processes stated in \cite[Theorem~4.1]{F_SEP} remains valid when removing the above mentioned Assumption (A9).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a Lorenz curve, derived from the distribution function of a random variable, can itself be viewed as a probability distribution function of a new random variable [4]. We prove the surprising result that a sequence of consecutive iterations of this map leads to a non-corner case convergence, independent of the initial random variable. In the primal case, both the limiting distribution and its parent follow a power-law distribution with coefficient equal to the golden ratio. In the reflected case, the limiting distribution is the Kumaraswamy distribution with a conjugate coefficient, while the parent distribution is the classical Pareto distribution. Potential applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of random stationary measures and applications to point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number rigidity of a point process $P$ entails that for a bounded set $A$ the knowledge of $P$ on $A^{c}$ a.s. determines $P(A)$; the $k$-order rigidity means we can recover the moments of $P1_{A}$ up to order $k$. We show that there is $k$-rigidity if the continuous component $s$ of $P$'s structure factor has a zero of order $k$ in 0, by exploiting a connection with Schwartz' Paley-Wiener theorem for analytic functions of exponential type; these results apply to any random $L^2$ wide sense stationary measure on $ \mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. In the continuous setting, these local conditions are also necessary if $s$ has finitely many zeros, or is isotropic, or at the opposite separable. This explains why no model seems to exhibit rigidity in dimension $d \ge 3$, and allows to efficiently recover many recent rigidity results about point processes. In the discrete setting, these results hold provided $\# A &gt;2k$. We derive new results about models of cluster lattices and give the first example of a stationary point process $P \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ exhibiting arbitrary low decay of the structure factor in 0, hence arbitrary high order of rigidity. For a continuous Determinantal point process with kernel $\kappa$, $k$-rigidity is equivalent to $(1-\widehat {\kappa^{2}})^{-1}$ having a zero of order $2k$ in 0, which answers questions on completeness and number rigidity. We also explore the consequences of these statements in the less tractable realm of Riesz gases.</description>

Abstract: One method to generate random permutations involves using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) on a random matrix $A$ and storing the permutation matrix factor $P$ from the resulting GEPP factorization $PA=LU$. We are interested in exploring properties of random butterfly permutations, which are generated using GEPP on specific random butterfly matrices. Our paper highlights new connections among random matrix theory, numerical linear algebra, group actions of rooted trees, and random permutations. We address the questions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and number of cycles for particular uniform butterfly permutations, with full distributional descriptions and limit theorems for simple butterfly permutations. We also establish scaling limit results and limit theorems for nonsimple butterfly permutations, which include certain $p$-Sylow subgroups of the symmetric group of $N=p^n$ elements for prime $p$. For the LIS, we establish power law bounds on the expected LIS of the form $N^{\alpha_p}$ and $N^{\beta_p}$ where $\frac12 &lt; \alpha_p &lt; \beta_p &lt; 1$ for each $p$ with $\alpha_p = 1 - o_p(1)$, showing distinction from the typical $O(N^{1/2})$ expected LIS frequently encountered in the study of random permutations (e.g., uniform permutations). For the number of cycles scaled by $(2-1/p)^n$, we establish a full CLT to a new limiting distribution depending on $p$ with positive support we introduce that is uniquely determined by its positive moments that satisfy explicit recursive formulas; this thus determines a CLT for the number of cycles for any uniform $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_{p^n}$.</description>

      <title>On stochastic control under Poisson observations: optimality of a barrier strategy in a general L\'evy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a version of the stochastic control problem of minimizing the sum of running and controlling costs, where control opportunities are restricted to independent Poisson arrival times. Under a general setting driven by a general L\'evy process, we show the optimality of a periodic barrier strategy, which moves the process upward to the barrier whenever it is observed to be below it. The convergence of the optimal solutions to those in the continuous-observation case is also shown.</description>

      <title>Suprema of L\'evy processes with completely monotone jumps: spectral-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spectral-theoretic properties of non-self-adjoint operators arising in the study of one-dimensional L\'evy processes with completely monotone jumps with a one-sided barrier. With no further assumptions, we provide an integral expression for the bivariate Laplace transform of the transition density $p_t^+(x, y)$ of the killed process in $(0, \infty)$, and under a minor regularity condition, a generalised eigenfunction expansion is given for the corresponding transition operator $P_t^+$. Assuming additionally appropriate growth of the characteristic exponent, we prove a generalised eigenfunction expansion of the transition density $p_t^+(x, y)$. Under similar conditions, we additionally show integral formulae for the cumulative distribution functions of the infimum and supremum functionals $\underline{X}_t$ and $\overline{X}_t$. The class of processes covered by our results include many stable and stable-like L\'evy processes, as well as many processes with Brownian components. Our results recover known expressions for the classical risk process, and provide similar integral formulae for some other simple examples of L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>Discrete stochastic maximal $ L^p $-regularity and convergence of a spatial semidiscretization for a stochastic parabolic equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04615v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the boundedness of the \( H^\infty \)-calculus for the negative discrete Laplace operator, subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The negative discrete Laplace operator is implemented using the finite element method, and we establish that its \(H^\infty\)-calculus is uniformly bounded with respect to the spatial mesh size. Using this finding, we derive a discrete stochastic maximal \(L^p\)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, we provide a nearly optimal pathwise uniform convergence estimate for this spatial semidiscretization under a wide range of spatial \(L^q\)-norms.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap bounds for reversible hybrid Gibbs chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid Gibbs samplers represent a prominent class of approximated Gibbs algorithms that utilize Markov chains to approximate conditional distributions, with the Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm standing out as a well-known example. Despite their widespread use in both statistical and non-statistical applications, little is known about their convergence properties. This article introduces novel methods for establishing bounds on the convergence rates of certain reversible hybrid Gibbs samplers. In particular, we examine the convergence characteristics of hybrid random-scan Gibbs algorithms. Our analysis reveals that the absolute spectral gap of a hybrid Gibbs chain can be bounded based on the absolute spectral gap of the exact Gibbs chain and the absolute spectral gaps of the Markov chains employed for conditional distribution approximations. We also provide a convergence bound of similar flavors for hybrid data augmentation algorithms, extending existing works on the topic. The general bounds are applied to three examples: a random-scan Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler, random-scan Gibbs samplers with block updates, and a hybrid slice sampler.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Pricing and Matching for Two-Sided Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic system with multiple types of customers and servers. Each type of waiting customer or server joins a separate queue, forming a bipartite graph with customer-side queues and server-side queues. The platform can match the servers and customers if their types are compatible. The matched pairs then leave the system. The platform will charge a customer a price according to their type when they arrive and will pay a server a price according to their type. The arrival rate of each queue is determined by the price according to some unknown demand or supply functions. Our goal is to design pricing and matching algorithms to maximize the profit of the platform with unknown demand and supply functions, while keeping queue lengths of both customers and servers below a predetermined threshold. This system can be used to model two-sided markets such as ride-sharing markets with passengers and drivers. The difficulties of the problem include simultaneous learning and decision making, and the tradeoff between maximizing profit and minimizing queue length. We use a longest-queue-first matching algorithm and propose a learning-based pricing algorithm, which combines gradient-free stochastic projected gradient ascent with bisection search. We prove that our proposed algorithm yields a sublinear regret $\tilde{O}(T^{5/6})$ and anytime queue-length bound $\tilde{O}(T^{1/6})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. We further establish a tradeoff between the regret bound and the queue-length bound: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ versus $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$ for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6].$</description>

      <title>Periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with distributional potential and invariant measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue some investigations on the periodic NLSE started by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer and by Bourgain with the addition of a distributional multiplicative potential. We prove that the equation is globally wellposed for a set of data of full normalized Gibbs measure, after suitable truncation in the focusing case. The set and the measure are invariant under the flow. The main ingredients used are Strichartz estimates on periodic NLS with distributional potential to obtain local well-posedness for low regularity initial data.</description>

      <title>4+3 Phases of Compute-Optimal Neural Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the solvable neural scaling model with three parameters: data complexity, target complexity, and model-parameter-count. We use this neural scaling model to derive new predictions about the compute-limited, infinite-data scaling law regime. To train the neural scaling model, we run one-pass stochastic gradient descent on a mean-squared loss. We derive a representation of the loss curves which holds over all iteration counts and improves in accuracy as the model parameter count grows. We then analyze the compute-optimal model-parameter-count, and identify 4 phases (+3 subphases) in the data-complexity/target-complexity phase-plane. The phase boundaries are determined by the relative importance of model capacity, optimizer noise, and embedding of the features. We furthermore derive, with mathematical proof and extensive numerical evidence, the scaling-law exponents in all of these phases, in particular computing the optimal model-parameter-count as a function of floating point operation budget.</description>

      <title>Errors-In-Variables Model Fitting for Partially Unpaired Data Utilizing Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for regression in the errors-in-variables regime, allowing for full flexibility about the dimensionality of the data, observational error probability density types, the (nonlinear) model type and the avoidance of ad-hoc definitions of loss functions. In this framework, we introduce model fitting for partially unpaired data, i.e. for given data groups the pairing information of input and output is lost (semi-supervised). This is achieved by constructing mixture model densities, which directly model the loss of pairing information allowing inference. In a numerical simulation study linear and nonlinear model fits are illustrated as well as a real data study is presented based on life expectancy data from the world bank utilizing a multiple linear regression model. These results show that high quality model fitting is possible with partially unpaired data, which opens the possibility for new applications with unfortunate or deliberate loss of pairing information in data.</description>

      <title>Polynomial mixing for white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the whole line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we can prove that the dynamics is attractive toward a unique invariant probability measure with polynomial rate of any power. In order to prove this, we further develop coupling method and establish a sufficiently general criterion for polynomial mixing. The proof of polynomial mixing for KSE is obtained by the combination of the coupling criterion and the Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of KSE on the whole line.</description>

      <title>Enhanced binding for a quantum particle coupled to scalar quantized field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum particle coupled to a scalar quantized field, such as the regularized Nelson model. We show that there are situations where the Hamiltonian of the particle alone does not have a bound state, while the particle-field Hamiltonian has a ground state. This complements results for other models such as the Pauli--Fierz model, where such results have been shown. When the uncoupled quantum particle already has a bound state, we provide a new technique to show that this bound state persists when coupling the particle to the field, for any coupling strength. We especially do not use the binding condition. Our results use the functional integral representation and rely on a recent method using the Gaussian correlation inequality.</description>

      <title>Zero-Coupon Treasury Yield Curve with VIX as Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multivariate autoregressive stochastic volatility model for the first 3 principal components (level, slope, curvature) of 10 series of zero-coupon Treasury bond rates with maturities from 1 to 10 years. We fit this model using monthly data from 1990. Next, we prove long-term stability for this discrete-time model and its continuous-time version. Unlike classic models with hidden stochastic volatility, here it is observed as VIX: the volatility index for the S\&amp;P 500 stock market index. It is surprising that this volatility, created for the stock market, also works for Treasury bonds. Since total returns of zero-coupon bonds can be easily found from these principal components, we prove long-term stability for total returns in discrete time.</description>
