      <title>A New Derivation of Classical Gravitational Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established that black holes have entropy and behave as thermodynamical systems. Associating entropy to gravitational fields has not remained limited to black holes, necessitating the notion of the second law of thermodynamics in gravitating systems. There have been many ideas and attempts to prove the second law in gravitational systems starting from first principles. Within the covariant phase space formalism, we define gravitational entropy as the charge associated with the local boosts, detaching the gravitational entropy from horizons or trapped surfaces. Our definition encompasses and generalizes the existing notions of entropy. Using this definition for the Einstein gravity case, we compute variations of the entropy along the path of any causal observer and establish that the entropy variations are always non-negative if the matter content satisfies the strong energy condition integrated along any segment of the causal path.</description>

      <title>Macdonald Index From Refined Kontsevich-Soibelman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a refinement of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operator for a class of ``special'' 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories characterized by the following conditions: (1) their Coulomb branch admits a source/sink chamber, i.e., a chamber in which the BPS quiver consists of only source and sink nodes, (2) The nodes with valency greater than 2 of the BPS quiver in a source/sink chamber are either all sources or all sinks. We present strong evidence that the trace of this refined operator is related to the Macdonald index of the theory. In particular, we conjecture closed form expressions for the Macdonald indices of the $(A_1,\mathfrak{g})$ Argyres-Douglas theories for any simply-laced Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Spectrum of the Open String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a large portion of the massive spectrum of the open bosonic string using light-cone quantization, providing explicit oscillator realizations for individual single-particle states as well as for full Regge trajectories. We show how combinations of transverse oscillators organize into irreducible SO(25) representations, and provide an algorithm for constructing them level by level. We then develop a general method to "climb" the spectrum-adding oscillators in a controlled way that generates entire Regge trajectories from a finite set of seed states. Remarkably, the coefficients determining each state's oscillator composition depend on the level in a simple way, allowing closed-form expressions for infinitely many states. Beyond individual trajectories, we explore internal regularities of the spectrum and establish relations among families of trajectories, extending the concept of a Regge trajectory to more general constructions. Our results expose a highly ordered and recursive structure underlying the open-string spectrum, suggesting that its massive excitations form an algorithmically constructible network. The framework presented here lays the groundwork for computing three-point amplitudes of arbitrary massive states, the essential building blocks of string interactions, which we tackle in upcoming work.</description>

      <title>Celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ Symmetries and Subleading Phase Space of Null Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuing our analysis of [1], we study the gravitational solution space around a null hypersurface in the bulk of spacetime, such as a black hole or a cosmological horizon. We discuss the corresponding characteristic initial value problem both in the metric and Newman-Penrose formalisms, and establish an explicit dictionary between the two. This allows us to identify Weyl-covariant structures in the solution space, including hierarchies of recursion relations encoding the flux-balance laws. We then establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space around the null hypersurface at finite distance. This connection is naturally formulated within the Newman-Penrose formalism by performing a partially off-shell conformal compactification and identifying the analogue of the Ashtekar-Streubel symplectic structure in the radial expansion near the null hypersurface. Using this framework, we identify the celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in the subleading phase space at finite distance by constructing their canonical generators and imposing self-duality conditions. This allows us to define a notion of covariant radiation, whose absence gives rise to an infinite tower of conserved charges, revealing physical quantities relevant to observers near black hole or cosmological horizons. As a concrete illustration, we consider the case of the self-dual Taub-NUT black hole.</description>

      <title>A genus-2 crossing equation in $d\geq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a "genus-2" crossing equation obeyed by CFTs in general dimensions $d\geq 2$. This crossing equation relates two different decompositions of the "genus-2 partition function" -- namely the partition function on the connected sum $M_2=(S^1\times S^{d-1})\sharp (S^1\times S^{d-1})$. The "sunrise" channel decomposition expresses $M_2$ as a pair of three-punctured spheres glued together with cylinders, while the "dumbbell" channel decomposition expresses $M_2$ as a gluing of two one-point functions on $S^1\times S^{d-1}$. We introduce coordinates to describe each channel, and write down Casimir equations obeyed by the corresponding blocks. We also explain why equality between the two channels guarantees mapping class group invariance of the genus-2 partition function in 3d CFTs. As an application of the genus-2 crossing equation, we derive a novel relation between asymptotics of "heavy-heavy-heavier" OPE coefficients and squares of thermal one-point coefficients in 3d CFTs. Along the way, we demonstrate how expectation values of conformal generators can help locate saddle points in large quantum number limits.</description>

      <title>Correlators for tensionless strings on ${\rm AdS}_3$ orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CFT dual of string theory on $({\rm AdS}_3 \times {\rm S}^3)/\mathbb{Z}_k\times \mathbb{T}^4$ is believed to be described by the subspace of the symmetric orbifold of $\mathbb{T}^4$ that comprises the low-lying excitations on top of a certain reference state. (This `non-perturbative' reference state lies in the twisted sector associated to the conjugacy class consisting of only $k$-cycles.) In a recent paper we confirmed this picture by analysing the worldsheet theory of the orbifold at the tensionless NS-NS point, and by showing that the perturbative worldsheet spectrum reproduces precisely the single particle excitations on top of this reference state. In this paper we explain that this identification also holds on the level of the correlators, at least to leading order in $1/N$.</description>

      <title>Classical scale-separated AdS$_3$ vacua in heterotic string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first scale-separated AdS solutions from compactifications of the heterotic string. Our solutions have parametrically weak coupling, large volume, and the internal KK scale is parametrically smaller than the AdS length. These AdS$_3$ vacua preserve $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and arise from compactifications on $G_2$ structure manifolds with $H$ flux and (smeared) gravitational instantons. All geometric moduli are stabilized, fluxes quantized, and the solutions are parametrically controlled in an appropriate large-flux limit.</description>

      <title>Schottky Anomaly of five-Dimensional de Sitter Hairy Spacetime based on effective thermodynamic quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking the mass, charge, hair parameter, and cosmological constant of the 5-dimensional de Sitter hairy spacetime as the state variables of a thermodynamic system, and based on the satisfaction of the universal first law of thermodynamics, we obtain the effective thermodynamic quantities of the spacetime. The thermodynamic properties of the system in the coexistence region of the black hole and cosmological horizons are discussed. We find that under certain conditions, the heat capacity of the effective thermodynamic system in the two-horizon coexistence region of de Sitter hairy spacetime, as a function of either temperature or the ratio of the horizon positions, exhibits a peak-like behavior similar to that observed in paramagnetic systems. Further analysis reveals that, under specific conditions, the heat capacity of this effective thermodynamic system in dS spacetime resembles that of a two-level system composed of two horizons with different radiation temperatures. By comparing these results, we derive the expressions for the number of microscopic particles on the two horizons within the coexistence region. This outcome reflects the quantum nature of dS spacetime and provides a new pathway for further in-depth investigation into the thermodynamic and quantum properties of the two-horizon coexistence region in dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Entropic Interpretation of Einstein Equation in dS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy, which is a non-Hermitian generalization of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), is equivalent to the perturbative Einstein equation in three-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space, assuming the dS/CFT correspondence. Our analysis reveals that the geodesic that accurately satisfies the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy consists of a timelike curve and a curve whose coordinates are complex. We also demonstrate that infinitesimal changes to the pseudo entropy satisfy a Klein-Gordon equation in two-dimensional de Sitter space. These imply the emergence of a time coordinate from a Euclidean CFT in dS/CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the nonvanishing spectral torsion functional of the internal part of the noncommutative geometry behind the Standard Model. We show that with a suitable modification of the usual differential graded calculus it matches an analogous functional constructed in terms of the connection. We study also the impact of the torsion on the other spectral fuctionals, which correspond to geometric invariants such as volume integral, metric and Einstein tensors, and scalar curvature. We discuss the impact of the SM Yukawa couplings and the Majorana mass matrix on our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide some up-to-date discussions related to cosmological event horizon and entropy of our universe, then introduce an intriguing idea that there may be a universal finite upper bound for entropy accessible to an observer in consistent theories of quantum gravity. We argue that the BMN (Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase) strings provide a test of the idea and a possible estimate of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Khovanov--Rozansky matrix factorization reduction for bipartite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) link polynomial is a certain $t$-deformation of Wilson loops in 3-dimensional $SU(N)$ Chern--Simons topological field theory, believed to be an observable in the refined Chern-Simons theory, probably described in terms of 4d or 5d QFT and related by a certain procedure to the triply-graded link superpolynomial. This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Spectrum of the Ising Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical framework to determine scaling dimensions of neutral composite operators in scalar conformal field theories. For the critical Ising $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$, we obtain the full spectrum of composite operators built out of $n$ fields transforming in the traceless-symmetric Lorentz representations to next-to-leading order in the double-scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with $\lambda n$ fixed. At any given order the semiclassical expansion resums an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $\epsilon$-expansion for the family of $\phi^n$ operators. Finally, in three dimensions the next-to-leading order semiclassical results supersede any other existing methodology for $n \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10)$.</description>

      <title>Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</description>

      <title>Macdonald Identities and Exact Formulas for Superconformal Indices in Super Yang-Mills Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact evaluations of superconformal indices for 4d N =1 and N =2 pure Super Yang-Mills theories with arbitrary simple gauge group G. Our approach applies the Macdonald identities for untwisted affine Lie algebras to the integral formulas of the indices, yielding uniform closed formulas valid for all G, expressed both as q-series and as eta-quotients, related through specialized Macdonald identities. Using similar techniques, we also derive exact expressions for half Schur indices with Neumann boundary conditions and uncover a bilinear structure of the full Schur index. Within the framework of holomorphic-topological twists, we further explore connections to the category of line operators, the K-theoretical Coulomb branch, Schur quantization, IR formulas for the BPS spectrum, and class S constructions.</description>

      <title>Line Defects with a Cusp in Fermionic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study line defects with a cusp in fermionic CFTs arising as fixed points of scalar-fermion theories with Yukawa interactions. These include the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and some of its generalizations with additional scalar fields, which can be thought of as UV completions of fermionic theories with quartic interactions. We compute the cusp anomalous dimension in these models to one-loop order in the epsilon expansion near four dimensions, and also to leading order in the large $N$ expansion in $2&lt;d&lt;4$. We discuss several observables that can be extracted from the cusp anomalous dimension, such as the dimensions of the defect changing and defect creation operators, the Casimir energy appearing in the fusion of defects, and the normalization coefficients of the two-point functions of displacement and tilt operators. We provide some estimates of the values of these observables in $d=3$ using the one-loop epsilon expansion and Pad\'e approximants.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Euclidean Two-point Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.</description>

      <title>QCD String Axions and $M$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory without matter, there exist stable long electric fluxtube strings which carry a 1-form symmetry charge. Over the past decade or so, there has been increasing evidence from lattice calculations that the worldsheet theories of such QCD strings contain a massive pseudoscalar (axion), at least when $N\geq 3$. This has so far been puzzling from the perspective of holographic realizations of strings in confining gauge theories. In this note, we will show how such axions appear naturally in the realization of 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) from $M$-theory spacetimes in which the extra dimensions are modeled by certain complete metrics of $G_2$-holonomy. This picture predicts that QCD string axions exist only if the gauge group is $SU(N\geq 3)$, $SO(4N+2)$, or $E_6$ (or a quotient/double-cover thereof), and is absent from the spectrum of stable QCD strings if the gauge group is $SU(2)$, $SO(2N+1)$, $SO(4N)$, $Sp(N)$, or $E_7$. We argue why we expect this pattern to persist for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills strings, at least for large $N$, something which could be tested in future lattice studies of QCD strings for gauge algebras of B, C, D, and E-type.</description>

      <title>Stable evolution of relativistic hydrodynamics order-by-order in gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework for solving the initial value problem for relativistic hydrodynamics formulated as a gradient expansion. Secular growth is handled by a suitable covariant resummation scheme, which reorganises the degrees of freedom at each order in the expansion while preserving the sum. Our scheme can be applied to any order in the gradient expansion; we provide the explicit formulation at first and second orders. When working to first order, we find that the BDNK equations of motion emerge as an intermediate step in a calculation performed in the Landau frame. We show that non-hydrodynamic modes appear only in such intermediate calculations and cancel when evaluating solutions to the required order. Our procedure does not introduce any other fields or require any additional initial data beyond those appearing in the theory of ideal fluids.</description>

      <title>Production of Gravitational Waves from Preheating and Tachyonic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze GW production during preheating for an $\alpha$-attractor potential terminating in the positive-curvature regime, with energy transfer via $\phi\chi^{2}$. Linear Floquet analysis and nonlinear simulations show that $\phi$ fluctuations grow by parametric resonance, while $\chi$ undergoes tachyonic bursts. The GW spectrum features two peaks: a dominant low-frequency peak from the parametric channel and a subdominant high-frequency peak from the tachyonic channel. Redshifted to today, the peak reaches $h^{2}\Omega_{\rm GW}^{(0)} \sim 10^{-11}$ at $f^{(0)}_{p} \sim 10^{7}$ Hz. This multi-peak structure is a characteristic imprint of trilinear preheating in $\alpha$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Killing (super)algebras for generalised spin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of a Killing (super)algebra for a connection on a spinor bundle associated to a generalised spin structure on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of any signature. We are led naturally to include in the even subspace not only Killing vectors but also certain infinitesimal gauge transformations, and we show that the definition of the (super)algebra requires, in addition to the spinor connection and a Dirac current, a map to pair spinor fields into infinitesimal gauge transformations. We show that these (super)algebras are filtered subdeformations of (an analogue of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra extended by the \(R\)-symmetry algebra. By employing Spencer cohomology, we study such deformations from a purely algebraic point of view and, at least in the case of Lorentzian signature and high supersymmetry, identify the subclass of deformations to which the Killing superalgebras belong. Finally, we show that, with some caveats, one can reconstruct a supersymmetric background geometry from such a deformation as a homogeneous space on which the deformation is realised as a subalgebra of the Killing superalgebra.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Mode Spectroscopy via Horizon-Brightened Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum optical framework for probing black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) using two-level atoms in the spirit of the horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) program. Starting from the QNM contribution to the Wightman function of a scalar field on a static, spherically symmetric black hole background, we derive the response function of a two-level Unruh--DeWitt detector following simple trajectories (static at fixed radius, with comments on radial free fall). The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts. We then treat a single dominant QNM as an effective non-Hermitian cavity mode coupled to an ensemble of driven two-level atoms, and derive a master equation of Dicke laser type. The resulting lasing threshold condition depends explicitly on the QNM damping rate, providing a direct quantum optical interpretation of the imaginary part of the QNM frequency. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry, we express the resonant frequencies, linewidths, and threshold in terms of photon-sphere data in the eikonal limit. We discuss several extensions and propose our framework as a unifying language connecting black hole ringdown, near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics, and quantum optics, thereby enriching the emerging program of black hole spectroscopy in the gravitational-wave era.</description>

Abstract: High-energy QCD evolution beyond leading order suffers from instabilities driven by large collinear logarithms. We present a framework, consistent with the standard high-energy operator product expansion (OPE), that restores perturbative stability order by order. The method involves a change of basis in the space of high-energy operators, which modifies both the evolution kernel and the coefficient functions while leaving physical observables invariant. Within this factorization scheme, we derive a next-to-leading-order renormalization-group equation whose numerical solution exhibits stable evolution up to large rapidities, thereby establishing a solid foundation for precision studies of gluon saturation at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Quantum Calculations of the Cavity Shift in Electron Magnetic Moment Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of the anomalous electron magnetic moment $g-2$ through quantum transitions of a single trapped electron is the most stringent test of quantum field theory. These experiments are now so precise that they must account for the effects of the cavity containing the electron. Classical calculations of this "cavity shift" must subtract the electron's divergent self-field, and thus require knowledge of the exact Green's function for the cavity's electromagnetic field. We perform the first fully quantum calculation of the cavity shift in a closed cavity, which instead involves subtracting linearly divergent cavity mode sums and integrals. Using contour integration methods, we find perfect agreement with existing classical results for both spherical and cylindrical cavities, justifying their current use. Moreover, our mode-based results can be naturally generalized to account for systematic effects, necessary to push future measurements to the next order of magnitude in precision.</description>

      <title>Unified Pati-Salam from Noncommutative Geometry: Overview and Phenomenological Remarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of clear new-physics signals at the LHC searches motivates models that can guide current and future collider searches. The spectral action principle within the noncommutative geometry (NCG) framework yields such models with distinctive phenomenology. This formalism derives the actions of the Standard Model, General Relativity, and beyond from the underlying algebra, putting them on a common geometric footing. Certain versions of Pati-Salam (PS) models with gauge coupling unification and limited scalar content can be derived from an appropriate noncommutative algebra. In this paper, I review these gauge-coupling-unified Pati-Salam models and discuss their phenomenological aspects, focusing on the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Stable Photon Sphere Advent on Orbital Precession in moving towards the Extremality: Periapsis Shift as a Gateway to the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the effects of solar mass change can be neglected in studies of solar periapsis shifts-given the relevant timescales and magnitude of change-the influence of a black hole's dynamic and chaotic mass variation on the Periapsis Shift of test particles in its surrounding spacetime demands a detailed and meticulous investigation. Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes.</description>

The classification of spacetime regions into causal and stable ("good"), acausal but stable ("bad"), and acausal and unstable ("ugly") is reviewed. We compare the predictions of the MUSIC hydrodynamic solver with an analytical solution, and demonstrate how the acausality-driven instabilities develop in a simple one-dimensional scenario.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dispersion over inhomogeneous space-times: General relativity, screened theories of gravity and non-minimal dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are direct probes of cosmological gravity, sensitive to space-time inhomogeneities along their propagation. The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\sim 50\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Good flavor search in $SU(5)$: a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the fermion mass problem of the $SU(5)$ grand unified theory using machine learning techniques. The original $SU(5)$ model proposed by Georgi and Glashow is incompatible with the observed fermion mass spectrum. Two remedies are known to resolve this discrepancy, one is through introducing a new interaction via a 45-dimensional field, and the other via a 24-dimensional field. We investigate which modification is more natural, defining naturalness as proximity to the original Georgi-Glashow $SU(5)$ model. Our analysis shows that, in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric scenarios, the model incorporating the interaction with the 24-dimensional field is more natural under this criterion. We then generalise these models by introducing a continuous parameter $y$, which takes the value 3 for the 45-dimensional field and 1.5 for the 24-dimensional field. Numerical optimisation reveals that $y \approx 0.8$ yields the closest match to the original $SU(5)$ model, indicating that this value corresponds to the most natural model according to our definition.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified categorical framework which encodes gauging of continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimension. We show that electric symmetry breaking, resulting from the addition of charged matter, is implemented by this gauging procedure, and identify electric and magnetic symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. We work with geometric categories, i.e. categories internal to stacks. This allows us to extend (de)equivariantization of fusion categories to continuous groups, construct a functorial SymTFT and boundaries for this theory, and compute the relevant categories of endomorphisms and Drinfeld centers.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Possibility of a Sharp Phase Transition in Cold Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in cold neutron stars (NSs) have been extensively studied and have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the densest matter visible in our Universe, although a strong consensus has yet to emerge. Revisiting the possibility of a hadron-quark FOPT from a new perspective, we examine the interplay between the coupled nature of gravity and microscopic interactions in Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and the fundamental requirements of thermodynamic consistency in NSs. We demonstrate that a sharp FOPT manifested as a plateau in the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$, i.e., pressure $P$ versus energy density $\varepsilon$, is intrinsically incompatible with the regularity conditions of the TOV solutions. Although numerical integrations of the TOV equations with EOSs incorporating FOPTs may yield seemingly reasonable mass-radius relations consistent with current observations, such results can mask underlying inconsistencies. Our analysis thus establishes a structural consistency criterion for constraining dense-matter EOSs using NS observables, complementing existing studies of possible phase transitions in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of particles around a dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Poincar\'{e} section, fast Lyapunov indicator, recurrence analysis, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction to investigate the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles around a new dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe presented in [A. Di Pinto, S. Klemm, and A. Vigan\`o, J. High Energy Phys. {\bf 06}, 150 (2025)]. We note that the swirling parameter $j$ and magnetic field strength $B$ make the equations of motion for particles nonseparable, and confirm the presence of chaotic behavior in the motion in this dyonic Kerr-Newman-Melvin-swirling spacetime and its sub-cases by removing the conical singularities and removing both the conical singularities and the Dirac strings. We observe that both the number of chaotic orbits and the chaotic region increase with the increase of the parameters $j$ and $B$, but decrease as the electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $H$ or spin parameter $a$ increases. Moreover, we find that the presence of $j$ changes the ranges of $B$, $Q$, $H$ and $a$ where the chaotic motion appears for particles. The swirling parameter together with the magnetic field strength, electric charge, magnetic charge and spin parameter yields richer physics in the motion of particles for the spacetime of a dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Wave Memory : Universal Low-Frequency Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal contribution exists in the infrared (low frequency) regime of all gravitational waves, which results from nonlinear memory. Nonlinear memory is sourced by linear order gravitational waves and exists for any gravitational-wave background. We calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signal of various stochastic backgrounds of cosmological (scalar induced, reheating, phase transition, topological defect, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of stellar-mass, intermediate mass, supermassive, and primordial black holes) origins. These results allow us to derive the complete frequency spectrum of cosmological and astrophysical SGWB. We calculate how to probe the thermal state of the universe, i.e. the equation of the state, via the memory spectrum's slope and also discuss the detection prospects at various frequency bands with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Metastable Strings and Gravitational Waves in One-Scale Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole-antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, and verify that the thin-defect approximation remains valid throughout the phenomenologically favoured region, without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish, for each orbifold crepantly resolving a Kleinian singularity, the existence of the cohomological Hall algebra (COHA) of coherent sheaves supported on the exceptional locus and explicitly compute this COHA as a completion of some positive half of the associated affine Yangian. Tracking these categories under derived autoequivalences and the McKay correspondence, we show that (1) every point in Bridgeland's space of stability conditions on the resolution arises from a Kleinian orbifold, and (2) every positive half of the affine Yangian can be recovered from the COHA associated to some such stability condition. This provides the first example of a family of (pointwise) COHAs defined over the space of stability conditions.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several important general structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds we have seen hints of concrete $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ representations underlying the different $\hat Z$-invariants of the given manifolds. At the same time, these invariants appear to only span a subspace of the representation, and the role of the latter remains mysterious. We elucidate the meaning of the modular group representation, realized as vector-valued quantum modular forms, by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form for $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants of a given three-manifold, when the newly defined defects $\hat Z$-invariants are included. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for three three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these mock invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <title>Multipoint conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Part I: Bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approach to calculating $n$-point one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions which we call the reconstruction procedure. It relies on decomposing a conformal integral over basis functions which are generated from a set of master functions by acting with the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. In order to identify the master functions we introduce a bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation by means of splitting a given conformal integral into two additive parts, one of which can be evaluated explicitly in terms of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series.
  For the box and pentagon integrals (i.e. $n=4,5$) we show that a computable part of the bipartite representation contains all master functions. In particular, this allows us to evaluate the parametric pentagon integral as a sum of ten basis functions generated from two master functions by the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_5$. The resulting expression can be tested in two ways. First, when one of propagator powers is set to zero, the pentagon integral is reduced to the known box integral, which is also rederived through the reconstruction procedure. Second, going to the non-parametric case, we reproduce the known expression for the pentagon integral given in terms of logarithms derived earlier within the geometric approach to calculating conformal integrals.
  We conclude by considering the hexagon integral ($n=6$) for which we show that those basis functions which follow from the computable part of the bipartite representation are not enough and more basis functions are required. In the second part of our project we will describe a method of constructing a complete set of master/basis functions in the $n$-point case.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative resolutions and CICY quotients from a non-abelian GLSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a one-parameter non-abelian GLSM with gauge group $(U(1)\times U(1)\times U(1))\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_3$ and its associated Calabi-Yau phases. The large volume phase is a free $\mathbb{Z}_3$-quotient of a codimension $3$ complete intersection of degree-$(1,1,1)$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. The associated Calabi-Yau differential operator has a second point of maximal unipotent monodromy, leading to the expectation that the other GLSM phase is geometric as well. However, the associated GLSM phase appears to be a hybrid model with continuous unbroken gauge symmetry and cubic superpotential, together with a Coulomb branch. Using techniques from topological string theory and mirror symmetry we collect evidence that the phase should correspond to a non-commutative resolution, in the sense of Katz-Klemm-Schimannek-Sharpe, of a codimension two complete intersection in weighted projective space with $63$ nodal points, for which a resolution has $\mathbb{Z}_3$-torsion. We compute the associated Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to genus $11$, incorporating their torsion refinement. We identify two integral symplectic bases constructed from topological data of the mirror geometries in either phase.</description>

Abstract: We investigate (-1)-form symmetries using the framework of symmetry topological field theories. Previous studies of (-1)-form symmetries have primarily focused on SymTFTs with topological point operators. Here we examine SymTFTs devoid of point operators, constructed to realize zero-form symmetries of some physical theory. In this context we identify codimension-one defects within the bulk of SymTFT constructed via higher gauging which can be interpreted as the generators of the (-1)-form symmetry of the absolute theory. In addition, we present examples where (-1)-form symmetries exhibit the novel ability to shift the 't Hooft anomalies of the theory.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions compactified on the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, starting from the mirror pair of Batyrev lattices corresponding to a given CY manifold, we construct vertex operators of the complete physical theory as cohomology of Borisov differentials that correspond to points of reflexive Batyrev polyhedra. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an infinite family of semiclassical de Sitter (dS) microstates, realized as backreacted geometries of dS spacetime with a constant tension thin-shell brane located outside the dS event horizon. We further show that wormhole contributions to the semiclassical Euclidean gravitational path integral lead to universal nonperturbative overlaps between these microstates. By evaluating the nonperturbative overlaps, we count the dimension of the Hilbert space spanned by the semiclassical dS microstates and find that it precisely equals the exponential of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of dS spacetime. Our construction thus provides a state-counting derivation for Gibbons-Hawking entropy of dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Scale without conformal invariance from integrable deformations of coset CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the $\lambda$-model on $SU(3)_k/U(2)_k$ and we compute the one-loop $\beta$-function for the deformation parameter $\lambda$. Its non-compact version for $SU(2,1)_{-k}/U(2)_{-k}$ is also considered, whose target space admits an asymptotic region that can be reached when one of the coordinates becomes large. The asymptotic model can be seen as an integrable deformation of the $SU(2)_k/U(1)$ WZW model together with a linear dilaton and a free boson, where integrability is inherited from the parental $\lambda$-model. By taking an asymptotic double-scaling limit of the $SU(2,1)_{-k}/U(2)_{-k}$ model, we obtain a two-dimensional field theory that is scale-invariant but not conformally invariant at one-loop order. Crucially, this deformation does not admit a Kerr-Schild form, unlike the cases studied in arXiv:2109.05040. However, in a suitable asymptotic regime, scale invariance is enhanced to full conformal invariance. Finally, we construct Type-II supergravity embeddings of the asymptotic model for specific values of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Criticality of Noncommutative RN-AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by string theory topics, we investigate the Reissner Nordstrom AdS black holes in noncommutative spacetime with Lorentzian smeared distributions. Concretely, we study certain thermodynamic properties including the criticality behaviors by computing the relevant quantities. For large radius approximations, we first derive the asymptotic expansions of the mass and charge functions appearing in the metric function of such black holes. Then, we approach the thermodynamics in the extended phase space. After the stability discussion, we examine the P V criticality in noncommutative geometry by calculating the corresponding thermodynamic quantities. As a result, we show that the proposed black holes exhibit certain similarities with Van der Waals fluid systems. Finally, we present a discussion on the Joule Thomson expansion showing perfect universality results appearing in charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Branes and Antibranes in AdS$_3$: The Impossible States in the CFT Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of type IIB supergravity solutions corresponding to states of the D1-D5-P-KKm system that carry the same charges and energy as the non-extremal four-charge black hole and are asymptotic to AdS$_3 \times ($S$^3/\mathbb{Z}_{N_k}) \times$ T$^4$. The solutions consist of static binaries of two extremal D1-D5-P black holes with S$^3$ horizons and charges of opposite signs, held in equilibrium by a topological bubble supporting $N_k$ units of KKm charge. Although dynamically unstable, the spacetimes remain smooth on and outside the horizons. The equilibrium condition discretizes the black hole separation, producing a quantized spectrum labeled by the number of antibranes and antimomenta at the anti-BPS center. Strikingly, the lowest-energy states lie within an energy window smaller than the dual CFT mass gap. We also show that these solutions admit regular finite-temperature deformations, which slightly lift the two black holes above extremality while remaining within the gap. These results challenge the expectation that no states exist within the CFT gap, realizing \emph{impossible states}. We discuss two possible resolutions. First, Schwarzian-type quantum corrections could lift these solutions above the gap. Alternatively, though less likely, higher-genus corrections to the two-dimensional effective super-JT theory allow a sparse spectrum of exponentially suppressed states within the gap. In either case, our construction provides explicit realization of a dense set of intricate, highly non-perturbative, low-energy excited states of holographic CFTs.</description>

      <title>Holography of K-complexity: Switchbacks and Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study Krylov complexity in the presence of single and multiple operators in the DSSYK model, where we can use the analytical techniques coming from chord diagrammatics. One of the results we obtain is that it showcases the switchback effect, when the appropriate ``triple-scaling limit'' is taken, under which the model becomes dual to semiclassical JT gravity. We build on previous work, where it was shown that, in the continuum limit, Krylov complexity is defined as the sum of expectations value of right and left chord number operators. Here we argue that this property signals the emergence of the geometric nature of this notion of K-complexity. We show that in the regime where DSSYK is dual to semi-classical gravity, the light matter chord corresponds to a shockwave insertion in JT gravity. We identify the geodesic-length dual of the operator complexity and extend the relevant holographic dictionary to describe the details of the matter insertions. Additionally, we define a class of two-sided perturbations of the Lanczos algorithm that allows to analyze the switchback effect. In the appropriate semi-classical limit, this perturbed operator complexity is dual to an ERB length in JT gravity with corresponding shockwave insertions. We thus establish that K-complexity exhibits the expected switchback effect and universal late-time linear growth, consistent with previous findings regarding its geometric nature in the holographic bulk-boundary map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.</description>

Abstract: We study the nearly critical behaviour of holographic superfluids at finite temperature and chemical potential. Using analytic techniques in the bulk, we derive an effective theory for the long wavelength dynamics of gapless and pseudo-gapped modes, at first subleading order in a derivative expansion and we match the classical limit of our field theory construction in a companion paper. Specifically, we obtain the constitutive relations for the stress tensor and electric current, as well as a time evolution equation for the order parameter at next-to-leading order. In addition, we get explicit formulas for all the transport coefficients in terms of background quantities. We carry out numerical cross-checks with the predictions of our effective theory close to the critical point.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Relative Entropy to the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide arguments indicating that the semiclassical Einstein equations follow from quantum relative entropy and its proportionality to an area variation. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a central role in what is often seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I define topological twists of supersymmetric field theories in the case when the supercharges involved obey an ``open'' algebra. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky field-antifield formalism, I construct twisted theories algorithmically from the supersymmetry data, and explain supersymmetric localisation in terms of anticanonical transformations. I also treat equivariant topological twists and explain how BV observables contain the equivariant cohomology of the space of histories. Some results are generalised to theories with two topological supercharges -- such as the ``balanced'' topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Moore -- using the geometry of ``differential gorms'' of Kochan and \v{S}evera. Finally, I exhibit examples of these constructions, including a $\mathrm{U}(1)$-equivariant topological B-model.</description>

Abstract: We construct and study a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model with a single $U(N)$ adjoint fermionic matrix. The model is exactly solvable yet contains a large number of fortuitous states. We investigate these states exactly at finite $N$ and, in the large $N$ limit, via a unitary matrix model. In particular, we develop a way to "follow $N$" in the unitary matrix integral and study how the answer of the integral depends sensitively on the value of $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using holographic realizations of the Araki-Lieb (AL) inequality, we show that typical pure states in large-N holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) possess two characteristic length scales determined solely by energy and conserved charges: a microscopic L_UV and an infrared L_IR &gt; L_UV. Degrees of freedom between these scales effectively factorize -- one purifying the ultraviolet (scales &lt; L_UV) and the other the infrared sector (scales &gt; L_IR). Remarkably, the pure-state factor including the ultraviolet sector is determined solely by energy and conserved charges up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Our results imply that all black holes in anti-de Sitter space can be isolated from an asymptotic region, the "corona", formed by the inclusion of entanglement wedges for which the AL inequality is saturated, and that an effective factorization emerges in the buffer region between the corona and the outer horizon.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the scattering of gravitino wave in a Schwarzschild gravitational field. Employing the simulating wave function method within the framework of perturbative techniques, we derive the differential scattering cross section for the gravitino wave in the long-wavelength limit. It is proven that the cross section of gravitino wave follows the same spin-dependent pattern as those of scalar, neutrino, and electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Grassmann tensor renormalization group method to investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $\theta$ term in a broad range of mass. The method allows us to deal with the massive staggered fermions straightforwardly and to study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy and topological charge in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical solution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in the small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in the continuum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new construction of vertex algebras using the Deligne category. This approach provides a rigorous framework for defining the so-called large $N$ vertex algebra, which has appeared in recent physics literatures. We first define the notion of a vertex algebra in a symmetric monoidal category and extend familiar constructions in ordinary vertex algebras to this broader categorical context. As an application, we consider a $\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra in the Deligne category and construct the large N vertex algebra from it. We study some simple properties of this vertex algebra and analyze a certain vertex Poisson algebra limit.</description>

Abstract: We present semi-analytical solutions for the evolution of both the temperature and chemical potentials for viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges. Such a solution can be especially useful in testing numerical codes intended to simulate relativistic fluids with large chemical potentials. The freeze-out hypersurface profiles for constant energy density are calculated, along with the corresponding normal vectors and presented as a new unit test for numerical codes. We also compare the influence of the equation of state on the semi-analytical solutions. We benchmark the newly developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code CCAKE that includes both shear viscosity and three conserved charges. The numerical solutions are in excellent agreement with the semi-analytical solution and also are able to accurately reproduce the hypersurface at freeze-out.</description>

      <title>A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three- dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena. The computed scaling dimensions agree well with known non-perturbative results, and they lead to new predictions where such results do not yet exist. We thereby expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between gapped phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between a gapped phase in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and a phase where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We characterize the possible patterns of symmetry fractionalization in these phases and provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits the transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>

Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Elliptic Curves via Elliptic Gromov-Witten Invariants of Four Dimensional Projective Fano Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a conjecture that clarifies the relationship between the number of degree d elliptic curves in complex four-dimensional projective Fano hypersurfaces and their degree d elliptic Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants. The elliptic GW invariants are computed using the elliptic virtual structure constants proposed in our previous works.</description>

      <title>Warped Dimensions at the Cosmological Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extra dimensions are present in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, most notably in string theory. However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Ringdown in Vaidya spacetimes: time-dependent frequencies, Penrose limit and time-domain analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative dyonic black holes sourced by nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first-order noncommutative (NC) corrections to the general nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) Lagrangian depending on two electromagnetic invariants. The NC deformation of Einstein-NLE theory is implemented using the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfel'd twist and the NC effects are encoded in the matter sector through the Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting equations of motion reflect two distinct sources of nonlinearity in this framework; one arising from replacing Maxwell's electrodynamics with its nonlinear modifications and another from the NC deformations. Assuming a general form of static, spherically symmetric dyonic black hole as a seed solution in the commutative limit, we solve the equations of motion perturbatively to the first order in the NC parameter $a$. Finally, we evaluate the obtained corrections to the metric tensor and gauge potential for several prominent NLE theories.</description>
