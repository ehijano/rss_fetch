      <title>Expregular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyregular functions form a robust class of string-to-string functions with polynomial growth, as evidenced by Bojanczyk (2018).
  This class admits numerous descriptions and enjoys several closure properties.
  Most notably, polyregular functions are regularity reflecting (\ie the inverse image of a regular language is regular).
  In this work, we propose a robust class of string-to-string functions with exponential growth which we call expregular functions. We consider the following three models for describing them:
  - MSO set interpretations, which extend MSO interpretations (one of the models capturing polyregular functions), by operating on monadic variables instead of tuples of first-order variables;
  - yield-Hennie machines, which are branching one-tape Turing machines with bounded visit; and
  - Ariadne transducers, a new model of 2-way pushdown machines with a bounded visit restriction.
  Our main contribution is a translation from MSO set interpretations to yield-Hennie machines, which are known to be regularity reflecting (Dartois, Nguy\~{\^{e}}n, Peyrat 2026).
  In particular this establishes that MSO set interpretations are regularity reflecting, which in turn settles a major conjecture about automatic structures: every automatic $\omega$-word has a decidable MSO theory.
  Yield-Hennie machine directly translate to Ariadne transducers, and our second contribution is to prove that Ariadne transducers also translate to MSO set interpretations, thus establishing the equivalence of the three models. This is obtained by showing that Ariadne automata -- the automaton model corresponding to Ariadne transducers -- recognise regular languages.</description>

      <title>Automata Learning with an Incomplete but Inductive Teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active automata learning (AAL) under a Minimally Adequate Teacher (MAT) has been successfully used to infer a regular language through membership and equivalence queries. This language might not be fully characterized: we are then interested in finding any solution in a target class of possibly many regular languages. Some problems such as regular language separation or inductive invariant synthesis in the context of regular model checking (RMC) may indeed admit more than one answer. We therefore introduce IdMAT: a new teacher formalism answering queries with respect to any language in the target class, all at once. Such a teacher tailored towards invariant synthesis might provide incomplete "don't know" answers, but also inductive facts of the form "if w1 is accepted, so is w2". We pair IdMAT with a novel AAL algorithm LIndA that 1. encodes all uncertainties as a unique SAT instance and does not fork, 2. leverages incremental SAT solving and UNSAT core analysis, and 3. handles counterexamples of the simple or inductive type in a frugal manner inspired by the Rivest-Schapire refinement technique. We finally evaluate a prototype implementation in the context of regular language separation and RMC.</description>

      <title>Repetition Threshold for Binary Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical exponent of an infinite word $\bf x$ is the supremum, over all finite nonempty factors $f$, of the exponent of $f$. In this note we show that for all integers $k\geq 2,$ there is a binary infinite $k$-automatic sequence with critical exponent $\leq 7/3$. The same conclusion holds for Fibonacci-automatic and Tribonacci-automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>Embedding arbitrary Boolean circuits into fungal automata with arbitrary update sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sandpile automata of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld (Phys. Rev. Lett., 1987) are a simple model for the diffusion of particles in space. A fundamental problem related to the complexity of the model is predicting its evolution in the parallel setting. Despite decades of effort, a classification of this problem for two-dimensional sandpile automata remains outstanding. Fungal automata were recently proposed by Goles et al. (Phys. Lett. A, 2020) as a spin-off of the model in which diffusion occurs either in horizontal $(H)$ or vertical $(V)$ directions according to a so-called update scheme. Goles et al. proved that the prediction problem for this model with the update scheme $H^4V^4$ is $\textbf{P}$-complete. This result was subsequently improved by Modanese and Worsch (Algorithmica, 2024), who showed the problem is $\textbf{P}$-complete also for the simpler updatenscheme $HV$. In this work, we fill in the gaps and prove that the prediction problem is $\textbf{P}$-complete for any update scheme that contains both $H$ and $V$ at least once.</description>
