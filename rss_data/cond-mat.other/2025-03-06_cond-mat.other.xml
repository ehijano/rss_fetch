      <title>Nitrogen and hydrogen intercalation into crystalline fullerite C$_{60}$ and photoluminescent studies in a wide temperature range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of fullerite C$_{60}$ single crystals saturated with hydrogen and nitrogen molecules were studied in the temperature range from 20 K to 230 K using the spectral-luminescent method. Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.</description>

      <title>Collective neutral excitations as sensitive probe for the quality of 2D charge carrier systems in ultra-pure GaAs quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-clean low-dimensional interacting charge carrier systems are the basis to explore correlated states and phases. We report the observation of very narrow collective intersubband excitations (ISBE) of 2D electron systems (2DESs) with ultra-high mobilities in high quality GaAs quantum well structures. These findings from resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) experiments are used as tools for exploration of links between transport mobility and collective electron behavior in 2DES of high perfection. We find that the linewidths of collective ISBE modes can be very narrow with values smaller than 80{\mu}eV. Comparison of ISBE measurements from several high-mobility samples exhibits a variation in linewidth of more than a factor of two. There is, however, a surprising lack of direct correlation between ISBE linewidth with mobility in the range 15x10^6 cm^2/Vs&lt;{\mu}&lt;24x10^6 cm^2/Vs. ISBE by RILS are discussed as a sensitive probe to characterize the interacting electron systems for fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) studies.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable band-edge in few-layer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant research interest due to the variation in band-edge locations within the hexagonal Brillouin zone between single-layer and bulk configurations. In monolayers, the conduction band minima are centered at the $K$-points, whereas in multilayers, they shift to the $Q$-points, midway between the $\Gamma$ and $K$ points. In this study, we conduct magnetotransport experiments to measure the occupation in the $Q$ and $K$ valleys in fourlayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$). We demonstrate electrostatic tunability of the conduction band edge by combining our experimental results with a hybrid $k\cdot p$ tight-binding model that accounts for interlayer screening effects in a self-consistent manner. Furthermore, we extend our model to bilayer and trilayer MoS$_2$, reconciling prior experimental results and quantifying the tunable range of band edges in atomically thin TMDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-particle density matrix of a one-dimensional system of fermions featuring a hard-core repulsive interaction at short distances can be computed (numerically) exactly by means of the continuous-space Worm Algorithm, without any sign instability. We present here results for this quantity, and the related momentum distribution, for a helium-three fluid. It is shown that effects of quantum statistics are observable in the fully polarized system, but are suppressed in the unpolarized one, atoms being essentially distinguishable in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, an extension of dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. Remarkably, we demonstrate that such systems may amplify both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that plasmonic time crystals support \emph{collective resonances} of longitudinal modes, which occur independently of the wave vector $k$, even in the presence of significant dissipation. These resonances originate from the coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma ($\varepsilon$-near zero) frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance arises at a modulation frequency $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, corresponding to a direct interband transition. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles and provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the weak modulation limit. Furthermore, we propose transparent conducting oxides as promising platforms for realizing plasmonic time crystals, as they enable significant modulation of the electron effective mass while maintaining moderate dissipation levels. Our findings provide new insights into leveraging time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain and control wave dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Characterizing dynamical behaviors in topological open systems with boundary dissipations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with boundary dissipations described by Lindblad master equations and unravel distinct dynamical features in the topologically different phases of the underlying Hamiltonian. By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.</description>
