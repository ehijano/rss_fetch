      <title>Likelihood Scouting Via Map Inversion For A Posterior-Sampled Particle Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exploit of the Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) algorithm using Differential Algebra (DA) techniques is derived to develop an efficient particle filter. The filter creates an original kind of particles, called scout particles, that bring information from the measurement noise onto the state prior probability density function. Thanks to the creation of high-order polynomial maps and their inversions, the scouting of the measurements helps the SIS algorithm identify the region of the prior more affected by the likelihood distribution. The result of the technique is two different versions of the proposed Scout Particle Filter (SPF), which identifies and delimits the region where the true posterior probability has high density in the SIS algorithm. Four different numerical applications show the benefits of the methodology both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, where the SPF is compared to other particle filters, with a particular focus on target tracking and orbit determination problems.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Models for High Dimensional Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along with the prosperity of generative artificial intelligence (AI), its potential for solving conventional challenges in wireless communications has also surfaced. Inspired by this trend, we investigate the application of the advanced diffusion models (DMs), a representative class of generative AI models, to high dimensional wireless channel estimation. By capturing the structure of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels via a deep generative prior encoded by DMs, we develop a novel posterior inference method for channel reconstruction. We further adapt the proposed method to recover channel information from low-resolution quantized measurements. Additionally, to enhance the over-the-air viability, we integrate the DM with the unsupervised Stein's unbiased risk estimator to enable learning from noisy observations and circumvent the requirements for ground truth channel data that is hardly available in practice. Results reveal that the proposed estimator achieves high-fidelity channel recovery while reducing estimation latency by a factor of 10 compared to state-of-the-art schemes, facilitating real-time implementation. Moreover, our method outperforms existing estimators while reducing the pilot overhead by half, showcasing its scalability to ultra-massive antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Physical Layer Security: From Far-Field to Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secrecy performance in both near-field and far-field communications is analyzed using two fundamental metrics: the secrecy capacity under a power constraint and the minimum power requirement to achieve a specified secrecy rate target. 1) For the secrecy capacity, a closed-form expression is derived under a discrete-time memoryless setup. This expression is further analyzed under several far-field and near-field channel models, and the capacity scaling law is revealed by assuming an infinitely large transmit array and an infinitely high power. A novel concept of "depth of insecurity" is proposed to evaluate the secrecy performance achieved by near-field beamfocusing. It is demonstrated that increasing the number of transmit antennas reduces this depth and thus improves the secrecy performance. 2) Regarding the minimum required power, a closed-form expression is derived and analyzed within far-field and near-field scenarios. Asymptotic analyses are performed by setting the number of transmit antennas to infinity to unveil the power scaling law. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i) compared to far-field communications, near-field communications expand the areas where secure transmission is feasible, specifically when the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the intended receiver; ii) as the number of transmit antennas increases, neither the secrecy capacity nor the minimum required power scales or vanishes unboundedly, adhering to the principle of energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Mid-Band Extra Large-Scale MIMO System: Channel Modeling and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of enhanced quality of service and higher transmission rates, communication within the mid-band spectrum, such as bands in the 6-15 GHz range, combined with extra large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), is considered a potential enabler for future communication systems. However, the characteristics introduced by mid-band XL-MIMO systems pose challenges for channel modeling and performance analysis. In this paper, we first analyze the potential characteristics of mid-band MIMO channels. Then, an analytical channel model incorporating novel channel characteristics is proposed, based on a review of classical analytical channel models. This model is convenient for theoretical analysis and compatible with other analytical channel models. Subsequently, based on the proposed channel model, we analyze key metrics of wireless communication, including the ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) and outage probability (OP) of MIMO maximal-ratio combining systems. Specifically, we derive closed-form approximations and performance bounds for two typical scenarios, aiming to illustrate the influence of mid-band XL-MIMO systems. Finally, comparisons between systems under different practical configurations are carried out through simulations. The theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that mid-band XL-MIMO systems excel in SE and OP due to the increased array elements, moderate large-scale fading, and enlarged transmission bandwidth.</description>

      <title>An Achievable Rate-Distortion Region of Joint Identification and Sensing for Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) experiences doubly exponential growth with the block length when randomized encoding is used. Additional enhancements within the ID paradigm can be realized through supplementary resources such as quantum entanglement, common randomness (CR), and feedback. Joint transmission and sensing demonstrate significant benefits over separation-based methods. Inspired by the significant impact of feedback on the ID capacity, our work delves into the realm of joint ID and sensing (JIDAS) for state-dependent multiple access channels (SD-MACs) with noiseless strictly casual feedback. Here, the senders aim to convey ID messages to the receiver while simultaneously sensing the channel states. We establish a lower bound on the capacity-distortion region of the SD-MACs. An example shows that JIDAS outperforms the separation-based approach.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning with Representations: Contextual Generalization of Trained Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) refers to a remarkable capability of pretrained large language models, which can learn a new task given a few examples during inference. However, theoretical understanding of ICL is largely under-explored, particularly whether transformers can be trained to generalize to unseen examples in a prompt, which will require the model to acquire contextual knowledge of the prompt for generalization. This paper investigates the training dynamics of transformers by gradient descent through the lens of non-linear regression tasks. The contextual generalization here can be attained via learning the template function for each task in-context, where all template functions lie in a linear space with $m$ basis functions. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer multi-head transformers to in-contextly predict unlabeled inputs given partially labeled prompts, where the labels contain Gaussian noise and the number of examples in each prompt are not sufficient to determine the template. Under mild assumptions, we show that the training loss for a one-layer multi-head transformer converges linearly to a global minimum. Moreover, the transformer effectively learns to perform ridge regression over the basis functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first provable demonstration that transformers can learn contextual (i.e., template) information to generalize to both unseen examples and tasks when prompts contain only a small number of query-answer pairs.</description>

      <title>SDP bounds on quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a semidefinite programming hierarchy based on state polynomial optimization to determine the existence of quantum codes with given parameters. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that if a $(\!(n,K,\delta)\!)_2$ code does not exist then a level of the hierarchy is infeasible. It is not limited to stabilizer codes and thus applicable generally. While it is formally dimension-free, we restrict it to qubit codes through quasi-Clifford algebras. We derive the quantum analog of a range of classical results: first, from an intermediate level a Lov\'asz bound for self-dual quantum codes is recovered. Second, a symmetrization of a minor variation of this Lov\'asz bound recovers the quantum Delsarte bound. Third, a symmetry reduction using the Terwilliger algebra leads to semidefinite programming bounds of size $O(n^4)$. With this we give an alternative proof that there is no $(\!(7,1,4)\!)_2$ quantum code, and show that $(\!(8,9,3)\!)_2$ and $(\!(10,5,4)\!)_2$ codes do not exist.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms and Implementations for Computing the Minimum Distance of Quantum Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distance of a stabilizer quantum code is a very important feature since it determines the number of errors that can be detected and corrected. We present three new fast algorithms and implementations for computing the symplectic distance of the associated classical code. Our new algorithms are based on the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm. Our experimental study shows that these new implementations are much faster than current state-of-the-art licensed implementations on single-core processors, multicore processors, and shared-memory multiprocessors. In the most computationally-demanding cases, the performance gain in the computational time can be larger than one order of magnitude. The experimental study also shows a good scalability on shared-memory parallel architectures.</description>

      <title>Hardware Implementation of Projection-Aggregation Decoders for Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the hardware implementation of two variants of projection-aggregation-based decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, namely unique projection aggregation (UPA) and collapsed projection aggregation (CPA). Our study focuses on introducing hardware architectures for both UPA and CPA. Through thorough analysis and experimentation, we observe that the hardware implementation of UPA exhibits superior resource usage and reduced energy consumption compared to CPA for the vanilla IPA decoder. This finding underscores a critical insight: software optimizations, in isolation, may not necessarily translate into hardware cost-effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Robust Regression with Ensembles Communicating over Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine-learning models grow in size, their implementation requirements cannot be met by a single computer system. This observation motivates distributed settings, in which intermediate computations are performed across a network of processing units, while the central node only aggregates their outputs. However, distributing inference tasks across low-precision or faulty edge devices, operating over a network of noisy communication channels, gives rise to serious reliability challenges. We study the problem of an ensemble of devices, implementing regression algorithms, that communicate through additive noisy channels in order to collaboratively perform a joint regression task. We define the problem formally, and develop methods for optimizing the aggregation coefficients for the parameters of the noise in the channels, which can potentially be correlated. Our results apply to the leading state-of-the-art ensemble regression methods: bagging and gradient boosting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial alphabet-dependent bounds for insdel codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes resilient to synchronization errors such as insertions and deletions are known as insdel codes. Due to their important applications in DNA storage and computational biology, insdel codes have recently become a focal point of research in coding theory.
  In this paper, we present several new combinatorial upper and lower bounds on the maximum size of $q$-ary insdel codes. Our main upper bound is a sphere-packing bound obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. It improves upon previous results for cases when the distance $d$ or the alphabet size $q$ is large. Our first lower bound is derived from a connection between insdel codes and matchings in special hypergraphs. This lower bound, together with our upper bound, shows that for fixed block length $n$ and edit distance $d$, when $q$ is sufficiently large, the maximum size of insdel codes is $ \frac{q^{n-\frac{d}{2}+1}}{{n\choose \frac{d}{2}-1}}(1 \pm o(1))$. The second lower bound refines Alon et al.'s recent logarithmic improvement on Levenshtein's GV-type bound and extends its applicability to large $q$ and $d$.</description>

      <title>Distributed Precoding for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks Without Sharing CSIT: A Rate-Splitting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are promising architecture for providing global coverage. In STINs, full frequency reuse between a satellite and a terrestrial base station (BS) is encouraged for aggressive spectrum reuse, which induces non-negligible amount of interference. To address the interference management problem in STINs, this paper proposes a novel distributed precoding method. Key features of our method are: i) a rate-splitting (RS) strategy is incorporated for efficient interference management and ii) the precoders are designed in a distributed way without sharing channel state information between a satellite and a terrestrial BS. Specifically, to design the precoders in a distributed fashion, we put forth a spectral efficiency decoupling technique, that disentangles the total spectral efficiency function into two distinct terms, each of which is dependent solely on the satellite's precoder and the terrestrial BS's precoder, respectively. Then, to resolve the non-smoothness raised by the RS strategy, we approximate the spectral efficiency expression as a smooth function by using the LogSumExp technique; thereafter we develop a generalized power iteration inspired optimization algorithm built based on the first-order optimality condition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers considerable spectral efficiency gains compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Indirect Lossy Source Coding with Observed Source Reconstruction: Nonasymptotic Bounds and Second-Order Asymptotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the joint compression of a pair of correlated sources, where the encoder is allowed to access only one of the sources. The objective is to recover both sources under separate distortion constraints for each source while minimizing the rate. This problem generalizes the indirect lossy source coding problem by also requiring the recovery of the observed source. In this paper, we aim to study the nonasymptotic and second-order asymptotic properties of this problem. Specifically, we begin by deriving nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds valid for general sources and distortion measures. The source dispersion (Gaussian approximation) is then determined through asymptotic analysis of the nonasymptotic bounds. We further examine the case of erased fair coin flips (EFCF) and provide its specific nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds. Numerical results under the EFCF case demonstrate that our second-order asymptotic approximation closely approximates the optimum rate at appropriately large blocklengths.</description>

Abstract: The concept of emergence, or synergy in its simplest form, is widely used but lacks a rigorous definition. Our work connects information and set theory to uncover the mathematical nature of synergy as the failure of distributivity. It resolves the persistent self-contradiction of information decomposition theory and reinstates it as a primary route toward a rigorous definition of emergence. Our results suggest that non-distributive variants of set theory may be used to describe emergent physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06624v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) human exposure from base stations, international standards bodies define EMF emission requirements that can be translated into limits on the "actual" Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), i.e., averaged over a sliding time window. We aim to enable base stations to adhere to these constraints while mitigating any impact on user performance. Specifically, our objectives are to: i) ensure EMF exposure compliance using actual EIRP control when implementing the "actual maximum approach" described in IEC 62232:2022, ii) guarantee a minimum EIRP level, and iii) prevent resource shortages at all times. We first investigate exact and conservative algorithms, with linear and constant complexity, respectively, to compute the maximum allowed EIRP consumption under constraints i) and ii), referred to as EIRP "budget". Subsequently, we design a control method based on Drift-Plus-Penalty theory that preemptively curbs EIRP consumption only when needed to avoid future resource shortages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a multi-sensor system where each sensor may monitor more than one time-varying information process and send status updates to a remote monitor over a common channel. We consider that each sensor's status update may contain information about more than one information process in the system subject to the system's constraints. To investigate the impact of this correlation on the overall system's performance, we conduct an analysis of both the average Age of Information (AoI) and source state estimation error at the monitor. Building upon this analysis, we subsequently explore the impact of the packet arrivals, correlation probabilities, and rate of processes' state change on the system's performance. Next, we consider the case where sensors have limited sensing abilities and distribute a portion of their sensing abilities across the different processes. We optimize this distribution to minimize the total AoI of the system. Interestingly, we show that monitoring multiple processes from a single source may not always be beneficial. Our results also reveal that the optimal sensing distribution for diverse arrival rates may exhibit a rapid regime switch, rather than smooth transitions, after crossing critical system values. This highlights the importance of identifying these critical thresholds to ensure effective system performance.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements, where $q=p^{m}$ with $p$ being a prime number and $m$ being a positive integer. Let $\mathcal{C}_{(q, n, \delta, h)}$ be a class of BCH codes of length $n$ and designed $\delta$. A linear code $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if the minimum distance $d=n-k+1$. If $d=n-k$, then $\mathcal{C}$ is called an almost MDS (AMDS) code. Moreover, if both of $\mathcal{C}$ and its dual code $\mathcal{C}^{\bot}$ are AMDS, then $\mathcal{C}$ is called a near MDS (NMDS) code. In [A class of almost MDS codes, {\it Finite Fields Appl.} {\bf 79} (2022), \#101996], Geng, Yang, Zhang and Zhou proved that the BCH code $\mathcal{C}_{(q, q+1,3,4)}$ is an almost MDS code, where $q=3^m$ and $m$ is an odd integer, and they also showed that its parameters is $[q+1, q-3, 4]$. Furthermore, they proposed a conjecture stating that the dual code $\mathcal{C}^{\bot}_{(q, q+1, 3, 4)}$ is also an AMDS code with parameters $[q+1, 4, q-3]$. In this paper, we first present a characterization for the dual code of an almost MDS code to be an almost MDS code. Then we use this result to show that the Geng-Yang-Zhang-Zhou conjecture is true. Our result together with the Geng-Yang-Zhang-Zhou theorem implies that the BCH code $\mathcal{C}_{(q, q+1,3,4)}$ is a near MDS code.</description>
