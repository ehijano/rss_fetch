      <title>Characterization of precipitation-induced radon progeny deposition events using a city-scale sensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of radiation detectors provide a platform for real-time radioactive source detection and identification in urban environments. Detection algorithms in these systems must adapt to naturally-occurring changes in background, which requires well-characterized relationships between precipitation events and their corresponding radiological signature. We present a description of rain-induced radon progeny deposition events occurring in Chicago from September 2023 through February 2024. We measure ambient gamma radiation levels, precipitation rate, temperature, pressure and relative humidity in a network of sensor nodes. For each identified precipitation period, we decompose spectra into static- and radon-associated components as defined by a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. We find a consistent power-law relationship between a precipitation-dependent peak of the radon progeny proxy (RPP) and the peak strength of radon-associated NMF component for most precipitation events. We conduct a case study of a rainfall period with abnormally high levels of implied radon progeny concentration and describe its temporal and spatial evolution. We hypothesize this phenomenon is due to the air mass path that intersects a uranium-rich region of Wyoming. Finally, we cluster precipitation events into three distinct categories. One category roughly corresponds to events with deep low-pressure systems and high relative radon concentration, while another is characteristic of light stratiform rain with slightly higher temperatures and intermediate relative radon concentration. The third category contains a weak-gradient or lake breeze convection showers with intermittent precipitation and low relative radon concentration. These findings suggest that radiological anomaly detection could be improved by training unique background models corresponding to each category of meteorological event.</description>

      <title>A Targeted Quadrature Framework for Simulating Large-Scale 3D Anisotropic Electromagnetic Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new, efficient, and accurate method to simulate frequency-domain borehole electromagnetic (EM) measurements acquired in the presence of three-dimensional (3D) variations of the anisotropic subsurface conductivity. The method is based on solving the quasi-static Maxwell equations with a goal-oriented finite-volume discretization via block-quadrature reduced-order modeling. Discretization is performed with a Lebedev grid that enables accurate and conservative solutions in the presence of any form of anisotropic electrical conductivity. Likewise, the method makes use of a new effective-medium approximation to locally account for non-conformal boundaries and large contrasts in electrical conductivity, especially in the vicinity of EM sources and receivers. The finite-volume discretization yields a large symmetric linear system of equations, which is reduced to a set of smaller structured problems via block Lanczos recursion. The formulation also enables the efficient calculation of the adjoint solution, which is necessary for gradient-based inversion of the measurements to estimate the associated spatial distribution of electrical conductivity, i.e., to solve the inverse problem. Specific applications and verifications of the new numerical simulation algorithm are considered for the case of borehole ultra-deep azimuthal resistivity measurements (UDAR) typically used for subsurface well geosteering and navigation. We verify the efficiency, robustness, and scalability of this approach using synthetic UDAR measurements acquired in a 3D formation inspired by North-Sea geology. The numerical experiments successfully verify the applicability of our modeling approach to real-time UDAR processing frameworks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Blister and Subglacial Hydrology Framework for Supraglacial Lake Drainage Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subglacial blisters form due to the rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes into grounded ice sheets, and are characterised by elastic ice uplift and transient ice-velocity anomalies. Although blister occurrence is confirmed by observations, the dynamics of blisters and their impacts on ice flow remain poorly represented in current subglacial hydrology models, as typical cavity-channel system models cannot capture short-timescale blister formation, propagation, and relaxation. Here we present a unified, self-consistent modelling framework that directly couples blister evolution with the subglacial drainage system, extending existing subglacial hydrology models to account for transient responses to rapid lake drainage events. Numerical simulations, validated by field observations, reveal distinct seasonal behavior: during summer, lake drainage generates short-lived blisters that rapidly leak water into a pre-existing drainage system of efficient, channelised water pathways, whereas winter drainage results in persistent blisters that propagate and serve as the primary meltwater pathway at the ice-bed interface. The dynamics of blister propagation and leakage in our model are governed by effective viscosity and a characteristic leakage length scale, which reflects the connection between the blister and the surrounding hydrological network. This unified model offers a valuable tool for investigating blister dynamics and their interplay with subglacial hydrology, facilitating the interpretation of observed surface uplift and ice-velocity variations following supraglacial lake drainage events.</description>

      <title>Physically Informed Bayesian Retrieval of SWE and Snow Depth in Forested Areas from Airborne X And Ku-Band SAR Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a coupled physical statistical framework for retrieving snow water equivalent (SWE) in forested areas using dual frequency X and Ku band SAR observations. The method combines a multilayer snow hydrology model (MSHM) with microwave propagation and backscatter models, and includes a canopy parameterization based on a modified Water Cloud Model that accounts for canopy closure. The framework is applied to airborne SnowSAR measurements over Grand Mesa, Colorado, and evaluated against snow pit SWE and LiDAR snow depth from the SnowEx'17 campaign. Prior distributions of snowpack properties are generated with MSHM forced by numerical weather prediction, and vegetation and soil parameters are initialized from Ku HH observations under frozen conditions and interpolated from open to nearby forested areas using kriging. Successful SWE and snow depth retrievals in forested pixels are obtained where relative backscatter residuals are below 30% for incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, capturing both the mean and variance of snowpack distributions. For 90 m forested pixels, the snow depth RMSE is 0.033 m (less than 8% of maximum pit SWE), with improved spatial patterns relative to hydrology only simulations. Performance degrades in highly heterogeneous land cover such as mixed forest and wetlands and along canopy and water boundaries due to uncertainty in canopy closure, although absolute snow depth differences remain below 10% and 20% for about 62% and 82% of pixels, respectively. Retrievals at 30 m resolution for one flight further reduce spatial errors and increase the fraction of low error pixels by about 78% at a 10% absolute error threshold, demonstrating the feasibility of dual frequency Bayesian SWE retrievals in forested landscapes by combining physical modeling with SAR observations.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Learning-Based Framework for Focal Mechanism Determination and Its Application to the 2022 Luding Earthquake Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: P-wave first-motion polarity plays an important role in resolving focal mechanisms of small to moderate earthquakes (M &lt;= 4.5). High-quality focal mechanism solutions for abundant small events can greatly improve our understanding of regional tectonics, fault geometries, and stress-field characteristics. In this study, we develop an automated focal mechanism determination framework that integrates deep neural networks with P-wave first-motion polarity observations, and apply it to the 2022 Luding earthquake sequence. The model is trained on 12 years (2009-2020) of manually annotated 100 Hz waveform records from the China National Seismic Network, achieving a polarity recall of 97.4 percent and a precision of 98.5 percent. After automatically determining the first-motion polarities, we invert focal mechanisms using the HASH method. The resulting focal mechanism solutions show high consistency with mapped fault structures in the Luding region, demonstrating the reliability and applicability of the proposed workflow.</description>

      <title>A multiresolution weather dataset for the Southwestern South Atlantic (2017-2018)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Southwestern South Atlantic (SWSA) is a key region for climate research and renewable energy assessment, yet high-resolution meteorological data are scarce. We present a multiresolution dataset spanning February 2017--November 2018, combining Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations with Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) wind fields processed using the CMOD5 model. WRF outputs were generated every 30 minutes for three nested domains (9 km, 3 km, 1 km) through 975 short-term simulations. SAR/CMOD5 wind fields are provided at 500 m and 1 km resolution across 104 acquisition dates. Validation shows strong agreement: daily spatial averages of 10 m wind speed yield RMSE and MAE below 3 m/s on over 93% of acquisition days, while more than 91.5% of pixel-level residuals fall within $\pm$3 m/s. In situ measurements from the Itaja\'{i} buoy further confirmed the reliability of both sources. The dataset supports regional climate studies, wind energy resource assessment, and machine-learning applications in forecasting and downscaling, with usage examples included to aid practical adoption.</description>

      <title>On the planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo: Evidence from a Lagrangian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether planetary motions influence the solar magnetic cycle has remained an open question due to the lack of a rigorous physical mechanism. Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.</description>

      <title>Prior-Driven Self-Supervised Lightweight Method for Seismic Signal Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic exploration is currently the most mature approach for studying subsurface structures, yet the presence of noise greatly restricts its imaging accuracy. Previous methods still face significant challenges: traditional computational methods are often computationally complex and their effectiveness is hard to guarantee; deep learning methods rely heavily on datasets, and the complexity of network training makes them difficult to apply in practical field scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a neural network that has only 2464 learnable parameters, which is hundreds or even thousands of times lower than that of the current mainstream deep learning networks. And its parameter constraints rely on priors rather than requiring training data. We proposed two types of priors: the local prior and the global variance prior for self-supervised learning, and put forward low-scale learning to further enhance its performance in noise processing. We validated our method on both synthetic and field data, and the results indicate that our proposed approach effectively attenuates random noise.</description>

      <title>A Norwegian Approach to Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive geoscientific downscaling model strategy is presented outlining an approach that has evolved over the last 20 years, together with an explanation for its development, its technical aspects, and evaluation scheme. This effort has resulted in an open-source and free R-based tool, 'esd', for the benefit of sharing and improving the reproducibility of the downscaling results. Furthermore, a set of new metrics was developed as an integral part of the downscaling approach which assesses model performance with an emphasis on regional information for society (RifS). These metrics involve novel ways of comparing model results with observational data and have been developed for downscaling large multi-model global climate model ensembles. This paper presents for the first time an overview of the comprehensive framework adopted by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute for downscaling aimed at supporting climate change adaptation. A literature search suggests that this comprehensive downscaling strategy and evaluation scheme are not widely used within the downscaling community. In addition, this strategy involves a new convention for storing large datasets of ensemble results that provides fast access to information and drastically saves data volume.</description>

      <title>Encoder-Inverter Framework for Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance inversion is a challenging problem in geophysical exploration, primarily due to the scarcity of well-logging data and the inherent nonlinearity of the task. Most existing inversion methods, including semi-supervised learning approaches, still face limitations in accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose a novel Encoder-Inverter framework that maps continuous seismic traces into high-dimensional linear features, thereby transforming the inversion task into a linear extrapolation or interpolation problem to enhance stability and performance. To achieve this, we introduce two auxiliary models to assist in encoder training and adopt a heterogeneous model structure to prevent shortcut learning, enabling the extraction of more generalizable and effective linear features. We evaluate the proposed method on widely used benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior inversion accuracy and robustness compared to previous methods. To promote reproducibility, we will also open-source the data and code.</description>
