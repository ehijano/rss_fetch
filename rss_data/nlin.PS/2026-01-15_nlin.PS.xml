      <title>Bright soliton interactions in the variable coefficient Fokas-Lenells equation, Conservation laws, Modulation instability and Soliton tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a study of the bright soliton dynamics in an inhomogeneous fibre by means of variable coefficient Fokas-Lenells equation with time varying dispersion, nonlinearity and gain/loss parameter. At first, we propose our system that governs the propagation of ultrashort pulses in an inhomogeneous fibre. Secondly, under a suitable gauge transformation, we transform the system into a simplified form of variable coefficient Fokas-Lenells equation. The Lax integrability and conservation laws are exhibited. We also study the stability of the generalised plane wave against small amplitude perturbations. Thereafter, by using a nonstandard Hirota bilinearization method with the help of a suitable auxiliary function, we obtain the bright one soliton, two soliton and provide a scheme for obtaining N-bright soliton solutions. The elastic collision dynamics of the two solitons is studied using asymptotic analysis. We also investigate the soliton acceleration/retardation under a suitable choice of dispersion and nonlinearity coefficients. Finally, the dramatic effect of the nonlinear tunnelling of the bright one and two-soliton is also studied under some Gaussian dispersion or nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Floquet breathers in a modulated nonlinear lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a space-time modulated electro-mechanical system, consisting of an array of coupled cantilevers with their on-site potential provided by electromagnets driven by AC currents. Model equations are derived, and the effect of the modulation on the dispersion bands is examined. The theory of breather existence and stability is extended to include space-time modulation. We perform numerical simulations in a time-modulated system, showing three types of breather response depending on the driving frequency: (i) the modulation frequency is an integer multiple of the breather frequency or, in other words, this phenomenon corresponds to period doubling, tripling, etc.; (ii) the opposite, that is, the breather frequency is an integer multiple of the modulation frequency, corresponding to period-halving, etc. (iii) the breather and modulation frequencies are commensurate in a different form. We use for all of them the term {\em Floquet breathers} in analogy with Floquet solitons in photonic systems. As there is no dissipation, but periodic forcing, the energy is conserved but only at discrete times. There exists in this system a huge variety of breathers, either site-centered, symmetric and antisymmetric, bond centered, in-phase or in-quadrature with the modulation, and we analyze the evolution of stability of some of them as a function of the modulation frequency. The construction of a similar system would be of interest to study the properties of dynamic metamaterials.</description>
