      <title>Computational Self-Assembly of a Six-Fold Chiral Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are unique materials characterized by long-range order without periodicity. They are observed in systems such as metallic alloys, soft matter, and particle simulations. Unlike periodic crystals, which are invariant under real-space symmetry operations, quasicrystals possess symmetry described by a space group in reciprocal space. In this study, we report the self-assembly of a six-fold chiral quasicrystal using molecular dynamics simulations of a two-dimensional particle system. These particles interact via the Lennard-Jones-Gauss pair potential and are subjected to a periodic substrate potential. Our findings confirm the presence of chiral symmetry through diffraction patterns and order parameters, revealing unique local motifs in both real and reciprocal space. We demonstrate that the quasicrystal's properties, including the tiling structure and symmetry and the extent of diffuse scattering, are influenced by substrate potential depth and temperature. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of chiral quasicrystal formation and the role of external fields in tailoring quasicrystal structures.</description>

      <title>Distilling Machine Learning's Added Value: Pareto Fronts in Atmospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the added value of machine learning (ML) for weather and climate applications is measurable, explaining it remains challenging, especially for large deep learning models. Inspired by climate model hierarchies, we propose that a full hierarchy of Pareto-optimal models, defined within an appropriately determined error-complexity plane, can guide model development and help understand the models' added value. We demonstrate the use of Pareto fronts in atmospheric physics through three sample applications, with hierarchies ranging from semi-empirical models with minimal tunable parameters (simplest) to deep learning algorithms (most complex). First, in cloud cover parameterization, we find that neural networks identify nonlinear relationships between cloud cover and its thermodynamic environment, and assimilate previously neglected features such as vertical gradients in relative humidity that improve the representation of low cloud cover. This added value is condensed into a ten-parameter equation that rivals the performance of deep learning models. Second, we establish a ML model hierarchy for emulating shortwave radiative transfer, distilling the importance of bidirectional vertical connectivity for accurately representing absorption and scattering, especially for multiple cloud layers. Third, we emphasize the importance of convective organization information when modeling the relationship between tropical precipitation and its surrounding environment. We discuss the added value of temporal memory when high-resolution spatial information is unavailable, with implications for precipitation parameterization. Therefore, by comparing data-driven models directly with existing schemes using Pareto optimality, we promote process understanding by hierarchically unveiling system complexity, with the hope of improving the trustworthiness of ML models in atmospheric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable programming opens exciting new avenues in particle physics, also affecting future event generators. These new techniques boost the performance of current and planned MadGraph implementations. Combining phase-space mappings with a set of very small learnable flow elements, MadNIS-Lite, can improve the sampling efficiency while being physically interpretable. This defines a third sampling strategy, complementing VEGAS and the full MadNIS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current era of quantum computing, robust and efficient tools are essential to bridge the gap between simulations and quantum hardware execution. In this work, we introduce a machine learning approach to characterize the noise impacting a quantum chip and emulate it during simulations. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing various noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized benchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has been validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits. Additionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive imaging assisted CFD simulation of 4D multi-modal fluid flow using In-situ adaptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to recover the true surfaces of fluid channels and fed to simulation tool (ANSYS) to create accurate cyber environment. The simulation tool also receives CT-assisted multiphase fluid profiles (belonging to the instance just before the flow starts) as an initial condition.
  This unique methodology is made possible by using a novel in-situ compact adaptor design is used to create fluid channels that can be placed inside any industrial X-ray CT and fulfill the above objective. It is integrated with an android based App to control the flow once placed inside CT. It is portable and compact enough: (a) to be placed inside various experimental environments, and (b) modular enough to be mounted with multi-modal systems simultaneously.
  Two key parameters, (a) spatial distribution and (b) the air volume fraction, are measured using two different non-invasive imaging modalities: (a) Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and (d) X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Simulated outcomes are correlated with the experimental outcomes from both EIT and X-ray CT, showing an agreement of 85 to 98 percent, respectively. Time-averaged electrically conductive fluid flow profile obtained by EIT shows a match with mass mass-attenuated fluid profile obtained by X-ray CT, justifying the utility of an in-situ adaptor. CT assistance for CFD studies can be replaced by EIT assistance as former techniques: (a) scanning time may be relatively slower than the latter, (b) it does not require rotations, (c) economical, and (d) fluid channels need not be placed inside of shielded compartment thus improving practicality. The data of analysis is shared in this work.
  Multimodal non-invasive imaging provides multiphase flow information, it also differentiates conductive, and mass-attenuated multiphase profiles at common cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Accelerated 3D Maxwell Integral Equation Solver using the Interpolated Factored Green Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an $O(N\log N)$ method for numerical solution of Maxwell's equations for dielectric scatterers using a 3D boundary integral equation (BIE) method. The underlying BIE method used is based on a hybrid Nystr\"{o}m-collocation method using Chebyshev polynomials. It is well known that such an approach produces a dense linear system, which requires $O(N^2)$ operations in each step of an iterative solver. In this work, we propose an approach using the recently introduced Interpolated Factored Green's Function (IFGF) acceleration strategy to reduce the cost of each iteration to $O(N\log N)$. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first ever application of the IFGF method to fully-vectorial 3D Maxwell problems. The Chebyshev-based integral solver and IFGF method are first introduced, followed by the extension of the scalar IFGF to the vectorial Maxwell case. Several examples are presented verifying the $O(N\log N)$ computational complexity of the approach, including scattering from spheres, complex CAD models, and nanophotonic waveguiding devices. In one particular example with more than 6 million unknowns, the accelerated IFGF solver runs 42x faster than the unaccelerated method.</description>

      <title>Learning Atoms from Crystal Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational modelling of materials using machine learning, ML, and historical data has become integral to materials research. The efficiency of computational modelling is strongly affected by the choice of the numerical representation for describing the composition, structure and chemical elements. Structure controls the properties, but often only the composition of a candidate material is available. Existing elemental descriptors lack direct access to structural insights such as the coordination geometry of an element. In this study, we introduce Local Environment-induced Atomic Features, LEAFs, which incorporate information about the statistically preferred local coordination geometry for atoms in crystal structure into descriptors for chemical elements, enabling the modelling of materials solely as compositions without requiring knowledge of their crystal structure. In the crystal structure, each atomic site can be described by similarity to common local structural motifs; by aggregating these features of similarity from the experimentally verified crystal structures of inorganic materials, LEAFs formulate a set of descriptors for chemical elements and compositions. The direct connection of LEAFs to the local coordination geometry enables the analysis of ML model property predictions, linking compositions to the underlying structure-property relationships. We demonstrate the versatility of LEAFs in structure-informed property predictions for compositions, mapping of chemical space in structural terms, and prioritising elemental substitutions. Based on the latter for predicting crystal structures of binary ionic compounds, LEAFs achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy of 86 per cent. These results suggest that the structurally informed description of chemical elements and compositions developed in this work can effectively guide synthetic efforts in discovering new materials.</description>

      <title>Change Point Detection of Events in Molecular Simulations using dupin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15090v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle tracking is commonly used to study time-dependent behavior in many different types of physical and chemical systems involving constituents that span many length scales, including atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, granular particles, etc. Behaviors of interest studied using particle tracking information include disorder-order transitions, thermodynamic phase transitions, structural transitions, protein folding, crystallization, gelation, swarming, avalanches and fracture. A common challenge in studies of these systems involves change detection. Change point detection discerns when a temporal signal undergoes a change in distribution. These changes can be local or global, instantaneous or prolonged, obvious or subtle. Moreover, system-wide changes marking an interesting physical or chemical phenomenon (e.g. crystallization) are often preceded by events (e.g. pre-nucleation clusters) that are localized and can occur anywhere at anytime in the system. For these reasons, detecting events in particle trajectories generated by molecular simulation is challenging and typically accomplished via ad hoc solutions unique to the behavior and system under study. Consequently, methods for event detection lack generality, and those used in one field are not easily used by scientists in other fields. Here we present a new Python-based tool, dupin, that allows for event detection from particle trajectory data irrespective of the system details. dupin works by creating a signal representing the simulation and partitioning the signal based on events (changes within the trajectory). This approach allows for studies where manual annotating of event boundaries would require a prohibitive amount of time. Furthermore, dupin can serve as a tool in automated and reproducible workflows. We demonstrate the application of dupin using two examples and discuss its applicability to a wider class of problems.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of openPMD on BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Code, through Instrumentation, Monitoring, and In-Situ Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations on large-scale systems play a fundamental role in understanding the complexities of plasma dynamics in fusion devices. Efficient handling and analysis of vast datasets are essential for advancing these simulations. Previously, we addressed this challenge by integrating openPMD with BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo code, streamlining data streaming and storage. This integration not only enhanced data management but also improved write throughput and storage efficiency. In this work, we delve deeper into the impact of BIT1 openPMD BP4 instrumentation, monitoring, and in-situ analysis. Utilizing cutting-edge profiling and monitoring tools such as gprof, CrayPat, Cray Apprentice2, IPM, and Darshan, we dissect BIT1's performance post-integration, shedding light on computation, communication, and I/O operations. Fine-grained instrumentation offers insights into BIT1's runtime behavior, while immediate monitoring aids in understanding system dynamics and resource utilization patterns, facilitating proactive performance optimization. Advanced visualization techniques further enrich our understanding, enabling the optimization of BIT1 simulation workflows aimed at controlling plasma-material interfaces with improved data analysis and visualization at every checkpoint without causing any interruption to the simulation.</description>

Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics.

We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Improved Current Density Reconstruction from 2D Vector Magnetic Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconstruction of electrical current densities from magnetic field measurements is an important technique with applications in materials science, circuit design, quality control, plasma physics, and biology. Analytic reconstruction methods exist for planar currents, but break down in the presence of high spatial frequency noise or large standoff distance, restricting the types of systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate the use of a deep convolutional neural network for current density reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) images of vector magnetic fields acquired by a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) utilizing a surface layer of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Trained network performance significantly exceeds analytic reconstruction for data with high noise or large standoff distances. This machine learning technique can perform quality inversions on lower SNR data, reducing the data collection time by a factor of about 400 and permitting reconstructions of weaker and three-dimensional current sources.</description>

      <title>Fast and scalable finite-element based approach for density functional theory calculations using projector-augmented wave method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($&gt;$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phenomena in symmetrically charged binary particle systems under planar nanoconfinement with negative dielectric constants.The SSB is triggered $solely$ via the dielectric confinement effect, without any external fields. The mechanism of SSB is found to be caused by the strong polarization field enhanced by nanoconfinement, giving rise to charge/field oscillations in the transverse directions. Interestingly, dielectric contrast can even determine the degree of SSB in transverse and longitudinal dimensions, forming charge-separated interfacial liquids and clusters on square lattices. Furthermore, we analytically show that the formed lattice constant is determined by the dielectric mismatch and the length scale of confinement, which is validated via molecular dynamics simulations. The novel broken symmetry mechanism may provide new insights in the study of quasi-2D systems and the design of future nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Rapid Discovery of Graphene Nanocrystals Using DFT and Bayesian Optimization with Neural Network Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful computational method used to obtain physical and chemical properties of materials. In the materials discovery framework, it is often necessary to virtually screen a large and high-dimensional chemical space to find materials with desired properties. However, grid searching a large chemical space with DFT is inefficient due to its high computational cost. We propose an approach utilizing Bayesian optimization (BO) with an artificial neural network kernel to enable smart search. This method leverages the BO algorithm, where the neural network, trained on a limited number of DFT results, determines the most promising regions of the chemical space to explore in subsequent iterations. This approach aims to discover materials with target properties while minimizing the number of DFT calculations required. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we investigated 63 doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with sizes ranging from 1 to 2 nm to find the structure with the highest light absorbance. Using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) only 12 times, we achieved a significant reduction in computational cost, approximately 20% of what would be required for a full grid search, by employing the BO algorithm with a neural network kernel. Considering that TDDFT calculations for a single GQD require about half a day of wall time on high-performance computing nodes, this reduction is substantial. Our approach can be generalized to the discovery of new drugs, chemicals, crystals, and alloys with high-dimensional and large chemical spaces, offering a scalable solution for various applications in materials science.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion with time step prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field (FF) methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network FF models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface (PES) instead of the complex physical PES. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical FFs, equivariant neural network FFs trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their energies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic In-context Learning with Conversational Models for Data Extraction and Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the extraction of data from unstructured scholarly papers. However, ensuring data trustworthiness remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce PropertyExtractor, an open-source tool that leverages advanced conversational LLMs like Google gemini-pro and OpenAI gpt-4, blends zero-shot with few-shot in-context learning, and employs engineered prompts for the dynamic refinement of structured information hierarchies - enabling autonomous, efficient, scalable, and accurate identification, extraction, and verification of material property data. Our tests on material data demonstrate precision and recall that exceed 95\% with an error rate of approximately 9%, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the toolkit. Finally, databases for 2D material thicknesses, a critical parameter for device integration, and energy bandgap values are developed using PropertyExtractor. Specifically for the thickness database, the rapid evolution of the field has outpaced both experimental measurements and computational methods, creating a significant data gap. Our work addresses this gap and showcases the potential of PropertyExtractor as a reliable and efficient tool for the autonomous generation of various material property databases, advancing the field.</description>
