      <title>On the extension problems for the 33-stem homotopy groups of the 6-, 7- and 8-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the extension problems for the homotopy groups $\pi_{39}(S^{6})$, $\pi_{40}(S^{7})$, and $\pi_{41}(S^{8})$ localized at 2, the puzzles having remained unsolved for forty-five years. We introduce a tool for the theory of determinations of unstable homotopy groups, namely, the $\mathcal{Z}$-shape Toda bracket, by which we are able to solve the extension problems with respect to these three homotopy groups.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of Vietoris-Rips Complexes of dense subsets in $(\mathbb{R}^n, \ell_1)$ via hyperconvex embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the contractibility of Vietoris-Rips complexes of dense subsets of $(\mathbb{R}^n,\ell_1)$ with sufficiently large scales. This is motivated by a question by Matthew Zaremsky regarding whether for each $n$ natural there is a $r_n&gt;0$ so that the Vietoris-Rips complex of $(\mathbb{Z}^n,\ell_1)$ at scale $r$ is contractible for all $r\geq r_n$. We approach this question using results that relates to the neighborhood of embeddings into hyperconvex metric space of a metric space $X$ and its connection to the Vietoris-Rips complex of $X$. In this manner, we provide positive answers to the question above for the case $n=2$ and $3$.</description>

      <title>The cancellation property for projective modules over integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a partial classification of the finite groups $G$ for which the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ has projective cancellation, i.e. for which $P \oplus \mathbb{Z} G \cong Q \oplus \mathbb{Z} G$ implies $P \cong Q$ for projective $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules $P$ and $Q$. To do this, we prove a cancellation theorem based on a relative version of the Eichler condition and use it to establish the cancellation property for a large class of finite groups. We then use a group theoretic argument to precisely determine the class of groups not covered by this result. The final classification is then obtained by applying results of Swan, Chen and Bley-Hofmann-Johnston which show failure of the cancellation property for certain groups.</description>

      <title>The higher algebra of weighted colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of weighted colimits in the framework of weakly bi-enriched $\infty$-categories, an extension of Lurie's notion of enriched $\infty$-categories. We prove an existence result for weighted colimits, study weighted colimits of diagrams of enriched functors, express weighted colimits via enriched coends, characterize the enriched $\infty$-category of enriched presheaves as the free cocompletion under weighted colimits and develop a theory of universally adjoining weighted colimits to an enriched $\infty$-category. We use the latter technique to construct for every presentably $\mathbb{E}_{k+1}$-monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$ for $1 \leq k \leq \infty$ and class $\mathcal{H}$ of $\mathcal{V}$-weights, with respect to which weighted colimits are defined, a presentably $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal structure on the $\infty$-category of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories that admit $\mathcal{H}$-weighted colimits. Varying $\mathcal{H}$ this $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal structure interpolates between the tensor product for $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories and the relative tensor product for $\infty$-categories presentably left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$. As an application we prove that forming $\mathcal{V}$-enriched presheaves is $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal, construct a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched version of Day-convolution and give a new construction of the tensor product for $\infty$-categories presentably left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$ as a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched localization of Day-convolution. As further applications we construct a tensor product for Cauchy-complete $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories, a tensor product for $(\infty,2)$-categories with (op)lax colimits and a tensor product for stable $(\infty,n)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Characterizing closed curves on Riemann surfaces via homology groups of coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2373</link>
      <description>arXiv:1111.2373v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a hyperbolic oriented Riemann surface of finite type. The main purpose of this paper is to show that non-trivial geometric intersection between closed curves on $S$ is detected by some symplectic submodules they naturally determine in the homology groups of the compactifications of unramified $p$-coverings of $S$, for $p\geq 2$ a fixed prime. In particular, this gives a characterization of simple closed curves on $S$ in terms of homology groups of $p$-coverings. We then define a $p$-adic Reidemeister pairing on the fundamental group of $S$ and show that the free homotopy classes of two loops have trivial geometric intersection if and only if they are orthogonal with respect to this pairing. As an application, we give a geometric argument to prove that oriented surface groups are conjugacy $p$-separable (a combinatorial proof of this fact was recentely given by Paris).</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of $N_\infty$ operads for $C_{qp^n}$ and $D_{p^n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general recursive method for constructing transfer systems on finite lattices. Using this we calculate the number of homotopically distinct $N_\infty$ operads for dihedral groups $D_{p^n}$, $p &gt; 2$ prime, and cyclic groups $C_{qp^n}$, $p \neq q$ prime. We then further display some of the beautiful combinatorics obtained by restricting to certain homotopically meaningful $N_\infty$ operads for these groups.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Prefactorization Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the theory of operadic Koszul duality to provide a cofibrant resolution of the colored operad whose algebras are prefactorization algebras on a fixed space M. his allows us to describe a notion of prefactorization algebra up to homotopy as well as morphisms up to homotopy between such objects. We make explicit these notions for several special M, such as certain finite topological spaces, or the real line.</description>

Abstract: This paper tackles \textit{N. Oda}'s extension problems for the homotopy groups $\pi_{39}(S^{6})$, $\pi_{40}(S^{7})$, and $\pi_{41}(S^{8})$ localized at 2, the issues having eluded resolution for more than four decades. We introduce a tool for the theory of determinations of unstable homotopy groups, namely, the rectangular Toda bracket, by which we are able to solve the extension problems with respect to these three homotopy groups.</description>

      <title>Keeping it sparse: Computing Persistent Homology revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study several variants of matrix reduction via Gaussian elimination that try to keep the reduced matrix sparse. The motivation comes from the growing field of topological data analysis where matrix reduction is the major subroutine to compute barcodes, the main invariant therein. We propose two novel variants of the standard algorithm, called swap and retrospective reductions. We test them on a large collection of data against other known variants to compare their efficiency, and we find that sometimes they provide a considerable speed-up. We also present novel output-sensitive bounds for the retrospective variant which better explain the discrepancy between the cubic worst-case complexity bound and the almost linear practical behavior of matrix reduction. Finally, we provide several constructions on which one of the variants performs strictly better than the others.</description>

      <title>Cohomology on the centric orbit category of a fusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the higher derived limits of mod $p$ cohomology on the centric orbit category of a saturated fusion system on a finite $p$-group. It is an open problem whether all such higher limits vanish. This is known in many cases, including for fusion systems realized by a finite group and for many classes of fusion systems which are not so realized. We prove that the higher limits of $H^j$ vanish provided $j$ is small relative to $p$, by showing that the same is true for the contravariant part of a simple Mackey composition factor of $H^j$ under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Recovering generalized homology from Floer homology: the complex oriented case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate an invariant called the completed Tate cohomology to a filtered circle equivariant spectrum and a complex oriented cohomology theory. We show that when the filtered spectrum is the spectral symplectic cohomology of a Liouville manifold, this invariant depends only on the stable homotopy type of the underlying manifold. We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest from the perspective of dynamics.</description>
