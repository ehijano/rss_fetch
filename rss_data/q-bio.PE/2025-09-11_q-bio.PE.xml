      <title>Exact conditions for evolutionary stability in indirect reciprocity under noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism for large-scale cooperation. This mechanism captures the insight that in part, people help others to build and maintain a good reputation. To enable such cooperation, appropriate social norms are essential. They specify how individuals should act based on each others' reputations, and how reputations are updated in response to individual actions. Although previous work has identified several norms that sustain cooperation, a complete analytical characterization of all evolutionarily stable norms remains lacking, especially when assessments or actions are noisy. In this study, we provide such a characterization for the public assessment regime. This characterization reproduces known results, such as the leading eight norms, but it extends to more general cases, allowing for various types of errors and additional actions including costly punishment. We also identify norms that impose a fixed payoff on any mutant strategy, analogous to the zero-determinant strategies in direct reciprocity. These results offer a rigorous foundation for understanding the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity and the critical role of social norms.</description>

      <title>First highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in a commercial farm in Brazil: outbreak timeline, control actions, risk analysis, and transmission modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On May 15, 2025, Brazil reported its first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in a commercial poultry breeder farm in Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul. This study presents the outbreak timeline, control measures, along with spatial risk assessment and epidemiological model used to simulate detection delays. The transmission model considered Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered Dead farm statuses to simulate within farm and between farm dynamics under 3 day, 5 day, and 10 day detection delays. The single infected commercial farm lost 15,650 birds, with 92% mortality due to HPAI, and additional culling of the remaining birds on Day 5 post-notification to the state animal health officials. Based on the mortality and outbreak response data, the introduction likely occurred 3 10 days before its official detection. Our field investigations suggested that wild birds were the most likely source of introduction, although biosecurity breaches could not be ruled out. Control measures implemented included movement restrictions and a control zone, from which 4,197 vehicles were inspected upon entry. Risk analysis classified 64.4% of municipalities as low risk, 35.0% as medium risk, and 0.6% as high risk. Our HPAI disease simulation results showed that the number of secondary infections would increase from a median of 4 farms (IQR 2 5) with a 3 day delay to 6 (IQR 3 22) and 34 (IQR 12 47) farms with 5 day and 10 day delays, respectively. The rapid veterinary response eliminated the outbreak within 32 days of detection, highlighting the critical role of early detection and prompt response.</description>

      <title>Evolution, the mother of age-related diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary origins of ageing and age-associated diseases continue to pose a fundamental question in biology. This study is concerned with a recently proposed framework, which conceptualises development and ageing as a continuous process, driven by genetically encoded epigenetic changes in target sets of cells. According to the Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing (ESTA), ageing reflects the cumulative manifestation of epigenetic changes that are predominantly expressed during the post-reproductive phase. These late-acting modifications are not yet evolutionarily optimised but are instead subject to ongoing selection, functioning as somatic "experiments" through which evolution explores novel phenotypic variation. These experiments are often detrimental, leading to progressive physical decline and eventual death, while a small subset may produce beneficial adaptations, that evolution can exploit to shape future developmental trajectories. According to ESTA, ageing can be understood as evolution in action, yet old age is also the strongest risk factor for major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndrome. We argue that this association is not merely correlational but causal: the same epigenetic process that drive development and ageing also underlie age-associated diseases. Growing evidence points to epigenetic regulation as a central factor in these pathologies, since no consistent patterns of genetic mutations have been identified, whereas widespread regulatory and epigenetic disruptions are observed. From this perspective, evolution is not only the driver of ageing but also the ultimate source of the diseases that accompany it, making it the root cause of most age-related pathologies.</description>

      <title>Self-organized hyperuniformity in a minimal model of population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a novel scenario for hyperuniformity in a generic model of population dynamics that has been recently introduced to account for biological memory in the immune system and epigenetic inheritance. In this model, individuals' competition over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. Here we uncover that the spatially extended model is characterized by hyperuniform density fluctuations. A hydrodynamic theory is derived by explicit coarse-graining, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, we trace the emergence of hyperuniformity to the divergence of timescales close to criticality. These findings can have applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics and ecology.</description>

      <title>MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities. Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting, with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics of generalist/specialist strategies in the feast-famine cycles</title>

Abstract: Microbial populations exhibit a broad spectrum of nutrient utilization strategies, ranging from strategies utilizing diverse nutrients, called "generalists," to those being highly adapted to specific nutrients, called "specialists." The mathematical conditions for the diversification of nutrient utilization strategies are central questions in theoretical ecology. Previous studies have shown that trade-offs among different resource utilization functions that cells cannot utilize broad types of substrates at near-maximum speed are crucial for the emergence of diverse strategies. However, in natural settings, nutrient availability often fluctuates over time, imposing additional trade-offs on cells. Cells that grow rapidly under nutrient-rich conditions will suffer a higher death rate under nutrient-poor conditions, creating a growth-death trade-off that intersects with the classical resource-use trade-off. Here, we introduce a unified mathematical model that simultaneously incorporates the resource-use trade-off and the growth-death trade-off. The nutrient supply was modeled as discrete stochastic events, capturing realistic temporal fluctuations. We show that the relative balance between growth and death rates critically influences the dominance of either generalist or specialist strategies. Specifically, under conditions of high average growth rates among different environments and a weak trade-off between growth and death rates, generalists prevail. In contrast, when the growth-death trade-off is intense, specialists emerge as the dominant strategy. Our findings reveal that accounting for the growth-death trade-off is crucial for understanding how microbial communities adapt and evolve in temporally varying environments.</description>
