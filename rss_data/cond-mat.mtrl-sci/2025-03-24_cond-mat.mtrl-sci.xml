      <title>Impact of UC2, UC, UBC and UB2 target compositions on the release of fission products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The release properties of 4 targets (UC2, UC, UBC, UB2) were measured for 11 elements (Kr, Sr, Ru, Sn, Sb, Te, I, Cs, Ba, La, and Ce) using an off-line technique. The crystal packing fraction and the size of the studied element play a key role in the release process. However, physicochemical properties are also involved, notably melting and boiling points in vacuum and the minimal oxidation state. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the interrelationships between the physicochemical properties of fission products (from Fe to Dy) and the observed releases, thereby enabling predictions to be made about the release properties of the four crystallic configurations for elements that are inaccessible in off-line experiments.</description>

      <title>Surface properties of Co$_2$MnAl Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the plane-wave pseudopotential method within the framework of density functional theory, Co$_2$MnAl (100), (110), and (111) surfaces with different atomic terminations have been studied in the context of some key spintronics properties, viz., surface energy, half-metallicity, magnetization, and magnetic anisotropy. The present study reveals that the MnAl-(100), Co-Al-(111), and Al-(111) surfaces exhibit negative surface energies over a wide range of chemical potentials, indicating their strong structural stability. The MnAl-(100), CoCoMnAl-(110), and Co-Mn-(111) surfaces maintain the nearly half-metallic nature like the bulk-Co$_2$MnAl, while this nearly half-metallic nature even improved for the Al-(111) surface. In contrast, the rest of the considered surfaces, CoCo-(100), Co-Al-(111) and Mn-(111) surfaces, display the strong metallic nature. Magnetization is enhanced for most surface configurations, except for Al-(111), where it decreases due to reduced moments of the exterior atoms. Regarding magnetic anisotropy, only the MnAl-(100) and Co-Mn-(111) surfaces exhibit the positive magneto-crystalline anisotropy of $\sim$0.23 and $\sim$0.33 mJ/m2, respectively. All these findings suggest that the Co-Mn-(111) and MnAl-(100) surfaces are quite appealing for spintronics applications, considering the structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable anomalous Hall plateau in antiferromagnet CoNb$_3$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect represent a fascinating convergence of magnetism, topology, and electronic structure. Identifying antiferromagnets with large and tunable anomalous Hall effects is crucial for the development of spintronic applications. Here, we report a strain-tunable anomalous Hall plateau in CoNb$_3$S$_6$, which is a prime candidate for altermagnetism. The plateau emerges as a flat extended intermediate step of the anomalous Hall hysteresis loop with a controllable step height with temperature and strain. The remarkable tunability of the plateau position is in contrast with typical magnetic plateau associated with a field-induced metastable magnetic structure, but indicates the existence of a hidden phase transition that significantly alters the magnetic anisotropy energy without changing the magnetic order. The symmetry analysis of the strain tuning suggests that the hidden phase preserves the rotational symmetry of the ab-plane. Our results show the plateau reflects the phase coexistence during the hidden transition, and anomalous Hall resistivity of the plateau is thus non-volatile, enabling a novel four-state switching of the anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Atomic Origins of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ru-substituted Manganite Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in complex oxides often originates from the complex interplay of several factors, including crystal structure, spin-orbit coupling, and electronic interactions. Recent studies on Ru-substituted $La_{0.70}Sr_{0.30}MnO_3$ (Ru-LSMO) films demonstrate emerging magnetic and magneto-transport properties, where magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role. However, the atomic origin and underlying mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy of this material system remain elusive. This work sheds light on these aspects. Detailed element-specific X-ray magnetic dichroism analysis suggests that Ru single ion anisotropy governs the overall magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the magnetic property of Mn ions changes dramatically due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ru and Mn ions. Our findings clarify the role of Ru single ion anisotropy behind magnetic anisotropy in Ru-LSMO, offering a promising avenue for designing advanced materials with tailored magnetic properties for next generation magnetic and spintronic technologies. As the Curie temperature of these materials is close to room temperature, such tunable magnetic anisotropy holds prospects for functional room-temperature magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Magnetization Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves Enabled by Heat Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study laser-induced ultrafast magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic spin valve by comparing the effect of a direct laser excitation and an ultrashort hot-electron pulse. A wedged Cu layer is grown on top of the spin valve in order to tune the energy transmission to the magnetic stack, for both optical and hot-electron pulses. We demonstrate single-pulse magnetization reversal of the free layer by a hot-electron pulse. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. These results suggest that free layer heating plays a significant role in magnetization reversal. This work contributes to the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal due to nonlocal heat and spin transport occurring under strongly out-of-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent giant orbital moments and transport feature in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a great interest in orbital related electronics (also termed as orbitronics). In the current work, we present a first-principles density functional theory calculation on the orbital magnetic moments, intrinsic orbital Hall effect, and ordinary magnetoconductivity effects in rhombohedral graphene multilayers. Our calculations suggest a giant orbital moment that arises from inter-atomic cycloid motion, reaching over 30 muB under an intermediate gate voltage. This leads to a valley polarization under an external magnetic field, as observed in recent experiments [Nature 623, 41-47 (2023)]. In addition, the orbital-related transport feature exhibit significant responses that are potentially observed in experiments. We also suggest that under a periodic field driven (such as high frequency light field), the ungated graphene multilayers could host strong quantum anomalous and orbital Hall effects, engineered by the layer number. As the graphene multilayers are intrinsically nonmagnetic with negligible spin-orbit coupling, the orbital moments would not be entangled by spin-related signals. Thus, they serve as an ideal platform to conduct orbitronic measurements and utilization for next generation information read/write nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Unraveling phase transformation with phononic hyperbolicity using off-resonant terahertz light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncontacting and nondestructive control of geometric phase in conventional semiconductors plays a pivotal role in various applications. In the current work, we present a theoretical and computational investigation on terahertz (THz) light-induced phase transformation of conventional binary semiconducting compounds among different structures including rock-salt, zinc-blende, wurtzite, and hexagonal phases. Using MgS and MgSe as prototypical examples, we perform anharmonic phonon mediated calculations and reveal large contrasting lattice contributed dielectric susceptibility in the THz regime. We then construct a THz-induced phase diagram under intermediate temperature and reveal rock-salt to hexagonal and then wurtzite structure transformations with increasing light intensity. This does not require a high temperature environment as observed in traditional experiments. The low energy barrier suggests that the phase transition kinetics can be fast, and the stable room temperature phonon dispersions guarantee their non-volatile nature. Furthermore, we disclose the phononic hyperbolicity with strong anisotropic THz susceptibility components, which serves as a natural hyperbolic material with negative refractive index. Our work suggests the potential to realize metastable hidden phases using noninvasive THz irradiation, which expands the conventional pressure-temperature ($P-T$) phase diagram by adding light as an additional control factor.</description>

      <title>Multi-property directed generative design of inorganic materials through Wyckoff-augmented transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated materials discovery is an urgent demand to drive advancements in fields such as energy conversion, storage, and catalysis. Property-directed generative design has emerged as a transformative approach for rapidly discovering new functional inorganic materials with multiple desired properties within vast and complex search spaces. However, this approach faces two primary challenges: data scarcity for functional properties and the multi-objective optimization required to balance competing tasks. Here, we present a multi-property-directed generative framework designed to overcome these limitations and enhance site symmetry-compliant crystal generation beyond P1 (translational) symmetry. By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data augmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse and small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials simultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation energy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically and lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and cubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their thermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability for thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents a significant step forward in generative design of inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced phase transitions and lattice deformation in 2D NbOX$_{2}$ (X=Cl, Br, I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of light-induced phase transitions and strain in two-dimensional NbOX$_{2}$ (X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations. In particular, we identify a light-induced ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition in these 2D systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the possibility of inducing an antiferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition under illumination. Additionally, we find that these 2D systems exhibit significant photostrictive behavior, adding a new functionality to their already notable optical properties. The ability to control and manipulate ferroelectric order in these nanoscale materials through external stimuli, such as light, holds considerable promise for the development of next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological blocking at the Bi(111) surface due to surface relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of Bi and its alloys with Sb have fueled intense debate since the prediction of three-dimensional topological insulators. However, a definitive resolution has not been reached to date. Here, we provide theoretical evidence that surface relaxation conceals the underlying bulk topology of pure Bi. Using density functional theory calculations for thin Bi(111) films (up to 17 bilayers), we first demonstrate a substantial inter-bilayer expansion near the surface. Motivated by this finding, we extend our analysis to thick Bi(111) films (up to 250 bilayers) incorporating relaxation layers, within the framework of a relativistic empirical tight-binding model. Our results reveal that these relaxation layers topologically block the emergence of surface state and significantly suppress the one-particle spectrum of surface states, thereby obscuring the experimental identification of Bi's topological properties. This phenomenon, which we term "topological blocking", provides crucial insights into the long-standing difficulty of observing surface states of Bi(111) at the $\bar{M}$ point. Furthermore, it establishes a framework for understanding and predicting the topological behavior in systems where surface relaxation disrupts the bulk-edge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Tunable Magneto-optical Kerr effect in two-dimensional non-collinear antiferromagnetic material HfFeCl6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is widely used to measure ferromagnetism in 2D systems. Although this effect is usually inactive in antiferromagnets (AFM), recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the presence of MOKE relies on the symmetry of the system and antiferromagnets with noncollinear magnetic order can also induce a significant MOKE signal even without a net magnetization. However, this phenomenon is rarely studied in 2D systems due to a scarcity of appropriate materials hosting noncollinear AFM order. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the HfFeCl6 monolayer with noncollinear Y-AFM ground states, which simultaneously breaks the time-reversal (T) and time-inversion (TI) symmetry, activating the MOKE even though with zero net magnetic moment. In addition, four different MOKE spectra can be obtained in the four permutation states of spin chirality and crystal chirality. The MOKE spectra are switchable when reversing both crystal and spin chirality. Our study provides a material platform to explore the MOKE effect and can potentially be used for electrical readout of AFM states.</description>

      <title>Designing Non-Relativistic Spin Splitting in Oxide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of atomic distortions in non-relativistic spin splitting in perovskite oxides with Pbnm symmetry. Using LaMnO3 as a representative material, we analyze its non-relativistic spin splitting through a combined phonon and multipolar analysis. Our study provides key insights into how structural distortions and magnetic ordering drive ferroically ordered magnetic multipoles, which, in turn, give rise to non-relativistic spin splitting. Based on these findings, we propose three strategies for engineering non-relativistic spin splitting: modifying the A-site cation size, strain engineering, and electric field control in superlattice structures. Our work establishes a framework for designing non-relativistic spin splitting in the Brillouin zone of oxide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Controlled Rotation of Magnetic Anisotropy in the Ni90Fe10/BaTiO3(001) Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the voltage control of magnetic anisotropy in a strain-mediated Ni90Fe10/BaTiO3(001) heterostructure. In the pristine state of the heterostructure, the Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect measurements show a transcritical hysteresis loop for the Ni90Fe10 film, indicating a weak perpendicular anisotropy. This was further confirmed by X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism - Photoemission Electron Microscopy, revealing stripe domains in this film. X-ray diffraction analysis of the BaTiO3 substrate under varying electric fields was used to analyze the orientation of ferroelectric domains. These results indicated that BaTiO3 exhibits two distinct states depending on the applied electric field: one with domains aligned with the electric field and another with random domain orientation when the field is removed. After substrate poling, the Ni90Fe10 layer switches from weak perpendicular anisotropy to an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, with the in-plane direction of anisotropy being controllable by 90{\deg} through an electric field. This effect is due to an efficient strain transfer from BaTiO3 to the Ni90Fe10 lattice, induced by ferroelectric polarization, as shown by XRD. Remarkably, this rotation of the magnetic anisotropy leads to an enhanced converse magnetoelectric coupling value of 1.43 {\mu}s/m, surpassing previously reported values for other BaTiO3-based heterostructures by an order of magnitude. These results emphasize the potential of Ni90Fe10 alloys for next-generation magnetoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>PINK: physical-informed machine learning for lattice thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial for efficient thermal management in electronics and energy conversion technologies. Traditional methods for predicting \k{appa}L are often computationally expensive, limiting their scalability for large-scale material screening. Empirical models, such as the Slack model, offer faster alternatives but require time-consuming calculations for key parameters such as sound velocity and the Gruneisen parameter. This work presents a high-throughput framework, physical-informed kappa (PINK), which combines the predictive power of crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs) with the physical interpretability of the Slack model to predict \k{appa}L directly from crystallographic information files (CIFs). Unlike previous approaches, PINK enables rapid, batch predictions by extracting material properties such as bulk and shear modulus from CIFs using a well-trained CGCNN model. These properties are then used to compute the necessary parameters for $\kappa_L$ calculation through a simplified physical formula.

      <title>Correlation of the role of Li-doping in control of O-vacancies and Li interstitial formations in NiO with electrochemical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aliovalent doping in an oxide material introduces modifications in the valence state of the host cation and often leads to tailoring the oxygen content in the lattice. Moreover, if the dopant cation is larger than the host cation, the lattice strain and disorder may be affected. Such changes are expected to modify the electronic clouds and lead to different ligand fields, which in turn should modify the bond lengths, and therefore phonons, electronic properties, transport properties, and charge storage properties. To understand such correlations an example is being investigated in this study by doping a larger Li+ ion in a NiO lattice. The effect on structure, phonons, electronic properties, and charge storage properties are investigated and correlated in a first-of-its-kind report. The charge storage properties are observed to improve with Li+ doping until 3% substitution and thereafter decrease due to the generation of Li+ interstitial in a 6% incorporated sample. The connection of oxygen vacancies and Ni3+ formation with Li+ incorporation is the backbone of this report.</description>

      <title>High-throughput study of kagome compounds in the AV3Sb5 family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density waves, and topologically nontrivial states. While AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds have been extensively studied in this context, the broader AB3C5 family remains largely unexplored. In this work, we employ machine-learning-accelerated, high-throughput density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the stability and electronic properties of kagome materials derived from atomic substitutions in the AV3Sb5 structure. We identify 36 promising candidates that are thermodynamically stable, with many more close to the convex hull. Stable compounds are not only found with a pnictogen (Sb or Bi) as the C atom but also with Au, Hg, Tl, and Ce. This diverse chemistry opens the way to tune the electronic properties of the compounds. In fact, many of these compounds exhibit Dirac points, Van Hove singularities, or flat bands close to the Fermi level. Our findings provide an array of compounds for experimental synthesis and further theoretical exploration of kagome superconductors beyond the already known systems.</description>

      <title>A model of full thermodynamic stabilization of nanocrystalline alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of a polycrystalline alloy combining the Potts model for grain orientations with a lattice-gas model for solute thermodynamics and diffusion. The alloy evolution with this model is implemented by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with nonlinear transition barriers between the states. The model is applied to investigate the long-standing question of whether grain boundary (GB) segregation of an appropriate solute can drive the GB free energy to zero, creating a fully stabilized polycrystalline state with a finite grain size. The model reproduces stable polycrystalline states under certain conditions, provided the solute-solute interactions are repulsive. The structure minimizing the total free energy is not static. It exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium between the competing processes of grain growth and grain refinement. The alloy eliminates triple junctions by forming a set of smaller grains embedded into a larger matrix grain. It is predicted that, if a fully stabilized nanocrystalline state is implemented experimentally, it will look very different from the conventional (unstable) nanocrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electronic and Optical Properties of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ by Introducing B, Y, and Nb Dopants for Improved Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced theoretical investigations are crucial for understanding the structural growth mechanisms, optoelectronic properties, and photocatalytic activity of photoelectrodes for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. In this work, we conducted first-principles calculations aimed at designing $\alpha$-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes incorporating mono-dopants such as boron (B), yttrium (Y), and niobium (Nb), as well as co-dopants (B, Y) and (B, Nb) to enhance the performance of photoelectrochemical cells. We assessed the thermodynamic phase stability by calculating formation enthalpy ($E_f$) and examining material properties, including microstrain ($\mu_\epsilon$) and crystallite size ($D$). The mono-dopants, Y and Nb, and the co-dopants, (B, Y) and (B, Nb), exhibited negative $E_f$ values under the substitutional doping method, confirming their thermodynamic phase stability and suggesting their practical viability for experimental implementation. Notably, the values of $\mu_\epsilon$ and $D$ fell within the ranges observed experimentally for $\alpha$-Fe2O3, indicating their effectiveness in growth mechanisms. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the optoelectronic properties of doped $\alpha$-Fe2O3, we calculated the electronic band structure, density of states, atom's ionic charge, and optical absorption coefficient. This analysis allowed us to examine the improvements in the electronic charge characteristics and photon-electron interactions. B-doped $\alpha$-Fe2O3 led to the formation of impurity bands, which were mitigated by utilizing co-dopants (B, Y) and (B, Nb). The metal dopants, Y and Nb, significantly increased the charge carrier density, while the co-dopants, (B, Y) and (B, Nb), substantially enhanced light absorption in the visible spectrum.</description>

      <title>Wafer scale reactive sputter deposition of ferroelectric Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N from 300 mm AlSc Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.</description>

      <title>Lattice Materials with Topological States Optimized On-Demand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological states of matter, first discovered in quantum systems, have opened new avenues for wave manipulation beyond the quantum realm. In elastic media, realizing these topological effects requires identifying lattices that support the corresponding topological bands. However, among the vast number of theoretically predicted topological states, only a small fraction has been physically realized. To close this gap, we present a new strategy capable of systematically and efficiently discovering metamaterials with any desired topological state. Our approach builds on topological quantum chemistry (TQC), which systematically classifies topological states by analyzing symmetry properties at selected wavevectors. Because this method condenses the topological character into mathematical information at a small set of wavevectors, it encodes a clear and computationally efficient objective for topology optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that, for certain lattice symmetries, this classification can be further reduced to intuitive morphological features of the phonon band structure. By incorporating these band morphology constraints into topology optimization algorithms and further fabricating obtained designs, we enable the automated discovery and physical realization of metamaterials with targeted topological properties. This methodology establishes a new paradigm for engineering topological elastic lattices on demand, addressing the bottleneck in material realization and paving the way for a comprehensive database of topological metamaterial configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in altermagnetism, a novel form of magnetism, characterized by unique spin-splitting even in the absence of both net magnetic moments and spin-orbit coupling. Despite numerous theoretical predictions, experimental evidence of such spin-splitting in real materials remains limited. In this study, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electronic band structure of the altermagnet candidate CoNb4Se8. This material features an ordered sublattice of intercalated Co atoms within NbSe2 layers. Magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements reveal the onset of antiferromagnetism below 168 K. Temperature dependent ARPES data, supported by DFT calculations, uncover spin split bands along the MGM high-symmetry direction. The observation of spin splitting in this high temperature altermagnet opens new avenues for exploring its electronic properties and potential applications in spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Perturbing finite temperature multicomponent DFT 1D Kohn-Sham systems: Peierls Gap &amp; Kohn Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the greatest challenges when designing new technologies that make use of non-trivial quantum materials is the difficulty associated with predicting material-specific properties, such as critical temperature, gap parameter, etc. There is naturally a great amount of interest in these types of condensed matter systems because of their application to quantum sensing, quantum electronics, and quantum computation; however, they are exceedingly difficult to address from first principles because of the famous many-body problem. For this reason, a full electron-nuclear quantum calculation will likely remain completely out of reach for the foreseeable future. A practical alternative is provided by finite temperature, multi component density functional theory (MCDFT), which is a formally exact method of computing the equilibrium state energy of a many-body quantum system. In this work, we use this construction alongside a perturbative scheme to demonstrate that the phenomena Peierls effect and Kohn Anomaly are both natural features of the KS equations without additional structure needed. We find the temperature dependent ionic density for a simple 1D lattice which is then used to derive the ionic densities temperature dependent affect on the electronic band structure. This is accomplished by Fourier transforming the ionic density term found within this KS electronic equation. Using the Peierls effect phonon distortion gap openings in relation to the Fermi level, we then perturb the KS ionic equation with a conduction electron density, deriving the Kohn Anomaly. This provides a workable predictive strategy for interesting electro-phonon related material properties which could be extended to 2D and 3D real materials while retaining the otherwise complicated temperature dependence.</description>

      <title>Development of High-Quality $\alpha$-Ta Film at Room Temperature via Seed Layer Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of high-quality superconducting thin film on silicon substrates is essential for quantum computing, and low signal interconnects with industrial compatibility. Recently, the growth of $\alpha$-Ta (alpha-phase tantalum) thin films has gained attention over conventional superconductors like Nb and Al due to their high-density native oxide ($Ta_2O_5$), which offers excellent chemical resistance, superior dielectric properties, and mechanical robustness. The growth of $\alpha$-Ta thin films can be achieved through high-temperature/cryogenic growth, ultra-thin seed layers, or thick films (&gt;300 nm). While high-temperature deposition produces high-quality films, it can cause thermal stress, silicide formation at the interface, and defects due to substrate-film mismatch. Room-temperature deposition minimizes these issues, benefiting heat-sensitive substrates and device fabrication. Low-temperature growth using amorphous (defective) seed layers such as TaN and TiN has shown promise for phase stabilization. However, nitrogen gas, used as a source of metallic nitride, can introduce defects and lead to the formation of amorphous seed layers. This study explores using crystalline seed layers to optimize $\alpha$-Ta thin films, demonstrating improved film quality, including reduced surface roughness, enhanced phase orientation, and higher transition temperatures compared to amorphous seed layers like metal nitrides. These advancements could interest the superconducting materials community for fabricating high-quality quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxide glasses have the structure of disordered covalent networks that are accountable for their mechanical response. Identifying the topological phenomena of the elastic structural response, we statistically backpropagate local regions that have the highest susceptibility of rearrangement. Shear transformation zones in network glasses highly correlate with regions of the highest variance in their bond stretch distributions projected into the direction of macroscopic deformation. However, directional influence is significantly less essential than bond stretch variance, which shows that shear transformation zones in network glasses are mainly state-dependent. Exclusively depending on the local geometry of the initial material state, our indicators are physically informing and can be evaluated directly from images with insignificant computational effort.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realizing a single photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, laying the foundation for next generation THz quantum technologies, a timely and significant research area given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of vortex gyrotropic mode excited by surface acoustic waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional method for exciting spin-wave dynamics in magnetic materials involves microwave magnetic fields generated by current injection into inductive antennas. However, there is a growing interest in non-inductive excitation methods. Magneto-acoustic effects present a viable alternative, where strains produced by applying voltages to a piezoelectric substrate can couple to spin-waves in a magnetic film. Recently, it has been proposed that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can excite the gyrotropic mode of the vortex state in a magnetic disk. Here we report on experiments utilizing a magnetic resonance force microscope to investigate magnetization dynamics in CoFeB sub-micrometer disks in the vortex state, grown on a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ substrate. The device design enables excitation of the gyrotropic mode either inductively, using an antenna on top of the disks, or acoustically via SAWs launched from an interdigital transducer. Our modelling indicates that the lattice rotation {\omega}xz generates a localized magneto-acoustic field that displaces the vortex core from the disk center, initiating the gyration motion. Tuning of the magneto-acoustic torque acting on the vortex structure is achieved by a perpendicular magnetic field. These results demonstrate the clear excitation of the vortex gyrotropic mode by magneto-acoustic excitation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy-Boosted Funnel Learning for Identifying Semiconductors with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) has demonstrated tremendous potential in material property predictions. However, the scarcity of materials data with costly property labels in the vast chemical space presents a significant challenge for ML in efficiently predicting properties and uncovering structure-property relationships. Here, we propose a novel hierarchy-boosted funnel learning (HiBoFL) framework, which is successfully applied to identify semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_\mathrm{L}$). By training on only a few hundred materials targeted by unsupervised learning from a pool of hundreds of thousands, we achieve efficient and interpretable supervised predictions of ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$, thereby circumventing large-scale brute-force \textit{ab initio} calculations without clear objectives. As a result, we provide a list of candidates with ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ for potential thermoelectric applications and discover a new factor that significantly influences structural anharmonicity. This HiBoFL framework offers a novel practical pathway for accelerating the discovery of functional materials.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior, paving the way for the design of HE-resistant materials.</description>

      <title>Reactive sputtering of SnS thin films using sulfur plasma and a metallic tin target: achieving stoichiometry and large grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for fabricating stoichiometric SnS thin films with large grain sizes via reactive sputtering using a metallic Sn target and sulfur plasma (S-plasma). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on toxic H2S gas, this method employs a S-plasma to enhance sulfur reactivity and mitigate sulfur deficiencies during film deposition. By optimizing the balance between the sputtering conditions of the Sn target and the supply conditions of the S-plasma, dense single-phase SnS thin films with micron-scale grain sizes were achieved at a substrate temperature of 300 degree C, achieving an in-plane Hall mobility of 13 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, crystalline SnS thin films were fabricated even on a room-temperature substrate, enabling potential applications in flexible devices with heat-sensitive substrates. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of S-plasma in advancing SnS thin film fabrication, providing a safer and more efficient route to high-performance photovoltaic materials.</description>

      <title>Chemical Foundation Model Guided Design of High Ionic Conductivity Electrolyte Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing optimal formulations is a major challenge in developing electrolytes for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to the vast combinatorial design space and complex interplay between multiple constituents. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to uncover underlying chemical design rules and accelerate the process of formulation discovery. In this work, we present an approach to design new formulations that can achieve target performance, using a generalizable chemical foundation model. The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.</description>

      <title>BaZrS$_\text{3}$ Lights Up: The Interplay of Electrons, Photons, and Phonons in Strongly Luminescent Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, with BaZrS$_\text{3}$ attracting significant attention due to its wide bandgap, earth-abundant composition, and thermal and chemical stability. However, previous studies have consistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of synthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality of this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated PL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\text{3}$ single crystals. Despite the narrow, single-component PL emission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of $1.0\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier lifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and their symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our results indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and strong electron-phonon coupling contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on compositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate electron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes. By establishing a detailed reference for the intrinsic vibrational and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS$_\text{3}$, this work paves the way for further advancements in chalcogenide perovskites for energy and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>A gradient atmospheric model reveals enhanced radiative cooling potential and demonstrates the advantages of broadband emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive radiative cooling toward the sky is a developing technology for adaptation in hot climates. Previous calculations of cooling performance have generally used uniform atmospheric models that assume a single sky temperature and atmospheric transmittance spectrum. Here, we introduce a gradient atmospheric model that accounts for altitude-dependent temperature and gas composition, revealing that uniform models underestimate cooling power by 10 - 40%. Using our improved model, we systematically compared broadband emitters (BEs) and wavelength-selective emitters (SEs) for sky-facing radiative cooling at various locations on Earth. We find that the differences in cooling power between the two types of emitters in the sub-ambient temperature range are generally small, even under ideal conditions. Furthermore, in practice, BEs actually have superior performance than realistic SEs, because they have fewer design degrees of freedom and thus can be engineered to have lower solar absorption. Our analysis suggests that large-scale deployment of sky-facing passive radiative cooling technologies should prioritize the development of scalable, low-cost surfaces with minimal solar absorption, rather than focusing on achieving selective thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP), calls for a minimal mechanism not invoking the spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The phonon mean-free-path is close to the sample thickness. Therefore, it is unlikely that scattering by point-like symmetry-breaking defects play a major role. We show that the angular dependence of the signal can be mapped to the sum of two sinusoidal components each peaking when the magnetic field is parallel to a high symmetry. We propose that anharmonicity may play a major role and argue that the magnetic field can exert a torque on electric dipolar waves traveling with phonons.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Random packing fraction of binary hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (athermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>

      <title>Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D GU tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-3DAR.</description>
