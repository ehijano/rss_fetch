      <title>Role of Data-driven Regional Growth Model in Shaping Brain Folding Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface morphology of the developing mammalian brain is crucial for understanding brain function and dysfunction. Computational modeling offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms for early brain folding. While previous studies generally assume uniform growth, recent findings indicate significant regional variations in brain tissue growth. However, the role of these variations in cortical development remains unclear. In this study, we explored how regional cortical growth affects brain folding patterns. We first developed growth models for typical cortical regions using ML-assisted symbolic regression, based on longitudinal data from over 1,000 infant MRI scans that captured cortical surface area and thickness during perinatal and postnatal brains development. These models were subsequently integrated into computational software to simulate cortical development with anatomically realistic geometric models. We quantified the resulting folding patterns using metrics such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, and gyrification index. Our results demonstrate that regional growth models generate complex brain folding patterns that more closely match actual brains structures, both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to uniform growth models. Growth magnitude plays a dominant role in shaping folding patterns, while growth trajectory has a minor influence. Moreover, multi-region models better capture the intricacies of brain folding than single-region models. Our results underscore the necessity and importance of incorporating regional growth heterogeneity into brain folding simulations, which could enhance early diagnosis and treatment of cortical malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy and autism.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning Abductive Reasoning using VSA Distributed Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a model that solves abstract reasoning tasks based on Learn-VRF. ARLC features a novel and more broadly applicable training objective for abductive reasoning, resulting in better interpretability and higher accuracy when solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM). ARLC allows both programming domain knowledge and learning the rules underlying a data distribution. We evaluate ARLC on the I-RAVEN dataset, showcasing state-of-the-art accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (unseen attribute-rule pairs) tests. ARLC surpasses neuro-symbolic and connectionist baselines, including large language models, despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We show ARLC's robustness to post-programming training by incrementally learning from examples on top of programmed knowledge, which only improves its performance and does not result in catastrophic forgetting of the programmed solution. We validate ARLC's seamless transfer learning from a 2x2 RPM constellation to unseen constellations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/abductive-rule-learner-with-context-awareness.</description>
