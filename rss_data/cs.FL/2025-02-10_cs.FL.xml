      <title>Robust Probabilistic Model Checking with Continuous Reward Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic model checking traditionally verifies properties on the expected value of a measure of interest. This restriction may fail to capture the quality of service of a significant proportion of a system's runs, especially when the probability distribution of the measure of interest is poorly represented by its expected value due to heavy-tail behaviors or multiple modalities. Recent works inspired by distributional reinforcement learning use discrete histograms to approximate integer reward distribution, but they struggle with continuous reward space and present challenges in balancing accuracy and scalability. We propose a novel method for handling both continuous and discrete reward distributions in Discrete Time Markov Chains using moment matching with Erlang mixtures. By analytically deriving higher-order moments through Moment Generating Functions, our method approximates the reward distribution with theoretically bounded error while preserving the statistical properties of the true distribution. This detailed distributional insight enables the formulation and robust model checking of quality properties based on the entire reward distribution function, rather than restricting to its expected value. We include a theoretical foundation ensuring bounded approximation errors, along with an experimental evaluation demonstrating our method's accuracy and scalability in practical model-checking problems.</description>

      <title>Kunz languages for numerical semigroups are context sensitive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a one-to-one and onto correspondence between the class of numerical semigroups of depth $n$, where $n$ is an integer, and a certain language over the alphabet $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ which we call a Kunz language of depth $n$. The Kunz language associated with the numerical semigroups of depth $2$ is the regular language $\{1,2\}^*2\{1,2\}^*$. We prove that Kunz languages associated with numerical semigroups of larger depth are context-sensitive but not regular.</description>

      <title>Regular Grammars for Sets of Graphs of Tree-Width $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular word grammars are context-free grammars having restricted
  rules, that define all recognizable languages of words. This paper
  generalizes regular grammars from words to certain classes of
  graphs, by defining regular grammars for unordered unranked trees
  and graphs of tree-width $2$ at most. The qualifier ``regular'' is
  justified because these grammars define precisely the recognizable
  (equivalently, \cmso-definable) sets of the respective graph
  classes. The proof of equivalence between regular and recognizable
  sets of graphs relies on the effective construction of a recognizer
  algebra of size doubly-exponential in the size of the grammar. This
  sets a \twoexptime\ upper bound on the (\exptime-hard) problem of
  inclusion of a context-free language in a regular language, for
  graphs of tree-width $2$ at most. A further syntactic restriction of
  regular grammars suffices to capture precisely the \mso-definable
  sets of graphs of tree-width $2$ at most, i.e., the sets defined by
  \cmso\ formul{\ae} without cardinality constraints. Moreover, we
  show that \mso-definability coincides with recognizability by
  algebras having an aperiodic parallel composition semigroup, for
  each class of graphs defined by a bound on the tree-width.</description>
