      <title>Turbulence in Simulated Local Cluster Analogs: one-to-one comparisons between SLOW and XRISM/Hitomi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XRISM Resolve X-ray spectrometer allows to gain detailed insight into gas motions of the intra cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Current simulation studies focus mainly on statistical comparisons, making the comparison to the currently still small number of clusters difficult due to unknown selection effects. This study aims to bridge this gap, using simulated counterparts of Coma, Virgo, and Perseus from the SLOW constrained simulations. These clusters show excellent agreement in their properties and dynamical state with observations, thus providing an ideal testbed to understand the processes shaping the properties of the ICM. We find that the simulations match the order of the amount of turbulence for the three considered clusters, Coma being the most active, followed by Perseus, while Virgo is very relaxed. Typical turbulent velocities are a few $\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, very close to observed values. The resulting turbulent pressure support is $\approx1\%$ for Virgo and $\approx 3-4\%$ for Perseus and Coma within the central $1-2\%$ of $R_{200}$. Compared to previous simulations and observations, measured velocities and turbulent pressure support are consistently lower, in line with XRISM findings, thus indicating the importance of selection effects.</description>

      <title>Constraining compact dark matter with time-varying quasar equivalent widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the possible explanations for dark matter is that of compact dark objects of baryonic origin, such as black holes or even planets. Accumulating evidence, including the discovery of merging stellar mass black holes through gravitational waves, point to a population of such objects making up at least some fraction of dark matter. We revisit a historically heavily used probe, quasar spectra, from the new perspective of time variability and gravitational lensing. From a sample of 777 quasars selected from archival data we identify 19 that show decisive evidence of lensing by compact objects with masses measured in the range $5\times 10^{-5} &lt; M/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; 2\times 10^{-2}$ with 99\% confidence. This is much lower than what is hoped to be detected by even the most futuristic gravitational wave detectors and analysis strategies, but is crucial for theories of compact dark matter, such as primordial black holes predicted from quantum phase transitions in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Envisioning the Distance Ladder in the Era of the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art cosmic distance ladder requires three rungs--geometric distances, primary indicators, and Type Ia Supernovae--to achieve a 1% measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. The Habitable Worlds Observatory will have the sensitivity and resolution to reduce this to a two-step measurement, eliminating the third rung entirely and reaching into the Hubble flow with stellar distance indicators such as Cepheid variables and the tip of the red giant branch alone. We discuss the requirements for a program to measure $H_0$ to 1% with HWO here, including telescope and instrument design considerations. We also comment on the potential of HWO to measure distances to low-mass dwarf galaxies via their RR Lyrae stars.</description>

      <title>Do Pulsar Timing Datasets Favor Massive Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several observational phenomena suggest that the standard model of cosmology and particle physics requires revision. To address this, we consider the extension of general relativity known as massive gravity (MG). In this Letter, we explore the imprints of MG on the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs): their modified dispersion relation and their additional (two vector and one scalar) polarization modes on the stochastic GW background (SGWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We analyze the effects of massive GWs on the Hellings-Downs curve induced by modification of the overlap reduction function. Our study consists of analyzing observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the Chinese PTA Data Release I, and is independent of the origin of the SGWB (astrophysical or cosmological). By considering the bound on the graviton mass imposed through the dispersion relation, we scrutinize the possibility of detecting traces of MG in the PTA observational data. We find that massive GWs predict better fits for the observed pulsar correlations. Future PTA missions with more precise data will hopefully be able to detect the GW additional polarization modes and might be effectively used to constrain the graviton mass.</description>

      <title>Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in AGN as a precursor of multi-messaging gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables bidirectional mapping between parameters and acoustic peak features. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves an accuracy of $0.03\%$over $\ell \leq 2510$, while PolyCAMB-peak also reaches sub-percent accuracy and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>On the width and profiles of cosmic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the widths and profiles of cosmic filaments using the IllustrisTNG simulations. Filaments were identified with DisPerSE, using galaxy samples in simulations as input. Since the width of an individual filament can vary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with lengths between $1.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and measure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments increases gradually from approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z = 2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment width correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent with previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the segment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential estimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments with different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified formula akin to the isothermal $\beta$-model. For segments with a given width, the rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z = 0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the center to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas than thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal profiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 simulations, and align well with results from earlier studies. We briefly discuss the potential implications and applications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Angular correlation functions of bright Lyman-break galaxies at $\mathbf{3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering of Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts of 3 $\lesssim z \lesssim$ 5 within the COSMOS field by measuring the angular two-point correlation function. Our robust sample of $\sim$60,000 bright ($m_{\rm UV}\lesssim 27$) Lyman-break galaxies was selected based on spectral energy distribution fitting across 14 photometric bands spanning optical and near-infrared wavelengths. We constrained both the 1- and 2-halo terms at separations up to 300 arcsec, finding an excess in the correlation function at scales corresponding to $&lt;20$ kpc, consistent with enhancement due to clumps in the same galaxy or interactions on this scale. We then performed Bayesian model fits on the correlation functions to infer the Halo Occupation Distribution parameters, star formation duty cycle, and galaxy bias in three redshift bins. We examined several cases where different combinations of parameters were varied, showing that our data can constrain the slope of the satellite occupation function, which previous studies have fixed. For an $M_{\rm{UV}}$-limited sub-sample, we found galaxy bias values of $b_g=3.18^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ at $z\simeq3$, $b_g=3.58^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ at $z\simeq4$, $b_g=4.27^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ at $z\simeq5$. The duty cycle values are $0.62^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$, $0.40^{+0.34}_{-0.22}$, and $0.39^{+0.31}_{-0.20}$, respectively. These results suggest that, as the redshift increases, there is a slight decrease in the host halo masses and a shorter timescale for star formation in bright galaxies, at a fixed rest-frame UV luminosity threshold.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Axion USR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of inflation in which the inflaton field is a rolling axion with a potential which is flat enough to support an intermediate phase of USR inflation. Because of the Chern-Simons interaction, one polarization of the gauge field experiences the tachyonic growth during the first slow-roll stage, inducing large corrections in curvature perturbations via the inverse decay effect. A non-trivial feature of our setup is that once the system enters the USR phase, the instability parameter falls off rapidly, terminating the gauge field production efficiently. Consequently, the power spectrum involves two separate peaks, the first peak is induced by the gauge field particles production while the second peak is due to standard USR mechanism. We show that the power spectrum at the intermediate scales develops strong scale-dependence $\propto k^m$ with the index $m &gt;4$. Calculating the bispectrum, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianities with non-trivial shapes and multiple peaks are generated in this setup.</description>

      <title>Cosmic structure from the path integral of classical mechanics and its comparison to standard perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that non-perturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Twisted echoes of an odd quartet}$: Scalar-induced gravitational waves as a probe of primordial parity-violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-violation leaves tell-tale trails in many cosmological observables. We illustrate parity-odd primordial scalar trispectra, that despite being of modest strength, impart detectable chirality to scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). This allows us to impose strong bounds on the parity-odd part of trispectrum. Over certain scales, we find SIGW directly quantify parity-violation in primordial non-Gaussianity, unobscured by the Gaussian contribution. Our results call for treatment of SIGW and parity-odd trispectrum as complementary predictions of parity-violating theories.</description>

      <title>Relativistic accretion and burdened primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the joint effects of relativistic accretion and memory burdened evaporation on the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs). The memory burden effect, which delays the evaporation by inducing a backreaction and making the evaporation rate scale as an inverse power law of the PBH entropy, opens up a new window that allows PBHs with $M \lesssim 10^{15}~\mathrm{g}$ to survive until the present epoch. Meanwhile, accretion increases the mass of PBHs, thereby enhancing their chances of survival for a given initial mass. We consider two main scenarios: one where PBHs evaporate completely before big bang nucleosynthesis, and another where PBHs persist until today. In the case of evaporation, we analyse the emission of dark matter (DM) and dark radiation (DR) during the process of evaporation. Conversely, in the other case, the surviving PBHs themselves can contribute as DM. We further investigate how relativistic and non-relativistic accretion, together with memory burdened evaporation, impact the parameter space of the emitted DM, the abundance of stable PBHs as DM, and the contribution of DR to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$.</description>

Abstract: The Cosmological Principle posits that the Universe is isotropic on the largest scales. While widely supported, this foundational assumption remains testable. We analyse the angular distribution of over one million quasars from the Gaia-unWISE catalogue using Renyi entropy, a multiscale statistical measure sensitive to higher-order clustering. Dividing the sample into three redshift bins, we find that both the low- and high-redshift distributions are statistically consistent with isotropy. However, at intermediate redshift ($1 \leq z &lt; 2.2$), we detect a statistically significant and scale-dependent anisotropy that persists under stringent masking, suggesting a physical origin. We interpret this as evidence for a transitional epoch in cosmic history, during which large-scale structures such as superclusters became prominent before their growth was gradually damped by the onset of accelerated expansion. These findings position Renyi entropy as a powerful probe of cosmic evolution and highlight the potential thermodynamic links between structure formation, entropy dissipation, and the emergence of large-scale isotropy.</description>

      <title>From Fluctuation to Polarization: Imprints of $O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ Curvature Perturbations in CMB B-modes from Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing primordial curvature perturbations on small scales, beyond those accessible using cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, remains a major open challenge. Current constraints on the scalar power spectrum at these scales are either weak or rely heavily on model-dependent assumptions about small-scale structure. In this work, we propose a novel method to probe the small-scale primordial power spectrum using scalar-induced tensor perturbations, which are inevitably sourced by curvature perturbations at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While induced tensor modes have traditionally been studied in the context of the stochastic gravitational wave background, we highlight a complementary observable: the distinctive pattern of B-mode polarization they imprint on the CMB. We compute the angular spectrum of these B-modes arising from enhanced scalar perturbations and show that the resulting signal can be competitive with inflationary predictions for values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio targeted in upcoming CMB experiments, most notably CMB-Stage 4. We map the region of the scalar power spectrum to which these future B-mode experiments will be sensitive and compare with existing constraints, finding it to exceed current sensitivities at $k \sim O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In addition to providing a new CMB-based probe of the small-scale power spectrum, this work also motivates dedicated B-mode searches at higher multipoles ($\ell \gtrsim 100$).</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Ionizing Photon Luminosity Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting the number and brightness of ionizing radiation sources out to a redshift of z ~ 1.2 will revolutionize our understanding of how the ionizing background is created and sustained by the embedded growth of meta-galactic structures. The shear number of sparsely separated targets required to efficiently construct redshift binned luminosity functions is industrial in scale, driving the need for low spectral resolution multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) with a short wavelength cut-off ~ 1000 {\AA}, a sensitivity in the far-UV to better than 30 abmag, and an instantaneous field-of-view ~ (2')$^2$. A MOS on Habitable Worlds Observatory is the only instrument that could conceivably carry out such an ambitious observing program.</description>

      <title>ACT-Inspired Kaehler-Based Inflationary Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with the recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler potentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the inflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1&lt; p&lt;10. The combination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4) within a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are consistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n. Endowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity realization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The attainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional attractive features of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Inflation Model Based on Virasoro Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for realizing slow-roll inflation that is fully consistent with observational data, based on conformal transformations acting exclusively on a complex scalar field -- without coupling to the gravitational sector. These transformations generically produce a plateau in the inflaton potential, as guaranteed by the maximum modulus theorem, thereby naturally satisfying the slow-roll conditions.
  Our framework utilizes squeezing operations generated by the Virasoro algebra without central extension, as developed in our earlier work. The resulting inflationary potentials depend on the Virasoro mode $n$, the power $m$ of the original potential, and the squeezing parameter $\theta$.
  We present approximate analytical expressions at leading order for the special case $n=-2$, and perform numerical analyses for both $n=-2$ and other values of $n$. These reveal parameter regimes in which the predicted cosmological observables $(n_{s},r)$ align remarkably well with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>The dark matter content of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and $0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous measurements and data sets.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <title>COSINUS -- a model-independent challenge of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter claim with cryogenic NaI detectors operated in a new low-background facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature detectors are a powerful technology for dark matter search, offering excellent energy resolution and low energy thresholds. COSINUS is the only experiment that combines scintillating sodium iodide (NaI) crystals with an additional phonon readout at cryogenic temperatures, using superconducting sensors (remoTES), alongside the conventional scintillation light signal. Via the simultaneous phonon and scintillation light detection, a unique event-by-event particle identification is enabled. This dual-channel approach allows for a model-independent cross-check of the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA signal with a moderate exposure of a few hundred kg d, while completely avoiding key systematic uncertainties inherent to scintillation-only NaI-based searches. COSINUS built and commissioned a dedicated low-background cryogenic facility at the LNGS underground laboratories. Data taking with eight NaI detector modules (COSINUS1$\pi$ Run1) is planned to begin in late 2025.</description>

Abstract: The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most theories that attempt to reproduce the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology for dark matter at galactic scales rely on ad hoc free functions, preventing them from being regarded as fundamental. In this work, we present a new theory that reproduces MOND, built on a supposed to be fundamental Yang-Mills gauge field based on SU(2), with a gravitational coupling constant, and emerging in a low-acceleration regime, below the MOND acceleration scale. The gauge field plays the role of the internal force in the dipolar dark matter (DDM) model. We discuss how certain solutions of this theory recover the deep MOND regime without introducing arbitrary functions in the action. Within this framework, the MOND phenomenology appears to be due to the existence of a new sector of particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to a gauge field via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta, which can act as a source of gravitational waves (GWs) with potentially observable amplitudes. In this work, we investigate GW production in a spectator axion model when strong backreaction is taken into account. We find that decreasing the decay constant of the axion enhances GW production. Since the initial value of the axion is larger than its quantum fluctuations, such a condition imposes a lower bound on the axion dacay constant, which sets an upper bound on the amplitude of the energy spectrum of GWs. As a result, the amplitude of the predicted GW energy spectrum is lower than $10^{-10}$ in the nHz to mHz frequency range.</description>

Abstract: We classify $f(R)$ theories using a mathematical analogy between slow-roll inflation and the renormalization-group flow. We derive the power spectra and spectral indices class by class and compare them with the latest data. The framework used for the classification allows us to determine the general structure of the $f(R)$ functions that belong to each class. Our main result is that only two classes survive. Moreover, we show that the Starobinsky model is the only polynomial $f(R)$ that can realize slow-roll inflation. In fact, all other polynomials belong to a special class that can only realize constant-roll inflation, at least far enough in the past. We point out some of the issues involved in considering a smooth transition between constant-roll and slow-roll inflation in this class of models. Finally, we derive the map that transforms the results from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame.</description>

Abstract: Holography and entropy bounds suggest that the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs of gravitational effective theories are related to one another as a form of UV/IR mixing. Motivated by this, we derive a bound on the allowed scalar field range in theories with cosmic horizons. We show how this bound challenges several inflationary scenarios, such as $\alpha$-attractors and modular-invariant inflation. Besides, we find a relation between the number of extra spatial dimensions and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity with DESI 2024 LRG and QSO samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the large-scale clustering of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Quasar (QSO) sample from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In particular, we constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) parameter $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ via the large-scale scale-dependent bias in the power spectrum using $1,631,716$ LRGs ($0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1$) and $1,189,129$ QSOs ($0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.1$). This new measurement takes advantage of the enormous statistical power at large scales of DESI DR1 data, surpassing the latest data release (DR16) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). For the first time in this kind of analysis, we use a blinding procedure to mitigate the risk of confirmation bias in our results. We improve the model of the radial integral constraint proposing an innovative correction of the window function. We also carefully test the mitigation of the dependence of the target selection on the photometry qualities by incorporating an angular integral constraint contribution to the window function, and validate our methodology with the blinded data. Finally, combining the two samples, we measure $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = {-3.6}_{-9.1}^{+9.0}$ at $68\%$ confidence, where we assume the universality relation for the LRG sample and a recent merger model for the QSO sample about the response of bias to primordial non-Gaussianity. Adopting the universality relation for the PNG bias in the QSO analysis leads to $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = 3.5_{-7.4}^{+10.7}$ at $68\%$ confidence. This measurement is the most precise determination of primordial non-Gaussianity using large-scale structure to date, surpassing the latest result from eBOSS by a factor of $2.3$.</description>

      <title>Addendum: Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Inhomogeneous Perturbations of the Inflaton on the Cosmological Primordial Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of inhomogeneous inflaton perturbations on primordial magnetic fields within the framework of generalized inflationary magnetogenesis models. Extending the Ratra model to general spacetime backgrounds, we analyze the constraint structure of the electromagnetic field and demonstrate that the standard Coulomb gauge must be generalized to accommodate spatial inhomogeneities. Instead of the vector potential, we solve the conjugate momentum with the modified initial conditions introduced by the coupling function, which become dominant during the late stages of inflation. These change the conditions under which scale-invariant electromagnetic spectra are achieved. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating convolutions between vector potentials and inflaton perturbations by employing separate large- and small-scale approximations. The resulting influence to the electric and magnetic power spectra are quantified using $\Delta_E$ and $\Delta_B$, revealing a scale-dependent influence of inhomogeneities. We also find that the spectrum index evolution is sensitive to the sign of $V_{\phi}$, with distinctive behaviors for electric and magnetic fields under different scale-invariance conditions. Notably, for nearly scale-invariant magnetic fields, the perturbative effects shift the spectral index towards the red and migrate toward smaller scales as inflation progresses, offering a potential observational probe to differentiate between large-field and small-field inflation scenarios.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Measuring intrinsic galaxy alignments in deep wide fields as a function of colour, luminosity, stellar mass and redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the measurements and constraints of intrinsic alignments (IA) in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) deep wide fields, which include the W1 and W3 fields from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) and the G09 field from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Our analyses cover 51deg$^{2}$, in the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) range $0.1 &lt; z_{\mathrm{b}} &lt; 1$ and a magnitude limit $i_{\mathrm{AB}}&lt;22$. The precise photo-$z$s and the luminosity coverage of PAUS enable robust IA measurements, which are key for setting informative priors for upcoming stage-IV surveys. For red galaxies, we detect an increase in IA amplitude with both luminosity and stellar mass, extending previous results towards fainter and less massive regimes. As a function of redshift, we observe strong IA signals at intermediate ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.55$) and high ($z_{\mathrm{b}}\sim0.75$) redshift bins. However, we find no significant trend of IA evolution with redshift after accounting for the varying luminosities across redshift bins, consistent with the literature. For blue galaxies, no significant IA signal is detected, with $A_{1}=0.68_{-0.51}^{+0.53}$ when splitting only by galaxy colour, yielding some of the tightest constraints to date for the blue population and constraining a regime of very faint and low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Are single-field models of inflation and PBH production ruled out by ACT observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) imposes stronger constraints on primordial black hole (PBH) formation in single-field inflation models than the Planck data. In particular, the updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation measurements favour a $higher$ scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its $positive$ running $\alpha_s$. Even in the absence of PBH production, the updated constraints together place many single-field models under tension with the CMB data. To explore this tension, we study PBH formation in an $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We investigate an impact of bending of the inflaton potential plateau toward reconciling the model with the new bounds for CMB observables. We find that attempts to increase $n_s$ by upward bending lead to negative values of $\alpha_s$ that are disfavoured by the new bounds. A possible model-building approach to resolve the tension is proposed.</description>

      <title>Requirements on bandpass resolution and measurement precision for LiteBIRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of an imperfect knowledge of the instrument bandpasses on the estimate of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the context of the next-generation LiteBIRD satellite. We develop a pipeline to include bandpass integration in both the time-ordered data (TOD) and the map-making processing steps. We introduce the systematic effect by having a mismatch between the ``real'', high resolution bandpass $\tau$, entering the TOD, and the estimated one $\tau_s$, used in the map-making. We focus on two aspects: the effect of degrading the $\tau_s$ resolution, and the addition of a Gaussian error $\sigma$ to $\tau_s$. To reduce the computational load of the analysis, the two effects are explored separately, for three representative LiteBIRD channels (40 GHz, 140 GHz and 402 GHz) and for three bandpass shapes. Computing the amount of bias on $r$, $\Delta r$, caused by these effects on a single channel, we find that a resolution $\lesssim 1.5$ GHz and $\sigma \lesssim 0.0089$ do not exceed the LiteBIRD budget allocation per systematic effect, $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. We then check that propagating separately the uncertainties due to a resolution of 1 GHz and a measurement error with $\sigma = 0.0089$ in all LiteBIRD frequency channels, for the most pessimistic bandpass shape of the three considered, still produces a $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. This is done both with the simple deprojection approach and with a blind component separation technique, the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC). Due to the effectiveness of NILC in cleaning the systematic residuals, we have tested that the requirement on $\sigma$ can be relaxed to $\sigma \lesssim 0.05$. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Probing the Cosmic Neutrino Background and New Physics with TeV-Scale Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use recent evidence of TeV neutrino events from the most significant astrophysical sources detected by IceCube -- NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, PKS 1424+240 -- to constrain the local and global overdensity of relic neutrinos and to explore potential new neutrino self-interactions. Assuming a relic neutrino overdensity, such high-energy neutrinos have travelled considerable distances through a sea of relic neutrinos and could have undergone scattering, altering their observed flux on Earth. Considering only Standard Model interactions, we constrain the relic overdensity to $\eta \leq 2 \times 10^{14}$ at the 90$\%$ confidence level, assuming the sum of neutrino masses saturates the cosmological bound, $\sum_i m_i = 0.13$ eV. We demonstrate that this limit improves for larger neutrino masses and study how it depends on the scale of the overdensity region. Considering new interactions between TeV-scale neutrinos and relic neutrinos, mediated by a light boson, we probe couplings of approximately $g \sim 10^{-2}$ with current data for a boson mass around the MeV scale. We demonstrate that this limit improves with larger neutrino masses and the scale of the overdensity region.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes (as Dark Matter) from the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the production of primordial black holes (PBHs), as well as their mass and initial spin, due to the phase transitions corresponding to radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) and featuring a large supercooling. The latter property allows us to use a model-independent approach. In this context, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the false vacuum grows exponentially with time to a high degree of accuracy, justifying a time dependence commonly assumed in the literature. Our study provides ready-to-use results for determining the abundance, mass and initial spin of PBHs generated in a generic RSB model with large supercooling. We find that PBHs are generically produced in a broad region of the model-independent parameter space. As an application, we identify the subregion that may explain recently reported microlensing anomalies. Additionally, we show that a simple Standard-Model extension, with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ featuring RSB, may explain an anomaly of this sort in a region of its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic Universe that can be applied to the study of early Universe physics during the epoch of radiation domination. The conservation laws for a conducting perfect fluid with relativistic bulk velocities in an expanding background are presented, extending previous results that apply in the limit of subrelativistic bulk motion. Furthermore, it is shown that the subrelativistic limit presents new corrections that have not been considered in previous work. We discuss the conformal invariance of the MHD equations for a radiation-dominated fluid and different types of scaling of the fluid variables that are relevant for other equations of state when the bulk velocity is subrelativistic. In particular, we review the super-comoving coordinates that scale the time coordinate with the Universe expansion, and present a particular choice that allows the equations to become conformally flat for any choice of the equation of state. Imperfect relativistic fluids are briefly described but their detailed study is not included in this work. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfv\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves in the early Universe plasma. The Boris correction for relativistic Alfv\'en speeds is presented and adapted for early Universe applications. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented at the minicourse ``Simulations of Early Universe Magnetohydrodynamics'' lectured by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL, as part of the six-week program ``Generation, evolution, and observations of cosmological magnetic fields'' at the Bernoulli Center in May 2024.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic power-law inflation for the S\'aez-Ballester theory non-minimally coupled to a vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to examine whether the S\'aez-Ballester theory admits stable and attractive Bianchi type I inflationary solutions in the presence of a non-minimal coupling between scalar and vector fields such as $f^2(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. As a result, such a solution will be shown to exist within this theory for a suitable setup of fields. Interestingly, the considered S\'aez-Ballester theory can be shown to be equivalent to the standard scalar-vector theory via a suitable field redefinition. This means that the obtained solution can be reduced to that derived in an original anisotropic inflation model proposed by Kanno, Soda, and Watanabe. Consequently, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio of this solution turns out to be higher than the latest observational value of the Planck satellite (Planck 2018) due to the fact that $c_s$, the corresponding speed of sound of scalar perturbations of the S\'aez-Ballester theory, turns out to be one. This result indicates an important hint that the speed of sound, $c_s$, could play an important role in making the corresponding non-canonical anisotropic inflation cosmologically viable in the light of the Planck 2018 data. To be more specific, we will point out that any modifications of the S\'aez-Ballester theory having $c_s \sim 0.1$ will have a great potential to be highly consistent with the Planck 2018 data. For heuristic reasons, a simple modified version of the S\'aez-Ballester theory will be proposed as a specific demonstration. As a result, we will show that this modified model admits an anisotropic power-law inflationary solution as expected.</description>

      <title>Gas outflows in two recently quenched galaxies at z = 4 and 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $&lt;12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $&gt;10$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernova feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is likely not the primary factor behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

Abstract: Measurements of the ionisation state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can probe the sources of the extragalactic ionising background. We provide new measurements of the ionising emissivity of galaxies using measurements of the ionising background and ionising photon mean free path from high-redshift quasar spectra at $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$. Unlike most prior works, we account for radiative-transfer effects and possible neutral islands from the tail of reionisation at $z &gt; 5$. We combine our results with measurements of the UV luminosity function to constrain the average escaping ionising efficiency of galaxies, $\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}$. Assuming galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$ emit ionising photons, we find $\log (\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}/{\rm erg^{-1}Hz}) = 24.47_{-0.17}^{+0.09}$ and $24.75_{-0.28}^{+0.15}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $24.48$ and $24.31$ at $z = 2.5$ and $4$, respectively. We also estimate the population-averaged $f_{\rm esc}$ using measurements of intrinsic ionising efficiency from JWST. We find $\langle f_{\rm esc} \rangle = 0.126_{-0.041}^{+0.034}$ and $0.224_{-0.108}^{+0.098}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{\rm esc}&lt; 0.138$ and $0.096$ at $z=2.5$ and $4$, respectively, for $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$. Our findings are consistent with prior measurements of $f_{\rm esc} \lesssim 10\%$ at $z \leq 4$, but indicate a factor of several increase between $z = 4$ and $6$. The steepness of this evolution is sensitive to the highly uncertain mean free path and ionising background intensity at $z&gt;5$. Lastly, we find $1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.39}$ photons per H atom are emitted into the IGM between $z=6$ and $=5.3$. This is $\approx 4\times$ more than needed to complete the last $20\%$ of reionisation absent recombinations, suggesting that reionisation's end was likely absorption-dominated.</description>

      <title>Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539</link>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state under a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states. In contrast to the usual Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coherence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We also examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem.</description>
