      <title>Comment on "Repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks Leaves Heritable Impairment to Genome Function"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bantele and colleagues recently reported that repair of a single CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) in the c-MYC topologically associated domain leads to a persistent depletion of chromatin interactions and long-term transcriptional attenuation across multiple generations of human cells. They interpret this observation as evidence for a previously unrecognized principle--"chromatin fatigue"--in which DSB repair generates a stable architectural defect that acts as a heritable impairment to genome function. Such an idea, if correct, would carry profound implications for genome biology, epigenetic inheritance, cancer evolution, aging, and the safety of therapeutic genome editing. However, our detailed reassessment of the experimental design, underlying assumptions, and data interpretation reveals that the evidence provided is inadequate to support these sweeping conclusions. Instead, the observed outcomes are more plausibly explained by a combination of Cas9 persistence, off-target DNA damage, repair-factor retention, MYC enhancer plasticity, and the well-documented genomic instability of HeLa cells. The study does not demonstrate mechanistic causality, does not exclude simpler explanations, and does not provide data consistent with true chromatin memory or heritable architectural change. Moreover, its statistical inferences are based on noisy measurements that fall within expected variability of unstable oncogenic loci. Here, we present a comprehensive critical analysis showing that the proposed model of chromatin fatigue is unsupported by the available evidence. We offer a corrected interpretation in which the chromatin landscape experiences a temporary, repair-associated perturbation that resolves without leaving enduring or heritable impairment.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Modelling in Cellular Biology - Are we flexible yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular Agent-Based Models are commonly employed to describe a variety biological systems. Over the course of the past years, many modeling tools have emerged which solve particular research questions. In this short opinion piece, we argue that existing frameworks lack flexibility compared to the inherent underlying complexity that they should be able to represent. We extract overarching principles of widely used software solutions across multiple domains and compare these with existing Agent-Based Models (ABMs). We come to the conclusion that existing ABMs lack in flexibility which hinders overall progress of the field.</description>
