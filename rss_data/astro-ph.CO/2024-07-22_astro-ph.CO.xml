      <title>Living at the Edge: A Critical Look at the Cosmological Neutrino Mass Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological neutrino mass bounds are becoming increasingly stringent. The latest limit within $\Lambda$CDM from Planck 2018+ACT lensing+DESI is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% CL, very close to the minimum possible sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.06\,{\rm eV}$), hinting at vanishing or even ''negative'' cosmological neutrino masses. In this context, it is urgent to carefully evaluate the origin of these cosmological constraints. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of these results in three ways: i) we check the role of potential anomalies in Planck CMB and DESI BAO data; ii) we compare the results for frequentist and Bayesian techniques, as very close to physical boundaries subtleties in the derivation and interpretation of constraints can arise; iii) we investigate how deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, potentially alleviating these anomalies, can alter the constraints. From a profile likelihood analysis, we derive constraints in agreement at the $\sim 10\%$ level with Bayesian posteriors. We find that the weak preference for negative neutrino masses is mostly present for Planck 18 data, affected by the well-known `lensing anomaly'. It disappears when the new Planck 2020 HiLLiPoP is used, leading to significantly weaker constraints. Additionally, the pull towards negative masses in DESI data stems from the $z=0.7$ bin, which is in $\sim 3\sigma$ tension with Planck expectations. Without these outliers, and in combination with HiLLiPoP, the bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% CL. The recent preference for dynamical dark energy alleviates this tension and further weakens the bound. As we are at the dawn of a neutrino mass discovery from cosmology, it will be very exciting to see if this trend is confirmed by future data.</description>

      <title>Accurately Estimating Redshifts from CSST Slitless Spectroscopic Survey using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: China Space Station Telescope (CSST) has the capability to conduct slitless spectroscopic survey simultaneously with photometric survey. The spectroscopic survey will measure slitless spectra, potentially providing more accurate estimations of galaxy properties, particularly redshift, compared to broadband photometry. However, due to low-resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of slitless spectra, measurement of these properties is significantly challenging. In this study, we employ a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to assess the accuracy of redshift estimations from slitless spectra anticipated to be observed by CSST. The slitless spectra are simulated based on real data from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI-EDR) and the 16th data release of the Baryon Oscillaton Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS-DR16), combining the 9th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey (DESI LS DR9). The BNN provides redshifts estimates along with corresponding uncertainties, achieving an accuracy of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} = 0.00063$, outlier percentage $\eta=0.92\%$ and weighted mean uncertainty $\bar{E} = 0.00228$. These results successfully meet the requirement for cosmological studies using slitless spectra from CSST.</description>

      <title>On the tomographic cluster clustering as a cosmological probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of galaxy clusters is a valuable probe for inferring fundamental cosmological parameters. We measured the clustering properties of dark matter haloes from the \textsc{Pinocchio} simulations, in the redshift range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0$ and with virial masses $M_\mathrm{vir} &gt; 10^{14} M_\odot \, h^{-1}$, which reproduce the expected mass selection of galaxy cluster samples. The past-light cones we analysed have an angular size of 60 degrees, which approximately corresponds to a quarter of the sky. We adopted a linear power spectrum model, accounting for nonlinear corrections at the baryon acoustic oscillations scale, to perform a comparative study between 3D and 2D tomographic clustering. For this purpose, we modelled the multipoles of the 3D two-point correlation function, $\xi(r)$, the angular correlation function, $w(\theta)$, and the angular power spectrum, $C_\ell$. We considered observational effects such as redshift-space distortions, produced by the peculiar velocities of tracers, and redshift errors. We found that photometric redshift errors have a more severe consequence on the 3D than on the 2D clustering, as they affect only the radial separation between haloes and not the angular one, with a relevant impact on the 3D multipoles. Using a Bayesian analysis, we explored the posterior distributions of the considered probes with different tomographic strategies, in the $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ plane, focusing on the summary parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$. Our results show that in the presence of large photometric errors the 2D clustering can provide competitive cosmological constraints with respect to the full 3D clustering statistics, and can be successfully applied to analyse the galaxy cluster catalogues from the ongoing and forthcoming Stage-III and Stage-IV photometric redshift surveys.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from an oscillating axion-like field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for isotropic cosmic birefringence with an axion-like field that rapidly oscillates during the recombination epoch. In conventional models, the field oscillation during the recombination epoch leads to a cancellation of the birefringence effect and significantly suppresses the EB spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. By introducing an asymmetric potential to the axion, this cancellation becomes incomplete, and a substantial EB spectrum can be produced. This mechanism also results in a washout of the EE spectrum, which can be probed in future CMB observations. Our findings suggest the possibility that an axion-like field responsible for isotropic cosmic birefringence can also account for a significant fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-driven likelihood-free parameter inference for 21-cm forest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure absorption lines of neutral hydrogen in spectra of high-redshift radio sources, known collectively as the 21-cm forest, have been demonstrated as a sensitive probe to the small-scale structures governed by the dark matter (DM) properties, as well as the thermal history of the intergalactic medium regulated by the first galaxies during the epoch of reionization. By statistically analyzing these spectral features, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can effectively break the parameter degeneracies and constrain the properties of both DM and the first galaxies. However, conventional parameter inference methods face challenges due to computationally expensive simulations for 21-cm forest and the non-Gaussian signal characteristics. To address these issues, we introduce generative normalizing flows for data augmentation and inference normalizing flows for parameters estimation. This approach efficiently estimates parameters from minimally simulated datasets with non-Gaussian signals. Using simulated data from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we demonstrate the ability of the deep learning-driven likelihood-free approach to generate accurate posterior distributions, providing a robust and efficient tool for probing DM and the cosmic heating history using the 1D power spectrum of 21-cm forest in the era of SKA. This methodology is adaptable for scientific analyses with other unevenly distributed data.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array sensitivity to anisotropies in the gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations have recently gathered substantial evidence for the existence of a gravitational wave background in the nHz frequency band. Searching for anisotropies in this signal is key to determining its origin, and in particular to distinguish possible astrophysical from cosmological sources. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of current and future pulsar timing arrays to such anisotropies using the full covariance matrix of pulsar timing delays. While current day pulsar timing arrays can only set mildly informative constraints on the dipole and quadrupole, we show that percent level accuracy for several low multipoles can be achieved in the near future. Moreover, we demonstrate that anisotropies in the gravitational wave background and the Hellings-Downs angular correlation, indicating the presence of GWs, are approximately uncorrelated, and can hence be reconstructed independently. These results can be reproduced with \href{https://github.com/Mauropieroni/fastPTA}{\texttt{fastPTA}}, a publicly available Python code to forecast the constraining power of PTA configurations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of composite dark matter in the Cosmic Microwave Background spectral distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spectral distortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) created by an exotic process that extracts or injects photons of a particular frequency into the CMB. Such signatures are a natural prediction of a class of composite dark matter models characterized by electrically neutral states but with non-zero higher order electromagnetic moments. We consider a simplified model where dark matter exists as a two state system separated by a fixed transition frequency, which can range from radio waves to gamma rays. The electromagnetic transitions between the two states due to CMB photons give rise to thermal distortions, namely, the $\mu$-type distortion in the redshift range $10^5\lesssim z \lesssim 2\times 10^6$ and the $y$-type distortion as well as non-thermal distortions at redshifts $z \lesssim 10^5$. The nature of spectral distortions depends sensitively on the dark matter transition frequency and the strength of couplings of dark matter with visible sector particles as well as its self-interactions, thus opening a new window to probe the nature of dark matter. Non-thermal distortions have unique spectral shapes making them distinguishable from the standard $\mu$ and $y$-type distortions and potentially detectable in the next-generation experiments such as Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE). We also find that the spectral distortion limits from the COsmic Background Explorer/Far-Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) already give a constraint on the electromagnetic coupling of dark matter which is three orders of magnitude stronger compared to the current direct detection limits for $\sim$ MeV mass dark matter with transition energy in $\sim 1$-$10$ eV range.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of primordial gravitational atoms (PGAs), which may exist in the current and past universe due to spinning primordial black holes (PBHs) and very light bosonic fields. In a monochromatic mass scenario with a sizable dimensionless spin, which may arise in a short matter dominated (MD) era, we analyze the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal. Its spectrum is approximately characterized by a rising $\propto f^3$ followed by a falling $\propto f^{-1}$ where $f$ is the frequency. Then, we investigate the constraints and prospects of such a SGWB, and find that PGAs with a core mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim {\cal O}(10)~M_{\odot}$ and a cloud of light scalar with mass $\mu \sim {\cal O} (10^{-13})$ eV could yield constraints even stronger than those from bare PBHs. Future detectors such as LISA, Taiji and TianQin are able to explore PGAs over a narrow and elongated strap in the $(\mu,M_{\rm BH})$ plane, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude for the maximum spin, $10^{-8}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 10^4~M_{\odot}$, $10^{-16}~{\rm eV}\lesssim \mu\lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm eV$. If the PGA is dressed with a vector cloud, the SGWB signal has a much better opportunity to be probed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons coupling to $L_\mu-L_\tau$ lepton number difference are a highly studied light dark matter candidate, with potential to be discovered through their impact on terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. We re-examine this in the light of claimed tensions between the NO$\nu$A and T2K long baseline experiments, also taking into account data from the MINOS experiment. We obtain leading limits on the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge coupling $g'$ versus dark photon mass $m_{A'}$, and find no statistically significant alleviation of the tension from inclusion of the new physics effect.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Massive Black Hole Merger Host Galaxies from Cosmological Simulations II: Unique Stellar Kinematics in Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational wave experiments such as LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently in Bardati et al. (2024, Paper I), we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral datacubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (&gt;10^8.2 Msun) and high mass ratios (&gt;0.5), the accuracies reach &gt;85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves</description>

      <title>A "Rosetta Stone" for Studies of Spatial Variation in Astrophysical Data: Power Spectra, Semivariograms, and Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the turbulent interstellar medium to the cosmic web, astronomers in many different fields have needed to make sense of spatial data describing our Universe, spanning centimetre to Gigaparsec scales. Through different historical choices for mathematical conventions, many different subfields of spatial data analysis have evolved their own language for analysing structures and quantifying correlation in spatial data. Because of this history, terminology from a myriad of different fields is used, often to describe two data products that are mathematically identical. In this Note, we define and describe the differences and similarities between the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, the covariance function, the semivariogram, and the structure functions, in an effort to unify the languages used to study spatial correlation. We also highlight under which conditions these data products are useful and describe how the results found using one method can be translated to those found using another, allowing for easier comparison between different subfields' native methods. We hope for this document to be a ``Rosetta Stone" for translating between different statistical approaches, allowing results to be shared between researchers from different backgrounds, facilitating more cross-disciplinary approaches to data analysis.</description>

      <title>New simple and accurate approximations for quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive new simple approximations for quintessence in a spatially homogeneous, isotropic and flat spacetime. The approximations are typically an order of magnitude more accurate than anything available in the literature, which from an observational perspective makes numerical calculations superfluous. For example, our tracking quintessence approximation, with one less parameter than CPL and a comparably simple expression, yields a $0.1\%$ maximum relative error of $H(z)/H_0$ for the inverse power law scalar field potential. We situate the new results in a broader dark energy context, where the present parametrized deviations from $\Lambda$CDM offer simple alternatives to the CPL parametrization, useful for observations at increasingly large redshifts.</description>

      <title>Hyenas: X-ray Bubbles and Cavities in the Intra-Group Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Simba feedback model on the structure of the Intra-Group Medium (IGrM) in the new Hyenas suite of cutting-edge cosmological zoom-in simulations. Using 34 high-resolution zooms of halos spanning from $10^{13}-10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0.286$, we follow halos for 700 Myr, over several major active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet feedback events. We use the MOXHA package to generate mock Chandra X-ray observations, as well as predictive mocks for the upcoming LEM mission, identifying many feedback-generated features such as cavities, shock-fronts, and hot-spots, closely mimicking real observations. Our sample comprises $105$ snapshots with identified cavities, $50$ with single bubbles and $55$ with two, and spans three orders of magnitude in observed cavity enthalpies, from $10^{41}-10^{44}$ erg/s. Comparing semi-major axis length, midpoint radius, and eccentricity to a matched sample of observations, we find good agreement in cavity dimensions with real catalogues. We estimate cavity power from our mock maps following observational procedures, showing that this is typically more than enough to offset halo cooling, particularly in low-mass halos, where we match the observed excess in energy relative to cooling. Bubble enthalpy as measured with the usual midpoint pressure typically exceeds the energy released by the most recent jet event, hinting that the mechanical work is done predominantly at a lower pressure against the IGrM. We demonstrate for the first time that X-ray cavities are observable in a modern large-scale simulation suite and discuss the use of realistic cavity mock observations as new halo-scale constraints on feedback models in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Clustering Analysis with SimBIG and the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>

Abstract: The non-Gaussisan spatial distribution of galaxies traces the large-scale structure of the Universe and therefore constitutes a prime observable to constrain cosmological parameters. We conduct Bayesian inference of the $\Lambda$CDM parameters $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sigma_8$ from the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample by combining the wavelet scattering transform (WST) with a simulation-based inference approach enabled by the ${\rm S{\scriptsize IM}BIG}$ forward model. We design a set of reduced WST statistics that leverage symmetries of redshift-space data. Posterior distributions are estimated with a conditional normalizing flow trained on 20,000 simulated ${\rm S{\scriptsize IM}BIG}$ galaxy catalogs with survey realism. We assess the accuracy of the posterior estimates using simulation-based calibration and quantify generalization and robustness to the change of forward model using a suite of 2,000 test simulations. When probing scales down to $k_{\rm max}=0.5~h/\text{Mpc}$, we are able to derive accurate posterior estimates that are robust to the change of forward model for all parameters, except $\sigma_8$. We mitigate the robustness issues with $\sigma_8$ by removing the WST coefficients that probe scales smaller than $k \sim 0.3~h/\text{Mpc}$. Applied to the BOSS CMASS sample, our WST analysis yields seemingly improved constraints obtained from a standard PT-based power spectrum analysis with $k_{\rm max}=0.25~h/\text{Mpc}$ for all parameters except $h$. However, we still raise concerns on these results. The observational predictions significantly vary across different normalizing flow architectures, which we interpret as a form of model misspecification. This highlights a key challenge for forward modeling approaches when using summary statistics that are sensitive to detailed model-specific or observational imprints on galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>Accurate field-level weak lensing inference for precision cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{Miko}$, a catalog-to-cosmology pipeline for general flat-sky field-level inference, which provides access to cosmological information beyond the two-point statistics. In the context of weak lensing, we identify several new field-level analysis systematics (such as aliasing, Fourier mode-coupling, and density-induced shape noise), quantify their impact on cosmological constraints, and correct the biases to a percent level. Next, we find that model misspecification can lead to both absolute bias and incorrect uncertainty quantification for the inferred cosmological parameters in realistic simulations. The Gaussian map prior infers unbiased cosmological parameters, regardless of the true data distribution, but it yields overconfident uncertainties. The log-normal map prior quantifies the uncertainties accurately, although it requires careful calibration of the shift parameters for unbiased cosmological parameters. We demonstrate systematics control down to the $2\%$ level for both models, making them suitable for ongoing weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>A warm dark matter cosmogony may yield more low-mass galaxy detections in 21-cm surveys than a cold dark matter one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21-cm spectral line widths, $w_{50}$, of galaxies are an approximate tracer of their dynamical masses, such that the dark matter halo mass function is imprinted in the number density of galaxies as a function of $w_{50}$. Correcting observed number counts for survey incompleteness at the level of accuracy needed to place competitive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) cosmological models is very challenging, but forward-modelling the results of cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations into observational data space is more straightforward. We take this approach to make predictions for an ALFALFA-like survey from simulations using the EAGLE galaxy formation model in both cold (CDM) and WDM cosmogonies. We find that for WDM cosmogonies more galaxies are detected at the low-$w_{50}$ end of the 21-cm velocity width function than in the CDM cosmogony, contrary to what might na\"ively be expected from the suppression of power on small scales in such models. This is because low-mass galaxies form later and retain more gas in WDM cosmogonies (with EAGLE). While some shortcomings in the treatment of cold gas in the EAGLE model preclude placing definitive constraints on WDM scenarios, our analysis illustrates that near-future simulations with more accurate modelling of cold gas will likely make strong constraints possible, especially in conjunction with new 21-cm surveys such as WALLABY.</description>

Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) has emerged as a promising tool for probing the 3D large-scale structure through the aggregate emission of spectral lines. The presence of interloper lines poses a crucial challenge in extracting the signal from the target line in LIM. In this work, we introduce a novel method for LIM analysis that simultaneously extracts line signals from multiple spectral lines, utilizing the covariance of native LIM data elements defined in the spectral--angular space. We leverage correlated information from different lines to perform joint inference on all lines simultaneously, employing a Bayesian analysis framework. We present the formalism, demonstrate our technique with a mock survey setup resembling the SPHEREx deep field observation, and consider four spectral lines within the SPHEREx spectral coverage in the near infrared: H$\alpha$, $[$\ion{O}{3}$]$, H$\beta$, and $[$\ion{O}{2}$]$. We demonstrate that our method can extract the power spectrum of all four lines at the $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ level at $z&lt;2$. For the brightest line, H$\alpha$, the $10\sigma$ sensitivity can be achieved out to $z\sim3$. Our technique offers a flexible framework for LIM analysis, enabling simultaneous inference of signals from multiple line emissions while accommodating diverse modeling constraints and parameterizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model and its generalized form, namely the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) model, which introduces a free parameter \unboldmath {\( \Delta \)} that can discriminate between the \unboldmath{$\mathrm{\Lambda}$}CDM model and the PEDE model. Fitting the emergent dark energy (EDE) models with the observational datasets including the cosmology-independent gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the observational Hubble data (OHD) at intermediate redshift, we find a large value of $H_0$ which is close to the results of local measurement of $H_0$ from the SH0ES Collaboration in both EDE models. These results suggest that PEDE and GEDE models can %serve as an important supplement and be possible alternative to the standard cosmological model, pending further theoretical explorations and observational verifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Morphological Measurements of Cosmic Web with Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density fields constructed by traditional mass assignment methods are susceptible to irritating discreteness, which hinders morphological measurements of cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) through Minkowski functionals (MFs). For alleviating this issue, fixed-kernel smoothing methods are commonly used in literatures, at the expense of losing substantial structural information. In this work, we propose to measure MFs with Delaunay tessellation field estimation (DTFE) technique, with the goal to maximize extractions of morphological information from sparse tracers. We perform our analyses starting from matter fields and progressively extending to halo fields. At matter field level, we elucidate how discreteness affects the morphological measurements of LSS. Then, by comparing with traditional Gaussian smoothing scheme, we preliminarily showcase the advantages of DTFE for enhancing measurements of MFs from sparse tracers. At halo field level, we first numerically investigate various systematic effects on MFs of DTFE fields, which are induced by finite voxel sizes, halo number densities, halo weightings, and redshift space distortions (RSDs), respectively. Then, we explore the statistical power of MFs measured with DTFE for extracting cosmological information encoded in RSDs. We find that MFs measured with DTFE exhibit improvements by $\sim$ $2$ orders of magnitude in discriminative power for RSD effects and by a factor of $\sim$ $3$-$5$ in constraining power on structure growth rate over the MFs measured with Gaussian smoothing. These findings demonstrate the remarkable enhancements in statistical power of MFs achieved by DTFE, showing enormous application potentials of our method in extracting various key cosmological information from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Thermal curvature perturbations in thermal inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the power spectrum of super-horizon curvature perturbations generated during a late period of thermal inflation, taking into account fluctuation-dissipation effects resulting from the scalar flaton field's interactions with the ambient radiation bath. We find that, at the onset of thermal inflation, the flaton field may reach an equilibrium with the radiation bath even for relatively small coupling constants, maintaining a spectrum of thermal fluctuations until the critical temperature $T_c$, below which thermal effects stop holding the field at the false potential minimum. This enhances the field variance compared to purely quantum fluctuations, therefore increasing the average energy density during thermal inflation and damping the induced curvature perturbations. In particular, we find that this inhibits the later formation of primordial black holes, at least on scales that leave the horizon for $T&gt;T_c$. The larger thermal field variance also reduces the duration of a period of fast-roll inflation below $T_c$, as the field rolls to the true potential minimum, which should also affect the generation of (large) curvature perturbations on even smaller scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IceCube collaboration has previously reported an evidence for neutrino signal from a Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. This may suggest that all Seyfert galaxies emit neutrinos. To test this hypothesis, we identify the best candidate neutrino sources among nearby Seyfert galaxies, based on their hard X-ray properties. Only two other sources, NGC 4151 and NGC 3079 are expected to be detectable in 10 years of IceCube data. We find an evidence (~3 sigma)} for neutrino signal from both sources in publicly available ten-year IceCube dataset. {Though neither source alone is above the threshold for discovery,} the chance coincidence probability to find the observed neutrino count excesses in the directions of the two out of two expected sources, in addition to the previously reported brightest source, is p&lt;2.6e-7. This corresponds to a correlation between Seyfert galaxies and neutrino emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectroscopic study of black hole quasinormal modes in gravitational-wave ringdown observations is hindered by our ignorance of which modes should dominate astrophysical signals for different binary configurations, limiting tests of general relativity and astrophysics. In this work, we present a description of the quasinormal modes that are excited in the ringdowns of comparable mass, quasi-circular precessing binary black hole coalescences -- a key region of parameter space that has yet to be fully explored within the framework of black hole spectroscopy. We suggest that the remnant perturbation for precessing and non-precessing systems is approximately the same up to a rotation, which implies that the relative amplitudes of the quasinormal modes in both systems are also related by a rotation. We present evidence for this by analyzing an extensive catalog of numerical relativity simulations. Additional structure in the amplitudes is connected to the system's kick velocity and other asymmetries in the orbital dynamics. We find that the ringdowns of precessing systems need not be dominated by the ${(\ell,m)=(2,\pm 2)}$ quasinormal modes, and that instead the $(2,\pm 1)$~or~$(2,0)$ quasinormal modes can dominate. Our results are consistent with a ringdown analysis of the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave signal GW190521, and may also help in understanding phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model systematics.</description>

Abstract: We show analytically that there exist compact stellar objects akin to neutron stars whose radius is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius defined by Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass. The radius of the compact object is defined by the radius where the energy density and the pressure of ordinary matter vanish, while clouds of scalar(s) can extend beyond this radius -- a situation that is often encountered in modified gravity theories, like $F(R)$ gravity and the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The clouds of scalar mode(s) give additional contributions to the ADM mass and as a result, the corresponding Schwarzschild radius given by the ADM mass can be larger than that of the compact object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop generalized no-scale supergravity models of inflation, and then study the corresponding cosmological predictions as well as the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). With a new parameter $0&lt;a\leq 1$, the generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $a\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of PBHs with various mass scales, which could account for a significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>

      <title>Precision cosmology with exact inhomogeneous solutions of General Relativity: the Szekeres models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing an homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for this purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be very smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Constraints from SuperCDMS HVeV Detectors Operated Underground with an Anticoincidence Event Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents constraints on dark-matter-electron interactions obtained from the first underground data-taking campaign with multiple SuperCDMS HVeV detectors operated in the same housing. An exposure of 7.63 g-days is used to set upper limits on the dark-matter-electron scattering cross section for dark matter masses between 0.5 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$, as well as upper limits on dark photon kinetic mixing and axion-like particle axioelectric coupling for masses between 1.2 and 23.3 eV/$c^2$. Compared to an earlier HVeV search, sensitivity was improved as a result of an increased overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent, an anticoincidence event selection, and better pile-up rejection. In the case of dark-matter-electron scattering via a heavy mediator, an improvement by up to a factor of 25 in cross-section sensitivity was achieved.</description>

      <title>Can $f(T)$ models play a bridge between early and late time Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory to accurately predict the primordial abundances of helium and deuterium, as well as the baryon content of the Universe, is considered one of the most significant achievements in modern physics. In the present study, we consider two highly motivated hybrid $f(T)$ models and constrain them using the observations from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis era. In addition, using late-time observations of Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma-Ray-Bursts, the ranges of the model parameters are confined which are in good agreement with early time bounds. Subsequently, the common ranges obtained from the analysis for early and late time are summarized. Further, we verify the intermediating epochs by investigating the profiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the common range. From this study, we find the considered teleparallel models are viable candidates to explain the primordial-intermediating-present epochs.</description>
