      <title>Enhancing Mars Life Explorer (MLE) with True Agnostic Life Detection Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mars Life Explorer (MLE) mission concept offers a critical opportunity to investigate whether extant life exists within the mid-latitude ice deposits of Mars. However, MLE's current science traceability matrix emphasizes habitability assessment and organic chemistry over direct life detection. As crewed missions to Mars may occur as early as 2040, the window for uncontaminated robotic exploration is rapidly closing. A high-confidence determination of Martian life must be achieved before irreversible anthropogenic contamination compromises scientific integrity. This paper evaluates the scientific, technical, and policy limitations of the current MLE architecture and recommends specific instrumentation upgrades and governance measures necessary to enable definitive and agnostic life detection while safeguarding planetary protection.</description>

      <title>Metalens-coupled terahertz NbN hot electron bolometer mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabled by planarized phase engineering, metalenses based on metasurfaces offer compact and scalable solutions for applications such as sensing, imaging, and virtual reality. They are particularly attractive for multi-pixel, large-scale heterodyne focal plane arrays in space observatories, where a flat metalens array on a silicon wafer can replace individual lenses, greatly simplifying system integration and beam alignment. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, a superconducting niobium nitride (NbN) hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixer coupled with a silicon-based metalens operating at terahertz frequencies. The metalens phase profile was derived from a finite-size Gaussian beam source using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, and its focusing behavior was validated through 2D simulation. Experimentally, the metalens-coupled NbN HEB receiver exhibited a noise temperature of 1800 K at 1.63 THz. The power coupling efficiency from free space to the mixer via the metalens was measured to be 25 %. Measured far-field beam profiles are Gaussian-like with sidelobes below -14 dB. These results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating metalenses with HEB mixers for THz detection, offering a scalable path for compact focal plane arrays in space-based THz instrumentation.</description>

      <title>End-to-end reconstruction of ultra-high energy particle observables from radio detection of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio detection of very inclined air showers offers a promising avenue for studying ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and neutrinos. Accurate reconstruction methods are essential for investigating the properties of primary particles. Recently, we developed an analytical least-squares method to reconstruct the electric field using three polarization components. The reconstruction yields no bias, with a 68\% confidence interval of [-0.02, 0.02], and a standard deviation of 0.04. Using this reconstructed electric field, we perform a realistic reconstruction of the the properties of primary particles. We employ a spherical wave model combined with an angular distribution function (ADF) for arrival direction reconstruction, achieving an angular resolution of 0.04$^\circ$. This paper also presents an energy reconstruction in which we account for the effects of geosynchrotron radiation in inclined air showers, we implement an air density correction in the energy reconstruction, resulting in a 10\% resolution in energy estimation. These findings demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of our reconstruction methodology, paving the way for future detection experiments using sparse antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Learning from ASTRI-Horn: products and applications of Variance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the ASTRI MiniArray project (9 dual-mirror air Cherenkov telescopes being installed at the Observatorio del Teide in the Canary Islands), the ASTRI- Horn prototype was previously implemented in Italy (Sicily). It was a crucial test bench for establishing observation strategies, hardware upgrades, and software solutions. Specifically, during the winter 2022/2023 observing campaign, we implemented significant enhancements in using the so-called Variance mode, an auxiliary output of the ASTRI Cherenkov camera able to take images of the night sky background in the near UV/visible band. Variance data are now processed online and on site using a dedicated pipeline and stored in tech files. This data can infer possible telescope mis-pointing, background level, number of identified stars, and point spread function. In this contribution, we briefly present these quantities and their importance together with the algorithms adopted for their calculation. They provide valuable monitoring of telescope health and sky conditions during scientific data collection, enabling the selection of optimal time sequences for Cherenkov data reduction.</description>

      <title>Photometric Mapping of Carbonaceous/Siliceous Dust and Water Ice in the ISM with JWST: Applications to the Dense Sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new photometric mapping method for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the spatial distribution of carbonaceous dust, siliceous dust and water ice by using absorption features arising from the grains in the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Employing NIRCam and MIRI imaging filters, low-resolution spectroscopic data can be obtained to measure the optical depths of the 3.0-$\mu$m water ice -OH feature, the 3.4-$\mu$m aliphatic hydrocarbon -CH feature, and the 10-$\mu$m silicate -SiO feature for large fields of view. This method provides extensive statistical data of the grains across wide fields in the ISM at minimal observing cost. In this study, we present its application on observational data from the literature to validate the measured optical depths and simulations to assess the accuracy of the method under various conditions. We showed that the photometric method can be employed to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of optical depth. We demonstrate that JWST optical depth maps enable the independent exploration of abundance distributions of major grain components across a wide spatial coverage in the ISM.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of centroiding algorithms for an autonomous star tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents numerical results of a computer simulation performed with six centroiding algorithms targeting a star tracker in development at INPE, including readout noise and considering a Gaussian point spread function. Five of the tested algorithms are light-weight centroiding algorithms with low computational costs. These were compared to a shape fitting algorithm based on the lsqnonlin function available in Matlab and GNU Octave. The algorithms studied here are also applicable for astrometry and adaptive optics.</description>

      <title>A unified spin-harmonic framework for correlating pulsar timing, astrometric deflection, and shimmering gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified spin-weighted harmonic framework that delivers analytic, diagonal expressions for the overlap (correlation) functions of three low frequency gravitational wave observables-pulsar timing redshifts, astrometric deflections, and time-dependent image distortions (``shimmering''). Writing each response in spin-$s$ spherical harmonics and rotating to a basis in which the wave tensor has definite helicity, we obtain compact closed-form series for every auto- and cross-correlation, recovering the Hellings-Downs curve as the $s=0$ limit and deriving its astrometric ($s=\pm 1$) and shimmering ($s=\pm 2$) analogues. The formalism naturally extends to non-standard scalar-breathing, longitudinal, and vector polarisation modes, clarifying when higher-spin observables are (and are not) sourced and providing a complete set of harmonic spectra $C_\ell$ ready for parameter estimation pipelines. These results supply the common theoretical language needed to combine upcoming pulsar timing, Gaia-class astrometric, and high resolution imaging data sets, enabling coherent, multi probe searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, tests of general relativity and its alternatives across the nano- to micro-hertz gravitational wave band.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Implications of modern mass-loss rates for massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through stellar winds at various stages of their lives, including on the main sequence, during the red supergiant phase, and as evolved helium-rich Wolf--Rayet stars. In stellar population synthesis, uncertainty in the mass-loss rates in these evolutionary stages limits our understanding of the formation of black holes and merging compact binaries. In the last decade, the theoretical predictions, simulation, and direct observation of wind mass-loss rates in massive stars have improved significantly, typically leading to a reduction in the predicted mass-loss rates of massive stars. In this paper we explore the astrophysical implications of an updated treatment of winds in the COMPAS population synthesis code. There is a large amount of variation in predicted mass-loss rates for massive red supergiants; some of the prescriptions we implement predict that massive red supergiants are able to lose their hydrogen envelopes through winds alone (providing a possible solution to the so-called missing red supergiant problem), while others predict much lower mass-loss rates that would not strip the hydrogen envelope. We discuss the formation of the most massive stellar-mass black holes in the Galaxy, including the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 and the newly discovered Gaia BH3. We find that formation rates of merging binary black holes are sensitive to the mass-loss rate prescriptions, while the formation rates of merging binary neutron stars and neutron-star black hole binaries are more robust to this uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve within a web-like cosmic structure, and their properties are strongly shaped by their surrounding environments. We apply a nonparametric Bayesian two-sample test based on P\'olya tree priors to galaxy data from SDSS DR7 and DESI DR1 BGS to quantify the differences between galaxies in dense and sparse cosmic environments. Compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and parametric Bayesian test, our approach does not require strong assumptions about the underlying distributional form and provides a more sensitive and robust comparison of galaxy evolution across different environments. In particular, galaxies in VoidFinder voids tend to be fainter, less massive, and more star-forming compared to wall galaxies, while such contrasts are diminished under the V^2 REVOLVER pruning. These findings underscore the importance of both the statistical framework and the void classification algorithm in interpreting environmental effects on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal encoder-decoder neural network for forecasting solar wind speed at L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind, accelerated within the solar corona, sculpts the heliosphere and continuously interacts with planetary atmospheres. On Earth, high-speed solar-wind streams may lead to severe disruption of satellite operations and power grids. Accurate and reliable forecasting of the ambient solar-wind speed is therefore highly desirable. This work presents an encoder-decoder neural-network framework for simultaneously forecasting the daily averaged solar-wind speed for the subsequent four days. The encoder-decoder framework is trained with the two different modes of solar observations. The history of solar-wind observations from prior solar-rotations and EUV coronal observations up to four days prior to the current time form the input to two different encoders. The decoder is designed to output the daily averaged solar-wind speed from four days prior to the current time to four days into the future. Our model outputs the solar-wind speed with Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of 55 km/s, 58 km/s, 58 km/s, and 58 km/s and Pearson correlations of 0.78, 0.66, 0.64 and 0.63 for one to four days in advance respectively. While the model is trained and validated on observations between 2010 - 2018, we demonstrate its robustness via application on unseen test data between 2019 - 2023, yielding RMSEs of 53 km/s and Pearson correlations 0.55 for a four-day advance prediction. Our encoder-decoder model thus produces much improved RMSE values compared to the previous works and paves the way for developing comprehensive multimodal deep learning models for operational solar wind forecasting.</description>

      <title>Observation of Astrophysical Sources with SST-1M Telescopes -- First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small Size Cherenkov Telescope (SST-1M) was developed by a consortium of institutes in Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The SST-1M design is based on the Davies-Cotton concept, featuring a 4-meter mirror and an innovative SiPM-based camera. It is most sensitive to gamma rays in the TeV and multi-TeV energy bands. Since 2022, two SST-1M prototypes have been commissioned at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, where their performance in both mono and stereo observation modes is being tested. During the commissioning phase, several galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray sources have been observed, resulting in multiple detections. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from this observation campaign.</description>

      <title>Early Identification of Optical Tidal Disruption Events: A science module for the Fink broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of tidal disruption events (TDEs) is one of the key science goals of large optical time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. However, identifying TDEs in the vast alert streams produced by these surveys requires automated and reliable classification pipelines that can select promising candidates in real time. We developed a module within the Fink alert broker to identify TDEs during their rising phase. It was built to autonomously operate within the ZTF alert stream, producing a list of candidates every night and enabling spectral and multi-wavelength follow-up near peak brightness. All rising alerts are submitted to selection cuts and feature extraction using the Rainbow multi-band lightcurve fit. Best-fit values were used as input to train an XGBoost classifier with the goal of identifying TDEs. The training set was constructed using ZTF observations for objects with available classification in the Transient Name Server. Finally, candidates with high enough probability were visually inspected. The classifier achieves 76% recall, indicating strong performance in early-phase identification, despite the limited available information before peak. We show that, out of the known TDEs that pass the selection cuts, half of them are flagged as TDE before halfway in their rise, proving the feasibility of early classification. Additionally, new candidates were identified by applying the classifier on archival data, including a likely repeated TDE and some potential TDEs occurring in active galaxies.

      <title>Mapping ground-based coronagraphic images to Helioprojective-Cartesian coordinate system by image registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A few ground-based solar coronagraphs have been installed in western China for observing the low-layer corona in recent years. However, determining the Helioprojective Coordinates for the coronagraphic data with high precision is an important but challenging step for further research with other multi-wavelength data. In this paper, we propose an automatic coronal image registration method that combines local statistical correlation and feature point matching to achieve accurate registration between ground-based coronal green-line images and space-based 211 {\AA} images. Then, the accurate field of view information of the coronal green-line images can be derived, allowing the images to be mapped to the Helioprojective Cartesian Coordinates with an accuracy of no less than 0.1''. This method has been extensively validated using 100 days of coronal data spanning an 11-year period, demonstrating its broad applicability to ground-based coronagraphs equipped with green-line observations. It significantly enhances the scientific value of ground-based coronal data, enabling comprehensive studies of coronal transient activities and facilitating the joint analysis of data from multiple instruments. Additionally, it holds potential for future applications in improving the pointing accuracy of coronagraphs.</description>

      <title>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational wave signals using a single event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$, or roughly -0.26 radians. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,2) and (3,3) modes to vary separately and introducing a new waveform parameter to represent the phase offset between the two. We use simulated, asymmetric mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the $-\pi/12$ phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR $\gtrsim$ 40 and $\mathcal{M} \leq 30$. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization, measuring the offset to be $0.13^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$ for GW190412 and $-0.05^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ for GW190814. We also measure the Bayes factor in support of zero phase offset, $\log_{10} \mathcal{B}_{\Delta \varphi = 0}$, to be $-0.14$ for GW190412 and $0.21$ for GW190814. This implies our results are not strong enough to confidently argue if either event is a type II image, and is consistent with our statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Extending the micro-Hertz detection horizons via orbital resonance effect for geocentric gravitational wave antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mu$Hz gravitational wave band holds crucial insights into coalescing supermassive black hole binaries and stochastic backgrounds but remains inaccessible due to technical challenges. We demonstrate that geocentric space-based GW detectors (e.g., TianQin, gLISA, GADFLI) can bridge this gap by considering orbital resonance effects, circumventing the need for prohibitively long baselines. When GW frequencies match with integer multiples of a satellite's orbital frequency, sustained tidal forces induce cumulative orbital deviations through resonant effects, which, combined with orbital modulation, improve detector sensitivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the $\mu$Hz band. Consequently, geocentric missions can detect SMBHBs across significantly expanded mass-redshift parameter space and track their inspiral-merger-ringdown evolution. Crucially, such observations could synergize with pulsar timing array data of the same binaries at earlier inspiral stages, enabling unprecedented joint tests of strong-field gravity and binary evolution. Our findings establish geocentric antennas as a cost-effective, near-term precursor for unlocking the $\mu$Hz GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Multiband parameter estimation with phase coherence and extrinsic marginalization: Extracting more information from low-SNR CBC signals in LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel coherent multiband analysis framework for characterizing stellar- and intermediate-mass binary black holes using LISA and next-generation ground-based detectors (ET and CE), leveraging the latest developments in the \texttt{PyCBC} pipeline. Given the population parameters inferred from LVK results and LISA's sensitivity limits at high frequencies, most stellar-mass binary black holes would likely have SNRs below 5 in LISA, but the most state-of-the-art multiband parameter estimation methods, such as those using ET and CE posteriors as priors for LISA, typically struggle to analyze sources with a LISA SNR less than 5. We present a novel coherent multiband parameter estimation method that directly calculates a joint likelihood, which is highly efficient; this efficiency is enabled by multiband marginalization of the extrinsic parameter space, implemented using importance sampling, which can work robustly even when the LISA SNR is as low as 3. Having an SNR of $\sim 3$ allows LISA to contribute nearly double the number of multiband sources. Even if LISA only observes for one year, most of the multiband detector-frame chirp mass's 90\% credible interval (less than $10^{-4} \mathrm{M}_\odot$) is still better than that of the most accurately measured events for ET+2CE network in 7.5 years of observation, by at least one order of magnitude. For the first time, we show efficient multiband Bayesian parameter estimation results on the population scale, which paves the way for large-scale astrophysical tests using multibanding.</description>

      <title>Hybrid concept of detection for a wide-field gamma-ray observatory using Cherenkov telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hybrid detection approach in astroparticle physics has been successfully employed in cosmic-ray experiments and is currently being explored by gamma-ray observatories like LHAASO. We present a study on the hybrid detection concept for the future Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), integrating multiple Cherenkov telescopes represented in the analysis by Single-Mirror Small-Size imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (SST-1M) located next to the surface array of water Cherenkov detectors (WCDs). We discuss the mutual benefits of this hybrid approach and present simulation-based results on key performances. Our findings points to the fact that the combination of wide field-of-view and continuous operation of WCDs with the high angular and energy resolution of Cherenkov telescopes could significantly improve the overall detection capabilities of the SWGO experiment.</description>
