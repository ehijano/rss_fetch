      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Real-Time Decision-Making in Robotic Soccer for Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of multi-agent systems in dynamic, adversarial environments like robotic soccer necessitates real-time decision-making, sophisticated cooperation, and scalable algorithms to avoid the curse of dimensionality. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that addresses these challenges. First, we establish a baseline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a client-server architecture for real-time action scheduling, with PPO demonstrating superior performance (4.32 avg. goals, 82.9% ball control). Second, we introduce a Hierarchical RL (HRL) structure based on the options framework to decompose the problem into a high-level trajectory planning layer (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and a low-level action execution layer, improving global strategy (avg. goals increased to 5.26). Finally, to ensure scalability, we integrate mean-field theory into the HRL framework, simplifying many-agent interactions into a single agent vs. the population average. Our mean-field actor-critic method achieves a significant performance boost (5.93 avg. goals, 89.1% ball control, 92.3% passing accuracy) and enhanced training stability. Extensive simulations of 4v4 matches in the Webots environment validate our approach, demonstrating its potential for robust, scalable, and cooperative behavior in complex multi-agent domains.</description>

      <title>GRAND: Guidance, Rebalancing, and Assignment for Networked Dispatch in Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large robot fleets are now common in warehouses and other logistics settings, where small control gains translate into large operational impacts. In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.</description>

      <title>KALIKO: Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator Learning For Prediction of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon dynamical prediction is fundamental in robotics and control, underpinning canonical methods like model predictive control. Yet, many systems and disturbance phenomena are difficult to model due to effects like nonlinearity, chaos, and high-dimensionality. Koopman theory addresses this by modeling the linear evolution of embeddings of the state under an infinite-dimensional linear operator that can be approximated with a suitable finite basis of embedding functions, effectively trading model nonlinearity for representational complexity. However, explicitly computing a good choice of basis is nontrivial, and poor choices may cause inaccurate forecasts or overfitting. To address this, we present Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) Learning, a method that leverages the Kalman filter to implicitly learn embeddings corresponding to latent dynamics without requiring an explicit encoder. KALIKO produces interpretable representations consistent with both theory and prior works, yielding high-quality reconstructions and inducing a globally linear latent dynamics. Evaluated on wave data generated by a high-dimensional PDE, KALIKO surpasses several baselines in open-loop prediction and in a demanding closed-loop simulated control task: stabilizing an underactuated manipulator's payload by predicting and compensating for strong wave disturbances.</description>

      <title>GOMP: Grasped Object Manifold Projection for Multimodal Imitation Learning of Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) holds great potential for learning repetitive manipulation tasks, such as those in industrial assembly. However, its effectiveness is often limited by insufficient trajectory precision due to compounding errors. In this paper, we introduce Grasped Object Manifold Projection (GOMP), an interactive method that mitigates these errors by constraining a non-rigidly grasped object to a lower-dimensional manifold. GOMP assumes a precise task in which a manipulator holds an object that may shift within the grasp in an observable manner and must be mated with a grounded part. Crucially, all GOMP enhancements are learned from the same expert dataset used to train the base IL policy, and are adjusted with an n-arm bandit-based interactive component. We propose a theoretical basis for GOMP's improvement upon the well-known compounding error bound in IL literature. We demonstrate the framework on four precise assembly tasks using tactile feedback, and note that the approach remains modality-agnostic. Data and videos are available at williamvdb.github.io/GOMPsite.</description>

      <title>Surfel-LIO: Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry with Pre-computed Surfels and Hierarchical Z-order Voxel Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) is an active research area, as it enables accurate real-time state estimation in GPS-denied environments. Recent advances in map data structures and spatial indexing have significantly improved the efficiency of LIO systems. Nevertheless, we observe that two aspects may still leave room for improvement: (1) nearest neighbor search often requires examining multiple spatial units to gather sufficient points for plane fitting, and (2) plane parameters are typically recomputed at every iteration despite unchanged map geometry. Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation. This design enables O(1) correspondence retrieval without runtime neighbor enumeration or plane fitting, combined with Z-order curve encoding for cache-friendly spatial indexing. Experimental results on the M3DGR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly faster processing speed compared to recent state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable state estimation accuracy. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/93won/lidar_inertial_odometry.</description>

      <title>What Is The Best 3D Scene Representation for Robotics? From Geometric to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics. We have published an open-source project on GitHub and will continue to add new works and technologies to this project.</description>

      <title>World Models for Autonomous Navigation of Terrestrial Robots from LIDAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation of terrestrial robots using Reinforcement Learning (RL) from LIDAR observations remains challenging due to the high dimensionality of sensor data and the sample inefficiency of model-free approaches. Conventional policy networks struggle to process full-resolution LIDAR inputs, forcing prior works to rely on simplified observations that reduce spatial awareness and navigation robustness. This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data.</description>

      <title>PerFACT: Motion Policy with LLM-Powered Dataset Synthesis and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly enhanced motion planning for robotic manipulators by leveraging prior experiences within planning datasets. However, state-of-the-art neural motion planners are primarily trained on small datasets collected in manually generated workspaces, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, these planners often rely on monolithic network architectures that struggle to encode critical planning information. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion Policy with Dataset Synthesis powered by large language models (LLMs) and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers (PerFACT), which incorporates two key components. Firstly, a novel LLM-powered workspace generation method, MotionGeneralizer, enables large-scale planning data collection by producing a diverse set of semantically feasible workspaces. Secondly, we introduce Fusion Motion Policy Networks (MpiNetsFusion), a generalist neural motion planner that uses a fusion action-chunking transformer to better encode planning signals and attend to multiple feature modalities. Leveraging MotionGeneralizer, we collect 3.5M trajectories to train and evaluate MpiNetsFusion against state-of-the-art planners, which shows that the proposed MpiNetsFusion can plan several times faster on the evaluated tasks.</description>

      <title>MSG-Loc: Multi-Label Likelihood-based Semantic Graph Matching for Object-Level Global Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots are often required to localize in environments with unknown object classes and semantic ambiguity. However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments.</description>

      <title>AdaPower: Specializing World Foundation Models for Predictive Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World Foundation Models (WFMs) offer remarkable visual dynamics simulation capabilities, yet their application to precise robotic control remains limited by the gap between generative realism and control-oriented precision. While existing approaches use WFMs as synthetic data generators, they suffer from high computational costs and underutilization of pre-trained VLA policies. We introduce \textbf{AdaPower} (\textbf{Ada}pt and Em\textbf{power}), a lightweight adaptation framework that transforms general-purpose WFMs into specialist world models through two novel components: Temporal-Spatial Test-Time Training (TS-TTT) for inference-time adaptation and Memory Persistence (MP) for long-horizon consistency. Integrated within a Model Predictive Control framework, our adapted world model empowers pre-trained VLAs, achieving over 41\% improvement in task success rates on LIBERO benchmarks without policy retraining, while preserving computational efficiency and generalist capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Control Methodology for Transitioning VTOL UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition control poses a critical challenge in Vertical Take-Off and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTOL UAV) development due to the tilting rotor mechanism, which shifts the center of gravity and thrust direction during transitions. Current control methods' decoupled control of altitude and position leads to significant vibration, and limits interaction consideration and adaptability. In this study, we propose a novel coupled transition control methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) driven controller. Besides, contrasting to the conventional phase-transition approach, the ST3M method demonstrates a new perspective by treating cruise mode as a special case of hover. We validate the feasibility of applying our method in simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating efficient controller development and migration while accurately controlling UAV position and attitude, exhibiting outstanding trajectory tracking and reduced vibrations during the transition process.</description>

      <title>RoboScape-R: Unified Reward-Observation World Models for Generalizable Robotics Training via RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving generalizable embodied policies remains a key challenge. Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Control of Manipulators: Coupling Kinematics and Vision for Self-Driving Laboratory Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning schemes are used for planning motions of a manipulator from an initial pose to a final pose during a task execution. A motion planning scheme generally comprises of a trajectory planning method and an inverse kinematic solver to determine trajectories and joints solutions respectively. In this paper, 3 motion planning schemes developed based on Jacobian methods are implemented to traverse a redundant manipulator with a coupled finger gripper through given trajectories. RRT* algorithm is used for planning trajectories and screw theory based forward kinematic equations are solved for determining joint solutions of the manipulator and gripper. Inverse solutions are computed separately using 3 Jacobian based methods such as Jacobian Transpose (JT), Pseudo Inverse (PI), and Damped Least Square (DLS) methods. Space Jacobian and manipulability measurements of the manipulator and gripper are obtained using screw theory formulations. Smoothness and RMSE error of generated trajectories and velocity continuity, acceleration profile, jerk, and snap values of joint motions are analysed for determining an efficient motion planning method for a given task. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed motion planning schemes mentioned above are analysed using simulation studies to determine a suitable inverse solution technique for the tasks.</description>

      <title>Context-Triggered Contingency Games for Strategic Multi-Agent Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of reliable and efficient interaction in autonomous multi-agent systems, where agents must balance long-term strategic objectives with short-term dynamic adaptation. We propose context-triggered contingency games, a novel integration of strategic games derived from temporal logic specifications with dynamic contingency games solved in real time. Our two-layered architecture leverages strategy templates to guarantee satisfaction of high-level objectives, while a new factor-graph-based solver enables scalable, real-time model predictive control of dynamic interactions. The resulting framework ensures both safety and progress in uncertain, interactive environments. We validate our approach through simulations and hardware experiments in autonomous driving and robotic navigation, demonstrating efficient, reliable, and adaptive multi-agent interaction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous tomato-harvesting system built around a hybrid robotic gripper that combines six soft auxetic fingers with a rigid exoskeleton and a latex basket to achieve gentle, cage-like grasping. The gripper is driven by a servo-actuated Scotch--yoke mechanism, and includes separator leaves that form a conical frustum for fruit isolation, with an integrated micro-servo cutter for pedicel cutting. For perception, an RGB--D camera and a Detectron2-based pipeline perform semantic segmentation of ripe/unripe tomatoes and keypoint localization of the pedicel and fruit center under occlusion and variable illumination. An analytical model derived using the principle of virtual work relates servo torque to grasp force, enabling design-level reasoning about actuation requirements. During execution, closed-loop grasp-force regulation is achieved using a proportional--integral--derivative controller with feedback from force-sensitive resistors mounted on selected fingers to prevent slip and bruising. Motion execution is supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)--based trajectory planning for a 5-DOF manipulator. Experiments demonstrate complete picking cycles (approach, separation, cutting, grasping, transport, release) with an average cycle time of 24.34~s and an overall success rate of approximately 80\%, while maintaining low grasp forces (0.20--0.50~N). These results validate the proposed hybrid gripper and integrated vision--control pipeline for reliable harvesting in cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>ContactRL: Safe Reinforcement Learning based Motion Planning for Contact based Human Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collaborative human-robot tasks, safety requires not only avoiding collisions but also ensuring safe, intentional physical contact. We present ContactRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that directly incorporates contact safety into the reward function through force feedback. This enables a robot to learn adaptive motion profiles that minimize human-robot contact forces while maintaining task efficiency. In simulation, ContactRL achieves a low safety violation rate of 0.2\% with a high task success rate of 87.7\%, outperforming state-of-the-art constrained RL baselines. In order to guarantee deployment safety, we augment the learned policy with a kinetic energy based Control Barrier Function (eCBF) shield. Real-world experiments on an UR3e robotic platform performing small object handovers from a human hand across 360 trials confirm safe contact, with measured normal forces consistently below 10N. These results demonstrate that ContactRL enables safe and efficient physical collaboration, thereby advancing the deployment of collaborative robots in contact-rich tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The US Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Autonomous Planning In-space Assembly Reinforcement-learning free-flYer (APIARY) experiment pioneers the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for control of free-flying robots in the zero-gravity (zero-G) environment of space. On Tuesday, May 27th 2025 the APIARY team conducted the first ever, to our knowledge, RL control of a free-flyer in space using the NASA Astrobee robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). A robust 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) control policy was trained using an actor-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment, randomizing over goal poses and mass distributions to enhance robustness. This paper details the simulation testing, ground testing, and flight validation of this experiment. This on-orbit demonstration validates the transformative potential of RL for improving robotic autonomy, enabling rapid development and deployment (in minutes to hours) of tailored behaviors for space exploration, logistics, and real-time mission needs.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Sim2Real Gap Between Simulation and Ground Testing to Space Deployment of Autonomous Free-flyer Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers transformative potential for robotic control in space. We present the first on-orbit demonstration of RL-based autonomous control of a free-flying robot, the NASA Astrobee, aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using NVIDIA's Omniverse physics simulator and curriculum learning, we trained a deep neural network to replace Astrobee's standard attitude and translation control, enabling it to navigate in microgravity. Our results validate a novel training pipeline that bridges the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap, utilizing a GPU-accelerated, scientific-grade simulation environment for efficient Monte Carlo RL training. This successful deployment demonstrates the feasibility of training RL policies terrestrially and transferring them to space-based applications. This paves the way for future work in In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM), enabling rapid on-orbit adaptation to dynamic mission requirements.</description>

      <title>Cross-embodied Co-design for Dexterous Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks. This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Driven Motion Planning: Route Integration Strategies in Attention-Based Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining motion prediction and motion planning offers a promising framework for enhancing interactions between automated vehicles and other traffic participants. However, this introduces challenges in conditioning predictions on navigation goals and ensuring stable, kinematically feasible trajectories. Addressing the former challenge, this paper investigates the extension of attention-based motion prediction models with navigation information. By integrating the ego vehicle's intended route and goal pose into the model architecture, we bridge the gap between multi-agent motion prediction and goal-based motion planning. We propose and evaluate several architectural navigation integration strategies to our model on the nuPlan dataset. Our results demonstrate the potential of prediction-driven motion planning, highlighting how navigation information can enhance both prediction and planning tasks. Our implementation is at: https://github.com/KIT-MRT/future-motion.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Automatic Tuning of Torque-Level Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an auto-tuning framework for torque-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (nMPC), where the MPC serves as a real-time controller for optimal joint torque commands. The MPC parameters, including cost function weights and low-level controller gains, are optimized using high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques, specifically Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace (SAASBO) with a digital twin (DT) to achieve precise end-effector trajectory real-time tracking on an UR10e robot arm. The simulation model allows efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space, and it ensures safe transfer to hardware. Our simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in tracking performance (+41.9%) and reduction in solve times (-2.5%) compared to manually-tuned parameters. Moreover, experimental validation on the real robot follows the trend (with a +25.8% improvement), emphasizing the importance of digital twin-enabled automated parameter optimization for robotic operations.</description>

      <title>Safety Reinforced Model Predictive Control (SRMPC): Improving MPC with Reinforcement Learning for Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used for motion planning, particularly in autonomous driving. Real-time capability of the planner requires utilizing convex approximation of optimal control problems (OCPs) for the planner. However, such approximations confine the solution to a subspace, which might not contain the global optimum. To address this, we propose using safe reinforcement learning (SRL) to obtain a new and safe reference trajectory within MPC. By employing a learning-based approach, the MPC can explore solutions beyond the close neighborhood of the previous one, potentially finding global optima. We incorporate constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to ensure safety in automated driving, using a handcrafted energy function-based safety index as the constraint objective to model safe and unsafe regions. Our approach utilizes a state-dependent Lagrangian multiplier, learned concurrently with the safe policy, to solve the CRL problem. Through experimentation in a highway scenario, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both MPC and SRL in terms of safety and performance measures.</description>

      <title>MPCFormer: A physics-informed data-driven approach for explainable socially-aware autonomous driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer. Results show that MPCFormer achieves the highest planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and reduces the collision rate from 21.25% to 0.5%, outperforming a frontier Reinforcement Learning (RL) based planner.</description>

      <title>IM HERE: Interaction Model for Human Effort Based Robot Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of human-robot interaction often hinges on the ability to cultivate engagement - a dynamic process of cognitive involvement that supports meaningful exchanges. Many existing definitions and models of engagement are either too vague or lack the ability to generalize across different contexts. We introduce IM HERE, a novel framework that models engagement effectively in human-human, human-robot, and robot-robot interactions. By employing an effort-based description of bilateral relationships between entities, we provide an accurate breakdown of relationship patterns, simplifying them to focus placement and four key states. This framework captures mutual relationships, group behaviors, and actions conforming to social norms, translating them into specific directives for autonomous systems. By integrating both subjective perceptions and objective states, the model precisely identifies and describes miscommunication. The primary objective of this paper is to automate the analysis, modeling, and description of social behavior, and to determine how autonomous systems can behave in accordance with social norms for full social integration while simultaneously pursuing their own social goals.</description>

      <title>OmniDexVLG: Learning Dexterous Grasp Generation from Vision Language Model-Guided Grasp Semantics, Taxonomy and Functional Affordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous grasp generation aims to produce grasp poses that align with task requirements and human interpretable grasp semantics. However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-based Control Co-Design of Full Vehicle Active Suspensions via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active suspension systems are critical for enhancing vehicle comfort, safety, and stability, yet their performance is often limited by fixed hardware designs and control strategies that cannot adapt to uncertain and dynamic operating conditions. Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Reinforcement Learning Robot Control with Intel's Loihi 2 Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end pipeline for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on neuromorphic hardware by converting them into spiking Sigma-Delta Neural Networks (SDNNs). We demonstrate that an ANN policy trained entirely in simulation can be transformed into an SDNN compatible with Intel's Loihi 2 architecture, enabling low-latency and energy-efficient inference. As a test case, we use an RL policy for controlling the Astrobee free-flying robot, similar to a previously hardware in space-validated controller. The policy, trained with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), is converted to an SDNN and deployed on Intel's Loihi 2, then evaluated in NVIDIA's Omniverse Isaac Lab simulation environment for closed-loop control of Astrobee's motion. We compare execution performance between GPU and Loihi 2. The results highlight the feasibility of using neuromorphic platforms for robotic control and establish a pathway toward energy-efficient, real-time neuromorphic computation in future space and terrestrial robotics applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Vision Language Action Model Using Success and Failure Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically trained on teleoperated successful demonstrations, while discarding numerous failed attempts that occur naturally during data collection. However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution.</description>

      <title>Driving is a Game: Combining Planning and Prediction with Bayesian Iterative Best Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving planning systems perform nearly perfectly in routine scenarios using lightweight, rule-based methods but still struggle in dense urban traffic, where lane changes and merges require anticipating and influencing other agents. Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models. Experiments show that BIBeR achieves an 11% improvement over state-of-the-art planners on highly interactive interPlan lane-change scenarios, while also outperforming existing approaches on standard nuPlan benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MDE-AgriVLN: Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation with Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural robots are serving as powerful assistants across a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily relying on manual operations or railway systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling a robot to navigate to a target position following a natural language instruction. Unlike human binocular vision, most agricultural robots are only given a single camera for monocular vision, which results in limited spatial perception. To bridge this gap, we present the method of Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation with Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE-AgriVLN), in which we propose the MDE module generating depth features from RGB images, to assist the decision-maker on reasoning. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our MDE-AgriVLN method successfully increases Success Rate from 0.23 to 0.32 and decreases Navigation Error from 4.43m to 4.08m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural VLN domain.

      <title>Artificial Microsaccade Compensation: Stable Vision for an Ornithopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals with foveated vision, including humans, experience microsaccades, small, rapid eye movements that they are not aware of. Inspired by this phenomenon, we develop a method for "Artificial Microsaccade Compensation". It can stabilize video captured by a tailless ornithopter that has resisted attempts to use camera-based sensing because it shakes at 12-20 Hz. Our approach minimizes changes in image intensity by optimizing over 3D rotation represented in SO(3). This results in a stabilized video, computed in real time, suitable for human viewing, and free from distortion. When adapted to hold a fixed viewing orientation, up to occasional saccades, it can dramatically reduce inter-frame motion while also benefiting from an efficient recursive update. When compared to Adobe Premier Pro's warp stabilizer, which is widely regarded as the best commercial video stabilization software available, our method achieves higher quality results while also running in real time.</description>

      <title>Flux4D: Flow-based Unsupervised 4D Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an "as static as possible" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>NavMapFusion: Diffusion-based Fusion of Navigation Maps for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

      <title>Variable-Impedance Muscle Coordination under Slow-Rate Control Frequencies and Limited Observation Conditions Evaluated through Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motor control remains agile and robust despite limited sensory information for feedback, a property attributed to the body's ability to perform morphological computation through muscle coordination with variable impedance. However, it remains unclear how such low-level mechanical computation reduces the control requirements of the high-level controller. In this study, we implement a hierarchical controller consisting of a high-level neural network trained by reinforcement learning and a low-level variable-impedance muscle coor dination model with mono- and biarticular muscles in monoped locomotion task. We systematically restrict the high-level controller by varying the control frequency and by introducing biologically inspired observation conditions: delayed, partial, and substituted observation. Under these conditions, we evaluate how the low-level variable-impedance muscle coordination contributes to learning process of high-level neural network. The results show that variable-impedance muscle coordination enables stable locomotion even under slow-rate control frequency and limited observation conditions. These findings demonstrate that the morphological computation of muscle coordination effectively offloads high-frequency feedback of the high-level controller and provide a design principle for the controller in motor control.</description>

      <title>CSMapping: Scalable Crowdsourced Semantic Mapping and Topology Inference for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crowdsourcing enables scalable autonomous driving map construction, but low-cost sensor noise hinders quality from improving with data volume. We propose CSMapping, a system that produces accurate semantic maps and topological road centerlines whose quality consistently increases with more crowdsourced data. For semantic mapping, we train a latent diffusion model on HD maps (optionally conditioned on SD maps) to learn a generative prior of real-world map structure, without requiring paired crowdsourced/HD-map supervision. This prior is incorporated via constrained MAP optimization in latent space, ensuring robustness to severe noise and plausible completion in unobserved areas. Initialization uses a robust vectorized mapping module followed by diffusion inversion; optimization employs efficient Gaussian-basis reparameterization, projected gradient descent zobracket multi-start, and latent-space factor-graph for global consistency. For topological mapping, we apply confidence-weighted k-medoids clustering and kinematic refinement to trajectories, yielding smooth, human-like centerlines robust to trajectory variation. Experiments on nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and a large proprietary dataset achieve state-of-the-art semantic and topological mapping performance, with thorough ablation and scalability studies.</description>

      <title>Mobility Induced Sensitivity of UAV based Nodes to Jamming in Private 5G Airfield Networks An Experimental Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an experimental performance evaluation of a private 5G airfield network under controlled directional SDR jamming attacks targeting UAV-based UE nodes. Using a QualiPoc Android UE, mounted as a payload on a quadcopter UAV, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate signal degradation, handover performance, and ser-vice stability in the presence of constant directional jamming. The conducted experiments aimed to examine the effects of varying travel speeds, altitudes, and moving patterns of a UAV-based UE to record and analyze the key physical-layer and network-layer metrics such as CQI, MCS, RSRP, SINR, BLER, Net PDSCH Throughput and RLF. The re-sults of this work describe the link stability and signal degradation dependencies, caused by the level of mobility of the UAV-based UE nodes during autonomous and automatic operation in private 5G Airfield networks</description>

      <title>PosA-VLA: Enhancing Action Generation via Pose-Conditioned Anchor Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.</description>

      <title>MUT3R: Motion-aware Updating Transformer for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent stateful recurrent neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on static 3D reconstruction but remain vulnerable to motion-induced artifacts, where non-rigid regions corrupt attention propagation between the spatial memory and image feature. By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Classification of User Satisfaction in HRI with Social Signals in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Socially interactive agents (SIAs) are being used in various scenarios and are nearing productive deployment. Evaluating user satisfaction with SIAs' performance is a key factor in designing the interaction between the user and SIA. Currently, subjective user satisfaction is primarily assessed manually through questionnaires or indirectly via system metrics. This study examines the automatic classification of user satisfaction through analysis of social signals, aiming to enhance both manual and autonomous evaluation methods for SIAs. During a field trial at the Deutsches Museum Bonn, a Furhat Robotics head was employed as a service and information hub, collecting an "in-the-wild" dataset. This dataset comprises 46 single-user interactions, including questionnaire responses and video data. Our method focuses on automatically classifying user satisfaction based on time series classification. We use time series of social signal metrics derived from the body pose, time series of facial expressions, and physical distance. This study compares three feature engineering approaches on different machine learning models. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in reliably identifying interactions with low user satisfaction without the need for manually annotated datasets. This approach offers significant potential for enhancing SIA performance and user experience through automated feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>When to Say "Hi" - Learn to Open a Conversation with an in-the-wild Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social capabilities of socially interactive agents (SIA) are a key to successful and smooth interactions between the user and the SIA. A successful start of the interaction is one of the essential factors for satisfying SIA interactions. For a service and information task in which the SIA helps with information, e.g. about the location, it is an important skill to master the opening of the conversation and to recognize which interlocutor opens the conversation and when. We are therefore investigating the extent to which the opening of the conversation can be trained using the user's body language as an input for machine learning to ensure smooth conversation starts for the interaction. In this paper we propose the Interaction Initiation System (IIS) which we developed, trained and validated using an in-the-wild data set. In a field test at the Deutsches Museum Bonn, a Furhat robot from Furhat Robotics was used as a service and information point. Over the period of use we collected the data of \textit{N} = 201 single user interactions for the training of the algorithms. We can show that the IIS, achieves a performance that allows the conclusion that this system is able to determine the greeting period and the opener of the interaction.</description>

      <title>SpaceTools: Tool-Augmented Spatial Reasoning via Double Interactive RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong qualitative visual understanding, but struggle with metrically precise spatial reasoning required for embodied applications. The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines. Project page: https://spacetools.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: The tremendous hype around autonomous driving is eagerly calling for emerging and novel technologies to support advanced mobility use cases. As car manufactures keep developing SAE level 3+ systems to improve the safety and comfort of passengers, traffic authorities need to establish new procedures to manage the transition from human-driven to fully-autonomous vehicles while providing a feedback-loop mechanism to fine-tune envisioned autonomous systems. Thus, a way to automatically profile autonomous vehicles and differentiate those from human-driven ones is a must. In this paper, we present a fully-fledged framework that monitors active vehicles using camera images and state information in order to determine whether vehicles are autonomous, without requiring any active notification from the vehicles themselves. Essentially, it builds on the cooperation among vehicles, which share their data acquired on the road feeding a machine learning model to identify autonomous cars. We extensively tested our solution and created the NexusStreet dataset, by means of the CARLA simulator, employing an autonomous driving control agent and a steering wheel maneuvered by licensed drivers. Experiments show it is possible to discriminate the two behaviors by analyzing video clips with an accuracy of 80%, which improves up to 93% when the target state information is available. Lastly, we deliberately degraded the state to observe how the framework performs under non-ideal data collection conditions.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Based Sliding Mode Control for Six Degrees of Freedom Flight Control of Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on sliding mode control (SMC) design for quadrotors, the existing approaches suffer from certain limitations. Euler angle-based SMC formulations suffer from poor performance in high-pitch or -roll maneuvers. Quaternion-based SMC approaches have unwinding issues and complex architecture. Coordinate-free methods are slow and only almost globally stable. This paper presents a new six degrees of freedom SMC flight controller to address the above limitations. We use a cascaded architecture with a position controller in the outer loop and a quaternion-based attitude controller in the inner loop. The position controller generates the desired trajectory for the attitude controller using a coordinate-free approach. The quaternion-based attitude controller uses the natural characteristics of the quaternion hypersphere, featuring a simple structure while providing global stability and avoiding unwinding issues. We compare our controller with three other common control methods conducting challenging maneuvers like flip-over and high-speed trajectory tracking in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Our controller consistently outperforms the benchmark approaches with less control effort and actuator saturation, offering highly effective and efficient flight control.</description>

      <title>MP1: MeanFlow Tames Policy Learning in 1-step for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10543v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach. However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our project page is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/, and the code can be accessed at https://github.com/LogSSim/MP1.</description>

      <title>FPC-VLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework with a Supervisor for Failure Prediction and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A dual-stream fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and Reactive Planning in Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SHARP (Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and Reactive Planning), a proof-of-concept study demonstrating how high-performance computing (HPC) can enable millisecond-scale responsiveness in robotic control. While modern robots face increasing demands for reactivity in human--robot shared workspaces, onboard processors are constrained by size, power, and cost. Offloading to HPC offers massive parallelism for trajectory planning, but its feasibility for real-time robotics remains uncertain due to network latency and jitter. We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator must dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a parallelized multi-goal A* search implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system achieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300 km away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These results show that when round-trip latency remains within the tens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck, enabling avoidance well below human reaction times. The SHARP results motivate hybrid control architectures: low-level reflexes remain onboard for safety, while bursty, high-throughput planning tasks are offloaded to HPC for scalability. By reporting per-stage timing and success rates, this study provides a reproducible template for assessing real-time feasibility of HPC-driven robotics. Collectively, SHARP reframes HPC offloading as a viable pathway toward dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Tactile-Driven Soft Actuator for Intelligent Grasping and Firmness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft robots are powerful tools for manipulating delicate objects, yet their adoption is hindered by two gaps: the lack of integrated tactile sensing and sensor signal distortion caused by actuator deformations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the SoftMag actuator: a magnetic tactile-sensorized soft actuator. Unlike systems relying on attached sensors or treating sensing and actuation separately, SoftMag unifies them through a shared architecture while confronting the mechanical parasitic effect, where deformations corrupt tactile signals. A multiphysics simulation framework models this coupling, and a neural-network-based decoupling strategy removes the parasitic component, restoring sensing fidelity. Experiments including indentation, quasi-static and step actuation, and fatigue tests validate the actuator's performance and decoupling effectiveness. Building upon this foundation, the system is extended into a two-finger SoftMag gripper, where a multi-task neural network enables real-time prediction of tri-axial contact forces and position. Furthermore, a probing-based strategy estimates object firmness during grasping. Validation on apricots shows a strong correlation (Pearson r over 0.8) between gripper-estimated firmness and reference measurements, confirming the system's capability for non-destructive quality assessment. Results demonstrate that combining integrated magnetic sensing, learning-based correction, and real-time inference enables a soft robotic platform that adapts its grasp and quantifies material properties. The framework offers an approach for advancing sensorized soft actuators toward intelligent, material-aware robotics.</description>

      <title>Diagnose, Correct, and Learn from Manipulation Failures via Visual Symbols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

      <title>SwarmDiffusion: End-To-End Traversability-Guided Diffusion for Embodiment-Agnostic Navigation of Heterogeneous Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual traversability estimation is critical for autonomous navigation, but existing VLM-based methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across embodiments, and output only traversability maps, leaving trajectory generation to slow external planners. We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100% navigation success and 0.09s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.</description>

      <title>DynamicCity: Large-Scale 4D Occupancy Generation from Dynamic Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban scene generation has been developing rapidly recently. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating static and single-frame scenes, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of real-world driving environments. In this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D occupancy generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality dynamic 4D scenes with semantics. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. 1) A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an Expansion &amp; Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded Rollout Operation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as trajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and Waymo datasets demonstrate that DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D occupancy generation methods across multiple metrics. The code and models have been released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control: A proactive right-of-way protection approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems have been widely commercialized in recent years. However, existing ACC systems remain vulnerable to close-range cut-ins, a behavior that resembles "road bullying". To address this issue, this research proposes an Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control (AACC) approach, which is capable of proactively protecting right-of-way against such "road bullying" cut-ins. To handle diverse "road bullying" cut-in scenarios smoothly, the proposed approach first leverages an online Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) based algorithm for individual driving style identification. Then, based on Stackelberg competition, a game-theoretic-based motion planning framework is presented in which the identified individual driving styles are utilized to formulate cut-in vehicles' reaction functions. By integrating such reaction functions into the ego vehicle's motion planning, the ego vehicle could consider cut-in vehicles' all possible reactions to find its optimal right-of-way protection maneuver. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to model vehicles' interaction dynamics and develop an interactive planner that adapts cut-in vehicle's various driving styles. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can prevent "road bullying" cut-ins and be adaptive to different cut-in vehicles' driving styles. It can improve safety and comfort by up to 79.8% and 20.4%. The driving efficiency has benefits by up to 19.33% in traffic flow. The proposed approach can also adopt more flexible driving strategies. Furthermore, the proposed approach can support real-time field implementation by ensuring less than 50 milliseconds computation time.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have revolutionized visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding, particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>AugMapNet: Improving Spatial Latent Structure via BEV Grid Augmentation for Enhanced Vectorized Online HD Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires understanding infrastructure elements, such as lanes and crosswalks. To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV feature grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining easy to integrate compared to other hybrid approaches. It additionally benefits from extra processing on its latent BEV features. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements on vectorized map prediction of up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60 m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline, SQD-MapNet, and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement.

      <title>Nonlinear Oscillatory Response of Automated Vehicle Car-following: Theoretical Analysis with Traffic State and Control Input Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework grounded in the theory of describing function (DF) and incremental-input DF to theoretically analyze the nonlinear oscillatory response of automated vehicles (AVs) car-following (CF) amidst traffic oscillations, considering the limits of traffic state and control input. While prevailing approaches largely ignore these limits (i.e., saturation of acceleration/deceleration and speed) and focus on linear string stability analysis, this framework establishes a basis for theoretically analyzing the frequency response of AV systems with nonlinearities imposed by these limits. To this end, trajectories of CF pairs are decomposed into nominal and oscillatory trajectories, subsequently, the controlled AV system is repositioned within the oscillatory trajectory coordinates. Built on this base, DFs are employed to approximate the frequency responses of nonlinear saturation components by using their first harmonic output, thereby capturing the associated amplification ratio and phase shift. Considering the closed-loop nature of AV control systems, where system states and control input mutually influence each other, amplification ratios and phase shifts are balanced within the loop to ensure consistency. This balancing process may render multiple solutions, hence the incremental-input DF is further applied to identify the reasonable ones. The proposed method is validated by estimations from Simulink, and further comparisons with prevailing methods are conducted. Results confirm the alignment of our framework with Simulink results and exhibit its superior accuracy in analysis compared to the prevailing methods. Furthermore, the framework proves valuable in string stability analysis, especially when conventional linear methods offer misleading insights.</description>

      <title>3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field.

      <title>DGFusion: Depth-Guided Sensor Fusion for Robust Semantic Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses. State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DeLiVER datasets.

      <title>HybridWorldSim: A Scalable and Controllable High-fidelity Simulator for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic and controllable simulation is critical for advancing end-to-end autonomous driving, yet existing approaches often struggle to support novel view synthesis under large viewpoint changes or to ensure geometric consistency. We introduce HybridWorldSim, a hybrid simulation framework that integrates multi-traversal neural reconstruction for static backgrounds with generative modeling for dynamic agents. This unified design addresses key limitations of previous methods, enabling the creation of diverse and high-fidelity driving scenarios with reliable visual and spatial consistency. To facilitate robust benchmarking, we further release a new multi-traversal dataset MIRROR that captures a wide range of routes and environmental conditions across different cities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HybridWorldSim surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, providing a practical and scalable solution for high-fidelity simulation and a valuable resource for research and development in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>SMP: Reusable Score-Matching Motion Priors for Physics-Based Character Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters. Video demo available at https://youtu.be/ravlZJteS20</description>
